The signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases The first phase begins within hours of overdose and consists of nausea vomiting a pale appearance and sweating However patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning Rarely after massive overdoses patients may develop symptoms of metabolic acidosis and coma early in the course of poisoning The second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage In general damage occurs in liver cells as they metabolize the paracetamol The individual may experience right upper quadrant abdominal pain The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function International normalized ratio INR and the liver transaminases ALT and AST rise to abnormal levels Acute kidney failure may also occur during this phase typically caused by either hepatorenal syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome In some cases acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity In these cases it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver The third phase follows at 3 to 5 days and is marked by complications of massive liver necrosis leading to fulminant liver failure with complications of coagulation defects low blood sugar kidney failure hepatic encephalopathy brain swelling sepsis multiple organ failure and death If the third phase is survived the liver necrosis runs its course and liver and kidney function typically return to normal in a few weeks The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received
Features that may result from a high level of GH or expanding tumor include Headaches often severe and prolonged Soft tissue swelling visibly resulting in enlargement of the hands feet nose lips and ears and a general thickening of the skin Soft tissue swelling of internal organs notably the heart with the attendant weakening of its muscularity and the kidneys also the vocal cords resulting in a characteristic thick deep voice and slowing of speech Generalized expansion of the skull at the fontanelle Pronounced brow protrusion often with ocular distension frontal bossing Pronounced lower jaw protrusion prognathism with attendant macroglossia enlargement of the tongue and teeth spacing Hypertrichosis hyperpigmentation and hyperhidrosis may occur in these people 499 Skin tags Carpal tunnel syndrome
Actinic keratoses AKs most commonly present as a white scaly plaque of variable thickness with surrounding redness they are most notable for having a sandpaper like texture when felt with a gloved hand Skin nearby the lesion often shows evidence of solar damage characterized by notable pigmentary alterations being yellow or pale in color with areas of hyperpigmentation deep wrinkles coarse texture purpura and ecchymoses dry skin and scattered telangiectasias are also characteristic Photoaging leads to an accumulation of oncogenic changes resulting in a proliferation of mutated keratinocytes that can manifest as AKs or other neoplastic growths With years of sun damage it is possible to develop multiple AKs in a single area on the skin This condition is termed field cancerization The lesions are usually asymptomatic but can be tender itch bleed or produce a stinging or burning sensation AKs are typically graded in accordance with their clinical presentation Grade I easily visible slightly palpable Grade II easily visible palpable and Grade III frankly visible and hyperkeratotic
The symptoms of CAH vary depending upon the form of CAH and the sex of the patient Symptoms can include Due to inadequate mineralocorticoids Vomiting due to salt wasting leading to dehydration and deathDue to excess androgens
Adrenocortical carcinoma may present differently in children and adults Most tumors in children are functional and virilization is by far the most common presenting symptom s followed by Cushings syndrome and precocious puberty Among adults presenting with hormonal syndromes Cushings syndrome alone is most common followed by mixed Cushings and virilization glucocorticoid and androgen overproduction Feminization and Conn syndrome mineralocorticoid excess occur in less than 10 of cases Rarely pheochromocytoma like hypersecretion of catecholamines has been reported in adrenocortical cancers Nonfunctional tumors about 40 authorities vary usually present with abdominal or flank pain varicocele and renal vein thrombosis or they may be asymptomatic and detected incidentally All patients with suspected ACC should be carefully evaluated for signs and symptoms of hormonal syndromes For Cushings syndrome glucocorticoid excess these include weight gain muscle wasting purple lines on the abdomen a fatty buffalo hump on the neck a moon like face and thinning fragile skin Virilism androgen excess is most obvious in women and may produce excess facial and body hair acne enlargement of the clitoris deepening of the voice coarsening of facial features cessation of menstruation Conn syndrome mineralcorticoid excess is marked by high blood pressure which can result in headache and hypokalemia low serum potassium which can in turn produce muscle weakness confusion and palpitations low plasma renin activity and high serum aldosterone Feminization estrogen excess is most readily noted in men and includes breast enlargement decreased libido and impotence
Signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal occur primarily in the central nervous system The severity of withdrawal can vary from mild symptoms such as insomnia trembling and anxiety to severe and life threatening symptoms such as alcoholic hallucinosis delirium tremens and autonomic instability Withdrawal usually begins 6 to 24 hours after the last drink It can last for up to one week To be classified as alcohol withdrawal syndrome patients must exhibit at least two of the following symptoms increased hand tremor insomnia nausea or vomiting transient hallucinations auditory visual or tactile psychomotor agitation anxiety generalized tonic clonic seizures and autonomic instability The severity of symptoms is dictated by a number of factors the most important of which are degree of alcohol intake length of time the individual has been using alcohol and previous history of alcohol withdrawal Symptoms are also grouped together and classified
Typical first symptoms of alopecia areata are small bald patches The underlying skin is unscarred and looks superficially normal Although these patches can take many shapes they are usually round or oval Alopecia areata most often affects the scalp and beard but may occur on any part of the body with hair Different areas of the skin may exhibit hair loss and regrowth at the same time The disease may also go into remission for a time or may be permanent It is common in children The area of hair loss may tingle or be mildly painful The hair tends to fall out over a short period of time with the loss commonly occurring more on one side of the scalp than the other Exclamation point hairs narrower along the length of the strand closer to the base producing a characteristic exclamation point appearance are often present These hairs are very short 3 4 mm and can be seen surrounding the bald patches When healthy hair is pulled out at most a few should come out and ripped hair should not be distributed evenly across the tugged portion of the scalp In cases of alopecia areata hair tends to pull out more easily along the edge of the patch where the follicles are already being attacked by the bodys immune system than away from the patch where they are still healthy Nails may have pitting or trachyonychia
People have different susceptibilities to altitude sickness for some otherwise healthy people acute altitude sickness can begin to appear at around 2 000 metres 6 600 ft above sea level such as at many mountain ski resorts equivalent to a pressure of 80 kilopascals 0 79 atm This is the most frequent type of altitude sickness encountered Symptoms often manifest within ten hours of ascent and generally subside within two days though they occasionally develop into the more serious conditions Symptoms include headache confusion fatigue stomach illness dizziness and sleep disturbance Exertion may aggravate the symptoms Those individuals with the lowest initial partial pressure of end tidal pCO2 the lowest concentration of carbon dioxide at the end of the respiratory cycle a measure of a higher alveolar ventilation and corresponding high oxygen saturation levels tend to have a lower incidence of acute mountain sickness than those with high end tidal pCO2 and low oxygen saturation levels
Many people with amblyopia especially those who only have a mild form are not aware they have the condition until tested at older ages since the vision in their stronger eye is normal People with amblyopia typically have poor stereo vision since it requires both eyes They further may have on the affected eye poor pattern recognition poor visual acuity and low sensitivity to contrast and motion Amblyopia is characterized by several functional abnormalities in spatial vision including reductions in visual acuity contrast sensitivity function and vernier acuity as well as spatial distortion abnormal spatial interactions and impaired contour detection In addition individuals with amblyopia have binocular abnormalities such as impaired stereoacuity stereoscopic acuity and abnormal binocular summation Also central vision in amblyopes is more crowded than central vision in normal observers These deficits are usually specific to the amblyopic eye Subclinical deficits of the better eye have also been demonstrated People with amblyopia also have problems of binocular vision such as limited stereoscopic depth perception and usually have difficulty seeing the three dimensional images in hidden stereoscopic displays such as autostereograms Perception of depth from monocular cues such as size perspective and motion parallax remains normal
Most infected people about 90 are asymptomatic but this disease has the potential to become serious It is estimated that about 40 000 to 100 000 people worldwide die annually due to amoebiasis Infections can sometimes last for years if there is no treatment Symptoms take from a few days to a few weeks to develop and manifest themselves but usually it is about two to four weeks Symptoms can range from mild diarrhea to dysentery with blood coupled with intense abdominal pains Extra intestinal complications might also arise as a result of invasive infection which includes colitis liver lung or brain abscesses The blood comes from bleeding lesions created by the amoebae invading the lining of the colon In about 10 of invasive cases the amoebae enter the bloodstream and may travel to other organs in the body Most commonly this means the liver as this is where blood from the intestine reaches first but they can end up almost anywhere in the body Onset time is highly variable and the average asymptomatic infection persists for over a year It is theorized that the absence of symptoms or their intensity may vary with such factors as strain of amoeba immune response of the host and perhaps associated bacteria and viruses In asymptomatic infections the amoeba lives by eating and digesting bacteria and food particles in the gut a part of the gastrointestinal tract It does not usually come in contact with the intestine itself due to the protective layer of mucus that lines the gut Disease occurs when amoeba comes in contact with the cells lining the intestine It then secretes the same substances it uses to digest bacteria which include enzymes that destroy cell membranes and proteins This process can lead to penetration and digestion of human tissues resulting first in flask shaped ulcerations in the intestine Entamoeba histolytica ingests the destroyed cells by phagocytosis and is often seen with red blood cells a process known as erythrophagocytosis inside when viewed in stool samples Especially in Latin America a granulomatous mass known as an amoeboma may form in the wall of the ascending colon or rectum due to long lasting immunological cellular response and is sometimes confused with cancer The ingestion of one viable cyst may cause an infection Steroid therapy can occasionally provoke severe amoebic colitis in people with any E histolytica infection This bears high mortality on average more than 50 with severe colitis die
Classic signs and symptoms of anaplasmosis will not occur until 3 6 weeks after infection The most common symptoms of anaplasmosis include fever a decreased number of white blood cells platelets in the bloodstream and abnormally elevated levels of liver enzymes The erythema chronicum migrans rash may be seen with anaplasmosis as it is co transmitted in 10 of Lyme disease cases Anemia may be severe and result in cardiovascular changes such as an increase in heart rate Blood in the urine may occur due to the lysis of red blood cells General systemic signs include diarrhea anorexia and weight loss Infected animals may develop a jaundiced look which then turns into paleness around the eyes muzzle lips and teats of the cattle All cattle are susceptible to infection by Anaplasma marginale but the severity worsens with age increase Older cattle tend to exhibit the most severe clinical symptoms cattle aged 1 3 may also show severe symptoms but are able to recover easier
Initial presenting symptoms most commonly are headache depressed mental status focal neurological deficits and or seizures The growth rate and mean interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis is approximately 1 5 2 years but is highly variable being intermediate between that of low grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas Seizures are less common among patients with anaplastic astrocytomas compared to low grade lesions
Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by attempts to lose weight to the point of starvation A person with anorexia nervosa may exhibit a number of signs and symptoms the type and severity of which may vary and be present but not readily apparent Anorexia nervosa and the associated malnutrition that results from self imposed starvation can cause complications in every major organ system in the body Hypokalaemia a drop in the level of potassium in the blood is a sign of anorexia nervosa A significant drop in potassium can cause abnormal heart rhythms constipation fatigue muscle damage and paralysis Signs and symptoms may be classified in physical cognitive affective behavioral and perceptual
Skin Cutaneous anthrax also known as hide porters disease is when anthrax occurs on the skin It is the most common form 90 of anthrax cases It is the least dangerous form low mortality with treatment 23 7 mortality without Cutaneous anthrax presents as a boil like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer with a black center eschar The black eschar often shows up as a large painless necrotic ulcer beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot somewhat resembling bread mold at the site of infection In general cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure Unlike bruises or most other lesions cutaneous anthrax infections normally do not cause pain Nearby lymph nodes may become infected reddened swollen and painful A scab forms over the lesion soon and falls off in a few weeks Complete recovery may take longer Cutaneous anthrax is typically caused when B anthracis spores enter through cuts on the skin This form is found most commonly when humans handle infected animals and or animal products
Persons with aphthous stomatitis have no detectable systemic symptoms or signs i e outside the mouth Generally symptoms may include prodromal sensations such as burning itching or stinging which may precede the appearance of any lesion by some hours and pain which is often out of proportion to the extent of the ulceration and is worsened by physical contact especially with certain foods and drinks e g if they are acidic or abrasive Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer and then recedes as healing progresses If there are lesions on the tongue speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable and ulcers on the soft palate back of the throat or esophagus can cause painful swallowing Signs are limited to the lesions themselves Ulceration episodes usually occur about 3 6 times per year However severe disease is characterized by virtually constant ulceration new lesions developing before old ones have healed and may cause debilitating chronic pain and interfere with comfortable eating In severe cases this prevents adequate nutrient intake leading to malnutrition and weight loss Aphthous ulcers typically begin as erythematous macules reddened flat area of mucosa which develop into ulcers that are covered with a yellow grey fibrinous membrane that can be scraped away A reddish halo surrounds the ulcer The size number location healing time and periodicity between episodes of ulcer formation are all dependent upon the subtype of aphthous stomatitis
Symptoms of arsenic poisoning begin with headaches confusion severe diarrhea and drowsiness As the poisoning develops convulsions and changes in fingernail pigmentation called leukonychia striata Meess lines or Aldrich Meess lines may occur When the poisoning becomes acute symptoms may include diarrhea vomiting vomiting blood blood in the urine cramping muscles hair loss stomach pain and more convulsions The organs of the body that are usually affected by arsenic poisoning are the lungs skin kidneys and liver The final result of arsenic poisoning is coma and death Arsenic is related to heart disease hypertension related cardiovascular disease cancer stroke cerebrovascular diseases chronic lower respiratory diseases and diabetes Skin effects can include skin cancer in the long term but often prior to skin cancer are different skin lesions Other effects may include darkening of skin and thickening of skin Chronic exposure to arsenic is related to vitamin A deficiency which is related to heart disease and night blindness The acute minimal lethal dose of arsenic in adults is estimated to be 70 to 200 mg or 1 mg kg day
In populations where worm infections are widespread it is common to find that most people are infected by a small number of worms while a small number of people are heavily infected This is characteristic of many types of worm infections Those people who are infected with only a small number of worms usually have no symptoms
Half of all children and a quarter of previously healthy adults with Babesia infection are asymptomatic When people do develop symptoms the most common are fever and hemolytic anemia symptoms that are similar to those of malaria People with symptoms usually become ill 1 to 4 weeks after the bite or 1 to 9 weeks after transfusion of contaminated blood products A person infected with babesiosis gradually develops malaise and fatigue followed by a fever Hemolytic anemia in which red blood cells are destroyed and removed from the blood also develops Chills sweats and thrombocytopenia are also common symptoms Symptoms may last from several days to several months Less common symptoms and physical exam findings of mild to moderate babesiosis
The change from normal to premalignant cells indicate Barretts esophagus does not cause any particular symptoms Barretts esophagus however is associated with these symptoms
BPH is the most common cause of lower urinary tract symptoms LUTS which are divided into storage voiding and symptoms which occur after urination Storage symptoms include the need to urinate frequently waking at night to urinate urgency compelling need to void that cannot be deferred involuntary urination including involuntary urination at night or urge incontinence urine leak following a strong sudden need to urinate Voiding symptoms include urinary hesitancy a delay between trying to urinate and the flow actually beginning intermittency not continuous involuntary interruption of voiding weak urinary stream straining to void a sensation of incomplete emptying and uncontrollable leaking after the end of urination These symptoms may be accompanied by bladder pain or pain while urinating called dysuria Bladder outlet obstruction BOO can be caused by BPH Symptoms are abdominal pain a continuous feeling of a full bladder frequent urination acute urinary retention inability to urinate pain during urination dysuria problems starting urination urinary hesitancy slow urine flow starting and stopping urinary intermittency and nocturia BPH can be a progressive disease especially if left untreated Incomplete voiding results in residual urine or urinary stasis which can lead to an increased risk of urinary tract infection
Following an acute overdose of a benzodiazepine the onset of symptoms is typically rapid with most developing symptoms within 4 hours Patients initially present with mild to moderate impairment of central nervous system function Initial signs and symptoms include intoxication somnolence diplopia impaired balance impaired motor function anterograde amnesia ataxia and slurred speech Most patients with pure benzodiazepine overdose will usually only exhibit these mild CNS symptoms Paradoxical reactions such as anxiety delirium combativeness hallucinations and aggression can also occur following benzodiazepine overdose Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting have also been occasionally reported Cases of severe overdose have been reported and symptoms displayed might include prolonged deep coma or deep cyclic coma apnea respiratory depression hypoxemia hypothermia hypotension bradycardia cardiac arrest and pulmonary aspiration with the possibility of death Severe consequences are rare following overdose of benzodiazepines alone but the severity of overdose is increased significantly if benzodiazepines are taken in overdose in combination with other medications Significant toxicity may result following recreation drug misuse in conjunction with other CNS depressants such as opioids or alcohol The duration of symptoms following overdose is usually between 12 and 36 hours in the majority of cases The majority of drug related deaths involve misuse of heroin or other opioids in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressant drugs In most cases of fatal overdose it is likely that lack of opioid tolerance combined with the depressant effects of benzodiazepines is the cause of death The symptoms of an overdose such as sleepiness agitation and ataxia occur much more frequently and severely in children Hypotonia may also occur in severe cases
Symptoms of beriberi include weight loss emotional disturbances impaired sensory perception weakness and pain in the limbs and periods of irregular heart rate Edema swelling of bodily tissues is common It may increase the amount of lactic acid and pyruvic acid within the blood In advanced cases the disease may cause high output cardiac failure and death Symptoms may occur concurrently with those of Wernickes encephalopathy a primarily neurological thiamine deficiency related condition Beriberi is divided into four categories The first three are historical and the fourth gastrointestinal beriberi was recognized in 2004
Initially the symptoms of biliary atresia are indistinguishable from those of neonatal jaundice a usually harmless condition commonly seen in infants However infants with biliary atresia develop progressive conjugated jaundice pale white stools and dark urine Some infants fail to thrive as there will be a degree of fat and fat soluble vitamin malabsorption e g Vitamin K This may cause a bleeding tendency Eventually and usually after 2 months cirrhosis with portal hypertension will develop If left untreated biliary atresia can lead to liver failure Unlike other forms of jaundice however biliary atresia related cholestasis mostly does not result in kernicterus a form of brain damage resulting from liver dysfunction This is because in biliary atresia the liver although diseased is still able to conjugate bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin is unable to cross the blood brain barrier
Binge eating is the core symptom of BED however not everyone who binge eats has BED An individual may occasionally binge eat without experiencing many of the negative physical psychological or social effects of BED This may be considered disordered eating rather than a clinical disorder Precisely defining binge eating can be problematic however binge eating episodes in BED are generally described as having the following potential features
Symptoms may include pain in a specific bone with overlying redness fever and weakness and inability to walk especially in children with acute bacterial osteomyelitis Onset may be sudden or gradual Enlarged lymph nodes may be present In fungal osteomyelitis there is usually a history of walking bare footed especially in rural and farming areas Contrary to the mode of infection in bacterial osteomyelitis which is primarily blood borne fungal osteomyelitis starts as a skin infection then invades deeper tissues until it reaches bone
The muscle weakness of botulism characteristically starts in the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves a group of twelve nerves that control eye movements the facial muscles and the muscles controlling chewing and swallowing Double vision drooping of both eyelids loss of facial expression and swallowing problems may therefore occur In addition to affecting the voluntary muscles it can also cause disruptions in the autonomic nervous system This is experienced as a dry mouth and throat due to decreased production of saliva postural hypotension decreased blood pressure on standing with resultant lightheadedness and risk of blackouts and eventually constipation due to decreased forward movement of intestinal contents Some of the toxins B and E also precipitate nausea vomiting and difficulty with talking The weakness then spreads to the arms starting in the shoulders and proceeding to the forearms and legs again from the thighs down to the feet Severe botulism leads to reduced movement of the muscles of respiration and hence problems with gas exchange This may be experienced as dyspnea difficulty breathing but when severe can lead to respiratory failure due to the buildup of unexhaled carbon dioxide and its resultant depressant effect on the brain This may lead to respiratory compromise and death if untreated Clinicians frequently think of the symptoms of botulism in terms of a classic triad bulbar palsy and descending paralysis lack of fever and clear senses and mental status clear sensorium
The symptoms are like those associated with many other febrile diseases but with emphasis on muscular pain and night sweats The duration of the disease can vary from a few weeks to many months or even years In the first stage of the disease bacteremia occurs and leads to the classic triad of undulant fevers sweating often with characteristic foul moldy smell sometimes likened to wet hay and migratory arthralgia and myalgia joint and muscle pain Blood tests characteristically reveal a low number of white blood cells and red blood cells show some elevation of liver enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase and demonstrate positive Bengal rose and Huddleston reactions Gastrointestinal symptoms occur in 70 of cases and include nausea vomiting decreased appetite unintentional weight loss abdominal pain constipation diarrhea an enlarged liver liver inflammation liver abscess and an enlarged spleen This complex is at least in Portugal Israel Syria and Jordan known as Malta fever During episodes of Malta fever melitococcemia presence of brucellae in the blood can usually be demonstrated by means of blood culture in tryptose medium or Albini medium If untreated the disease can give origin to focalizations or become chronic The focalizations of brucellosis occur usually in bones and joints and osteomyelitis or spondylodiscitis of the lumbar spine accompanied by sacroiliitis is very characteristic of this disease Orchitis is also common in men The consequences of Brucella infection are highly variable and may include arthritis spondylitis thrombocytopenia meningitis uveitis optic neuritis endocarditis and various neurological disorders collectively known as neurobrucellosis
By definition BMS has no signs Sometimes affected persons will attribute the symptoms to sores in the mouth but these are in fact normal anatomic structures e g lingual papillae varices Symptoms of BMS are variable but the typical clinical picture is given below considered according to the Socrates pain assessment method see table If clinical signs are visible then another explanation for the burning sensation may be present Erythema redness and edema swelling of papillae on the tip of the tongue may be a sign that the tongue is being habitually pressed against the teeth The number and size of filiform papillae may be reduced If the tongue is very red and smooth then there is likely a local or systemic cause e g eythematous candidiasis anemia
Bursitis commonly affects superficial bursae These include the subacromial prepatellar retrocalcaneal and pes anserinus bursae of the shoulder knee heel and shin etc see below Symptoms vary from localized warmth and erythema to joint pain and stiffness to stinging pain that surrounds the joint around the inflamed bursa In this condition the pain usually is worse during and after activity and then the bursa and the surrounding joint becomes stiff the next morning Bursitis could possibly also cause a snapping grinding or popping sound known as snapping scapula syndrome when it occurs in the shoulder joint This is not necessarily painful
Signs and symptoms of CDI range from mild diarrhea to severe life threatening inflammation of the colon In adults a clinical prediction rule found the best signs to be significant diarrhea new onset of more than three partially formed or watery stools per 24 hour period recent antibiotic exposure abdominal pain fever up to 40 5 C or 105 F and a distinctive foul odor to the stool resembling horse manure In a hospital population prior antibiotic treatment plus diarrhea or abdominal pain had a sensitivity of 86 and a specificity of 45 In this study with a prevalence of positive cytotoxin assays of 14 the positive predictive value was 18 and the negative predictive value was 94 In children the most prevalent symptom of a CDI is watery diarrhea with at least three bowel movements a day for two or more days which may be accompanied by fever loss of appetite nausea and or abdominal pain Those with a severe infection also may develop serious inflammation of the colon and have little or no diarrhea
Most people who have taken too much of a calcium channel blocker especially diltiazem get slow heart rate and low blood pressure vasodilatory shock This can progress to the heart stopping altogether CCBs of the dihydropyridine group as well as flunarizine predominantly cause reflex tachycardia as a reaction to the low blood pressure Other potential symptoms include nausea and vomiting a decreased level of consciousness and breathing difficulties Symptoms usually begin within 6 hours of taking the medication by mouth With extended release formulations symptoms may not occur for up to a day Seizures are rare in adults but in children occur more often Hypocalcaemia may also occur
The prodromal symptoms are fever headache and myalgia which can be severe lasting as long as 24 hours After 1 5 days typically these are followed by diarrhea as many as 10 watery frequently bloody bowel movements per day or dysentery cramps abdominal pain and fever as high as 40 C 104 F In most people the illness lasts for 2 10 days It is classified as invasive inflammatory diarrhea also described as bloody diarrhea or dysentery There are other diseases showing similar symptoms For instance abdominal pain and tenderness may be very localized mimicking acute appendicitis Furthermore Helicobacter pylori is closely related to Campylobacter and causes peptic ulcer disease
Symptoms can range from mild to extreme often described as extreme flu like symptoms Many symptoms may be associated with fungemia including pain acute confusion chronic fatigue and infections Skin infections can include persistent or non healing wounds and lesions sweating itching and unusual discharge or drainage
The presentation of patient with SPCD can be incredibly varied from asymptomatic to lethal cardiac manifestations Early cases were reported with liver dysfunction muscular findings weakness and underdevelopment hypoketotic hypoglycemia cardiomegaly cardiomyopathy and marked carnitine deficiency in plasma and tissues combined with increased excretion in urine Patients who present clinically with SPCD fall into two categories a metabolic presentation with hypoglycemia and a cardiac presentation characterized by cardiomyopathy Muscle weakness can be found with either presentation In countries with expanded newborn screening SPCD can be identified shortly after birth Affected infants show low levels of free carnitine and all other acylcarnitine species by tandem mass spectrometry Not all infants with low free carnitine are affected with SPCD Some may have carnitine deficiency secondary to another metabolic condition or due to maternal carnitine deficiency Proper follow up of newborn screening results for low free carnitine includes studies of the mother to determine whether her carnitine deficiency is due to SPCD or secondary to a metabolic disease or diet Maternal cases of SPCD have been identified at a higher than expected rate often in women who are asymptomatic Some mothers have also been identified through newborn screening with cardiomyopathy that had not been previously diagnosed The identification and treatment of these asymptomatic individuals is still developing as it is not clear whether they require the same levels of intervention as patients identified with SPCD early in life based on clinical presentation
Cervicitis may have no symptoms If symptoms do manifest they may include
These are only local and no systemic manifestations are present The ulcer characteristically
The most common physical indications of cholangiocarcinoma are abnormal liver function tests jaundice yellowing of the eyes and skin occurring when bile ducts are blocked by tumor abdominal pain 30 50 generalized itching 66 weight loss 30 50 fever up to 20 and changes in the color of stool or urine To some extent the symptoms depend upon the location of the tumor people with cholangiocarcinoma in the extrahepatic bile ducts outside the liver are more likely to have jaundice while those with tumors of the bile ducts within the liver more often have pain without jaundice Blood tests of liver function in people with cholangiocarcinoma often reveal a so called obstructive picture with elevated bilirubin alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase levels and relatively normal transaminase levels Such laboratory findings suggest obstruction of the bile ducts rather than inflammation or infection of the liver parenchyma as the primary cause of the jaundice
The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear fluid These symptoms usually start suddenly half a day to five days after ingestion of the bacteria The diarrhea is frequently described as rice water in nature and may have a fishy odor An untreated person with cholera may produce 10 to 20 litres 3 to 5 US gal of diarrhea a day Severe cholera without treatment kills about half of affected individuals If the severe diarrhea is not treated it can result in life threatening dehydration and electrolyte imbalances Estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100 Cholera has been nicknamed the blue death because a persons skin may turn bluish gray from extreme loss of fluids Fever is rare and should raise suspicion for secondary infection Patients can be lethargic and might have sunken eyes dry mouth cold clammy skin or wrinkled hands and feet Kussmaul breathing a deep and labored breathing pattern can occur because of acidosis from stool bicarbonate losses and lactic acidosis associated with poor perfusion Blood pressure drops due to dehydration peripheral pulse is rapid and thready and urine output decreases with time Muscle cramping and weakness altered consciousness seizures or even coma due to electrolyte imbalances are common especially in children
increased quantitative chorionic gonadotropin the pregnancy hormone levels vaginal bleeding shortness of breath hemoptysis coughing up blood chest pain chest X ray shows multiple infiltrates of various shapes in both lungs presents in males as a testicular cancer sometimes with skin hyperpigmentation from excess chorionic gonadotropin cross reacting with the alpha MSH receptor gynecomastia and weight loss from excess chorionic gonadotropin cross reacting with the LH FSH and TSH receptor in males can present with decreased thyroid stimulating hormone TSH due to hyperthyroidism
The typical symptoms of a cold include cough runny nose sneezing nasal congestion and a sore throat sometimes accompanied by muscle ache fatigue headache and loss of appetite A sore throat is present in about 40 of cases a cough in about 50 and muscle ache likewise in about 50 In adults a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections The color of the mucus or nasal secretion may vary from clear to yellow to green and does not indicate the class of agent causing the infection
They may be found anywhere in the anal or genital area and are frequently found on external surfaces of the body including the penile shaft scrotum or labia majora of the vagina They can also occur on internal surfaces like the opening to the urethra inside the vagina on the cervix or in the anus They can be as small as 1 5mm in diameter but can also grow or spread into large masses in the genital or anal area In some cases they look like small stalks They may be hard keratinized or soft Their color can be variable and sometimes they may bleed In most cases there are no symptoms of HPV infection other than the warts themselves Sometimes warts may cause itching redness or discomfort especially when they occur around the anus Although they are usually without other physical symptoms an outbreak of genital warts may cause psychological distress such as anxiety in some people
Croup is characterized by a barking cough stridor hoarseness and difficult breathing which usually worsens at night The barking cough is often described as resembling the call of a sea lion The stridor is worsened by agitation or crying and if it can be heard at rest it may indicate critical narrowing of the airways As croup worsens stridor may decrease considerably Other symptoms include fever coryza symptoms typical of the common cold and indrawing of the chest wall known as Hoovers sign Drooling or a very sick appearance can indicate other medical conditions such as epiglottitis or tracheitis
The syndromes within CAPS overlap clinically and patients may have features of more than one disorder In a retrospective cohort of 136 CAPS patients with systemic involvement from 16 countries the most prevalent clinical features were fever 84 of cases often with concurrent constitutional symptoms such as fatigue malaise mood disorders or failure to thrive skin rash either urticarial or maculopapular rash 97 of cases especially after cold exposure and musculoskeletal involvement myalgia arthralgia and or arthritis or less commonly joint contracture patellar overgrowth bone deformity bone erosion and or osteolytic lesion 86 of cases Less common features included ophthalmological involvement conjunctivitis and or uveitis or less commonly optic nerve atrophy cataract glaucoma or impaired vision 71 of cases neurosensory hearing loss 42 of cases neurological involvement morning headache papilloedema and or meningitis or less commonly seizure hydrocephalus or mental retardation 40 of cases and AA amyloidosis 4 of cases In keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria systemic symptoms are not reported whereas the patients experience periodical transient inflammation of the corneal endothelium and stroma leading to short term blurring of vision and after repeated attacks to central corneal stromal opacities in some patients Age of onset is typically in infancy or early childhood In 57 of cases CAPS had a chronic phenotype with symptoms present almost daily whereas the remaining 43 of patients experienced only acute episodes Up to 56 of patients reported a family history of CAPS Previous studies confirm these symptoms although the exact reported rates vary
Symptoms include rapid weight gain particularly of the trunk and face with sparing of the limbs central obesity Common signs include the growth of fat pads along the collarbone on the back of the neck buffalo hump or lipodystrophy and on the face moon face Other symptoms include excess sweating dilation of capillaries thinning of the skin which causes easy bruising and dryness particularly the hands and mucous membranes purple or red striae the weight gain in Cushings syndrome stretches the skin which is thin and weakened causing it to hemorrhage on the trunk buttocks arms legs or breasts proximal muscle weakness hips shoulders and hirsutism facial male pattern hair growth baldness and or extremely dry and brittle hair In rare cases Cushings can cause hypocalcemia The excess cortisol may also affect other endocrine systems and cause for example insomnia inhibited aromatase reduced libido impotence in men and amenorrhoea oligomenorrhea and infertility in women due to elevations in androgens Studies have also shown that the resultant amenorrhea is due to hypercortisolism which feeds back onto the hypothalamus resulting in decreased levels of GnRH release Many of the features of Cushings are those seen in metabolic syndrome including insulin resistance hypertension obesity and elevated blood levels of triglycerides Cognitive conditions including memory and attention dysfunctions as well as depression are commonly associated with elevated cortisol and may be early indicators of exogenous or endogenous Cushings Depression and anxiety disorders are also common Other striking and distressing skin changes that may appear in Cushings syndrome include facial acne susceptibility to superficial fungus dermatophyte and malassezia infections and the characteristic purplish atrophic striae on the abdomen 500 Other signs include increased urination and accompanying increased thirst persistent high blood pressure due to cortisols enhancement of epinephrines vasoconstrictive effect and insulin resistance especially common with ACTH production outside the pituitary leading to high blood sugar and insulin resistance which can lead to diabetes mellitus Insulin resistance is accompanied by skin changes such as acanthosis nigricans in the axilla and around the neck as well as skin tags in the axilla Untreated Cushings syndrome can lead to heart disease and increased mortality Cortisol can also exhibit mineralocorticoid activity in high concentrations worsening the hypertension and leading to hypokalemia common in ectopic ACTH secretion and hypernatremia increased Na ions concentration in plasma Furthermore excessive cortisol may lead to gastrointestinal disturbances opportunistic infections and impaired wound healing related to cortisols suppression of the immune and inflammatory responses Osteoporosis is also an issue in Cushings syndrome since osteoblast activity is inhibited Additionally Cushings syndrome may cause sore and aching joints particularly in the hip shoulders and lower back Brain changes such as cerebral atrophy may occur This atrophy is associated with areas of high glucocorticoid receptor concentrations such as the hippocampus and correlates highly with psychopathological personality changes Rapid weight gain Moodiness irritability or depression Muscle and bone weakness Memory and attention dysfunction Osteoporosis Diabetes mellitus Hypertension Immune suppression Sleep disturbances Menstrual disorders such as amenorrhea in women Infertility in women Impotence in men Hirsutism Baldness Hypercholesterolemia
Acute exposure If hydrogen cyanide is inhaled it can cause a coma with seizures apnea and cardiac arrest with death following in a matter of seconds At lower doses loss of consciousness may be preceded by general weakness dizziness headaches vertigo confusion and perceived difficulty in breathing At the first stages of unconsciousness breathing is often sufficient or even rapid although the state of the person progresses towards a deep coma sometimes accompanied by pulmonary edema and finally cardiac arrest A cherry red skin color that darkens may be present as the result of increased venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation Despite the similar name cyanide does not directly cause cyanosis A fatal dose for humans can be as low as 1 5 mg kg body weight Other sources claim a lethal dose is 1 3 mg per kg body weight for vertebrates
Cystic fibrosis typically manifests early in life Newborns and infants with cystic fibrosis tend to have frequent large greasy stools a result of malabsorption and are underweight for their age 15 20 of newborns have their small intestine blocked by meconium often requiring surgery to correct Newborns occasionally have neonatal jaundice due to blockage of the bile ducts Children with cystic fibrosis lose excessive salt in their sweat and parents often notice salt crystallizing on the skin or a salty taste when they kiss their child The primary cause of morbidity and death in people with cystic fibrosis is progressive lung disease which eventually leads to respiratory failure This typically begins as a prolonged respiratory infection that continues until treated with antibiotics Chronic infection of the respiratory tract is nearly universal in people with cystic fibrosis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa fungi and mycobacteria all increasingly common over time Inflammation of the upper airway results in frequent runny nose and nasal obstruction Nasal polyps are common particularly in children and teenagers As the disease progresses people tend to have shortness of breath and a chronic cough that produces sputum Breathing problems make it increasingly challenging to exercise and prolonged illness causes those affected to be underweight for their age In late adolescence or adulthood people begin to develop severe signs of lung disease wheezing digital clubbing cyanosis coughing up blood pulmonary heart disease and collapsed lung atelectasis or pneumothorax In rare cases cystic fibrosis can manifest itself as a coagulation disorder Vitamin K is normally absorbed from breast milk formula and later solid foods This absorption is impaired in some CF patients Young children are especially sensitive to vitamin K malabsorptive disorders because only a very small amount of vitamin K crosses the placenta leaving the child with very low reserves and limited ability to absorb vitamin K from dietary sources after birth Because clotting factors II VII IX and X are vitamin K dependent low levels of vitamin K can result in coagulation problems Consequently when a child presents with unexplained bruising a coagulation evaluation may be warranted to determine whether an underlying disease is present
Muscles Cysticerci can develop in any voluntary muscle Invasion of muscle can cause inflammation of the muscle with fever eosinophilia and increased size which initiates with muscle swelling and later progress to atrophy and scarring In most cases it is asymptomatic since the cysticerci die and become calcified
Infection causes acute non bloody diarrhea with crampy abdominal pain which can last for weeks and result in malabsorption and weight loss In immunodepressed patients and in infants and children the diarrhea can be severe Eosinophilia may be present differently from other protozoan infections
The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are the following Chronic nausea Vomiting especially of undigested food Abdominal pain A feeling of fullness after eating just a few bitesOther symptoms include the following
Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by intensely itchy chronic papulovesicular eruptions usually distributed symmetrically on extensor surfaces buttocks back of neck scalp elbows knees back hairline groin or face 616 The blisters vary in size from very small up to 1 cm across The condition is extremely itchy and the desire to scratch may be overwhelming This sometimes causes the affected person to scratch the blisters off before they are examined by a physician Intense itching or burning sensations are sometimes felt before the blisters appear in a particular area The signs and symptoms of DH typically appear around 30 to 40 years of age although all ages may be affected Although the first signs and symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis are intense itching and burning the first visible signs are the small papules or vesicles that usually look like red bumps or blisters The rash rarely occurs on other mucous membranes excepting the mouth or lips The symptoms range in severity from mild to serious but they are likely to disappear if gluten ingestion is avoided and appropriate treatment is administered Dermatitis herpetiformis symptoms are chronic and they tend to come and go mostly in short periods of time in response to the amount of gluten ingested Sometimes these symptoms may be accompanied by symptoms of coeliac disease which typically include abdominal pain bloating or loose stool weight loss and fatigue However individuals with DH often have no gastrointestinal symptoms even if they have associated intestinal damage The rash caused by dermatitis herpetiformis forms and disappears in three stages In the first stage the patient may notice a slight discoloration of the skin at the site where the lesions appear In the next stage the skin lesions transform into obvious vesicles and papules that are likely to occur in groups Healing of the lesions is the last stage of the development of the symptoms usually characterized by a change in the skin color This may result in areas of the skin turning darker or lighter than the color of the skin on the rest of the body Because of the intense itching patients usually scratch which may lead to the formation of crusts
Type 1 diabetes begins suddenly typically in childhood or adolescence The major sign of type 1 diabetes is very high blood sugar which typically manifests in children as a few days to weeks of polyuria increased urination polydipsia increased thirst and weight loss Children may also experience increased appetite blurred vision bedwetting recurrent skin infections candidiasis of the perineum irritability and performance issues at school Adults with type 1 diabetes tend to have more varied symptoms that come on over months rather than days to weeks Prolonged lack of insulin can also result in diabetic ketoacidosis characterized by persistent fatigue dry or flushed skin abdominal pain nausea or vomiting confusion trouble breathing and a fruity breath odor Blood and urine tests reveal unusually high glucose and ketones in the blood and urine Untreated ketoacidosis can rapidly progress to loss of consciousness coma and death The percentage of children whose type 1 diabetes begins with an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis varies widely by geography as low as 15 in parts of Europe and North America and as high as 80 in the developing world
The classic symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination polyuria increased thirst polydipsia increased hunger polyphagia and weight loss Other symptoms that are commonly present at diagnosis include a history of blurred vision itchiness peripheral neuropathy recurrent vaginal infections and fatigue Other symptoms may include loss of taste Many people however have no symptoms during the first few years and are diagnosed on routine testing A small number of people with type 2 diabetes can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and low blood pressure
Digoxin toxicity is often divided into acute or chronic toxicity In both of these toxicity cardiac effects are of the greatest concern With an acute ingestion symptoms such as nausea vertigo and vomiting are prominent On the other hand nonspecific symptoms are predominant in chronic toxicity These symptoms include fatigue malaise and visual disturbances The classic features of digoxin toxicity are nausea vomiting abdominal pain headache dizziness confusion delirium vision disturbance blurred or yellow vision It is also associated with cardiac disturbances including irregular heartbeat ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation sinoatrial block and AV block
Morphology of lesions Discoid lupus erythematosus DLE skin lesions first present as dull or purplish red disc shaped flat or raised and firm areas of skin These lesions then develop increasing amounts of white adherent scale Finally the lesions develop extensive scarring and or atrophy as well as pigment changes They may also have overlying dried fluid known as crust On darker skin the lesions often lose skin pigmentation in the center and develop increased dark skin pigmentation around the rim On lighter skin the lesions often develop a gray color or have very little color change More rarely the lesions may be bright red and look like hives
Typical symptoms of dry eye syndrome are dryness burning and a sandy gritty eye irritation that gets worse as the day goes on Symptoms may also be described as itchy stinging or tired eyes Other symptoms are pain redness a pulling sensation and pressure behind the eye There may be a feeling that something such as a speck of dirt is in the eye The resultant damage to the eyes surface increases discomfort and sensitivity to bright light Both eyes usually are affected There may also be a stringy discharge from the eyes Although it may seem contradictory dry eye can cause the eyes to water due to irritation One may experience excessive tearing such as if something got into the eye These reflex tears will not necessarily make the eyes feel better since they are the watery tears that are produced in response to injury irritation or emotion which lack the lubricating qualities necessary to prevent dry eye Because blinking coats the eye with tears symptoms are worsened by activities in which the rate of blinking is reduced due to prolonged use of the eyes These activities include prolonged reading computer usage computer vision syndrome driving or watching television Symptoms increase in windy dusty or smoky including cigarette smoke areas in dry environments high altitudes including airplanes on days with low humidity and in areas where an air conditioner especially in a car fan heater or even a hair dryer is being used Symptoms reduce during cool rainy or foggy weather and in humid places such as in the shower Most people who have dry eyes experience mild irritation with no long term effects However if the condition is left untreated or becomes severe it can produce complications that can cause eye damage resulting in impaired vision or rarely in the loss of vision Symptom assessment is a key component of dry eye diagnosis to the extent that many believe dry eye syndrome to be a symptom based disease Several questionnaires have been developed to determine a score that would allow for a diagnosis The McMonnies Ho dry eye questionnaire is often used in clinical studies of dry eyes
DMD causes progressive muscle weakness due to muscle fiber disarray death and replacement with connective tissue or fat The voluntary muscles are affected first especially those of the hips pelvic area thighs calves It eventually progresses to the shoulders and neck followed by arms respiratory muscles and other areas Fatigue is common Signs usually appear before age five and may even be observed from the moment a boy takes his first steps There is general difficulty with motor skills which can result in an awkward manner of walking stepping or running They tend to walk on their toes in part due to shortening of the Achilles tendon and because it compensates for knee extensor weakness Falls can be frequent It becomes harder and harder for the boy to walk his ability to walk usually completely disintegrates before age 13 Most men affected with DMD become essentially paralyzed from the neck down by the age of 21 Cardiomyopathy particularly dilated cardiomyopathy is common seen in half of 18 year olds The development of congestive heart failure or arrhythmia irregular heartbeat is only occasional In late stages of the disease respiratory impairment and swallowing impairment can occur which can result in pneumonia
Typically Dupuytrens contracture first presents as a thickening or nodule in the palm which initially can be with or without pain Later in the disease process which can be years later there is painless increasing loss of range of motion of the affected finger s The earliest sign of a contracture is a triangular puckering of the skin of the palm as it passes over the flexor tendon just before the flexor crease of the finger at the metacarpophalangeal MCP joint Generally the cords or contractures are painless but rarely tenosynovitis can occur and produce pain The most common finger to be affected is the ring finger the thumb and index finger are much less often affected The disease begins in the palm and moves towards the fingers with the metacarpophalangeal MCP joints affected before the proximal interphalangeal PIP joints The MCP joints at the base of the finger responds much better to treatment and are usually able to fully extend after treatment Due to anatomic differences in the ligaments and extensor tendons at the PIP joints they may have some residual flexion Proper patient education is necessary to set realistic treatment expectation In Dupuytrens contracture the palmar fascia within the hand becomes abnormally thick which can cause the fingers to curl and can impair finger function The main function of the palmar fascia is to increase grip strength thus over time Dupuytrens contracture decreases a persons ability to hold objects and use the hand in many different activities Dupuytrens contracture can also be experienced as embarrassing in social situations and can affect quality of life People may report pain aching and itching with the contractions Normally the palmar fascia consists of collagen type I but in Dupuytren patients the collagen changes to collagen type III which is significantly thicker than collagen type I
Specific symptoms include fever chills severe headaches muscle aches nausea vomiting diarrhea loss of appetite confusion and a splotchy or pinpoint rash More severe symptoms include brain or nervous system damage respiratory failure uncontrollable bleeding organ failure and death Ehrlichiosis can also blunt the immune system by suppressing production of TNF alpha which may lead to opportunistic infections such as candidiasis Most of the signs and symptoms of ehrlichiosis can likely be ascribed to the immune dysregulation that it causes A toxic shock like syndrome is seen in some severe cases of ehrlichiosis Some cases can present with purpura and in one such case the organisms were present in such overwhelming numbers that in 1991 Dr Aileen Marty of the AFIP was able to demonstrate the bacteria in human tissues using standard stains and later proved that the organisms were indeed Ehrlichia using immunoperoxidase stains Experiments in mouse models further support this hypothesis as mice lacking TNF alpha I II receptors are resistant to liver injury caused by Ehrlichia infection About 3 of human monocytic ehrlichiosis cases result in death however these deaths occur most commonly in immunosuppressed individuals who develop respiratory distress syndrome hepatitis or opportunistic nosocomial infections
Pain and infertility are common symptoms although 20 25 of women are asymptomatic Presence of pain symptoms are associated with the type of endometrial lesions as 50 of women with typical lesions 10 of women with cystic ovarian lesions and 5 of women with deep endometriosis do not have pain
There is usually a history of recent eye surgery or penetrating trauma to the eye Symptoms include severe pain vision loss and intense redness of the conjunctiva Hypopyon can be present and should be looked for on examination by a slit lamp It can first present with the black dot sign Martin Farina sign where patients may report a small area of loss of vision that resembles a black dot or fly An eye exam should be considered in systemic candidiasis as up to 3 of cases of candidal blood infections lead to endophthalmitis
Those aged 15 to 35 are most commonly affected The acute form usually develops over the course of several days with pain and swelling frequently in only one testis which will hang low in the scrotum There will often be a recent history of dysuria or urethral discharge Fever is also a common symptom In the chronic version the patient may have painful point tenderness but may or may not have an irregular epididymis upon palpation though palpation may reveal an indurated epididymis A scrotal ultrasound may reveal problems with the epididymis but such an ultrasound may also show nothing unusual The majority of patients who present with chronic epididymitis have had symptoms for over five years p 311
The symptoms of esophagitis include Heartburn a burning sensation in the lower mid chest Nausea Dysphagia swallowing is painful with difficulty passing or inability to pass food through the esophagus Vomiting emesis Abdominal pain Cough
Symptoms often occur suddenly Affected individuals may develop a fever shivering chills fatigue headaches vomiting and be generally unwell within 48 hours of the initial infection The red plaque enlarges rapidly and has a sharply demarcated raised edge It may appear swollen feel firm warm and tender to touch and may have a consistency similar to orange peel Pain may be extreme More severe infections can result in vesicles pox or insect bite like marks blisters and petechiae small purple or red spots with possible skin necrosis death Lymph nodes may be swollen and lymphedema may occur Occasionally a red streak extending to the lymph node can be seen The infection may occur on any part of the skin including the face arms fingers legs and toes it tends to favour the extremities The umbilical stump and sites of lymphoedema are also common sites affected Fat tissue and facial areas typically around the eyes ears and cheeks are most susceptible to infection Repeated infection of the extremities can lead to chronic swelling lymphoedema
Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion Symptoms usually follow a three step progression although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage Stage 1 30 minutes to 12 hours consists of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning Poisoned individuals may appear to be intoxicated dizzy lacking coordination of muscle movements drooling depressed and have slurred speech seizures abnormal eye movements headaches and confusion Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting Also seen are excessive thirst and urination Over time the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins Stage 2 12 to 36 hours where signs of alcohol poisoning appear to resolve underlying severe internal damage is still occurring An elevated heart rate hyperventilation or increased breathing effort and dehydration may start to develop along with high blood pressure and metabolic acidosis These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood overactive muscle reflexes muscle spasms QT interval prolongation and congestive heart failure may occur If untreated death most commonly occurs during this period Stage 3 24 to 72 hours kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning In cats this stage occurs 12 24 hours after consuming antifreeze in dogs at 36 72 hours after consuming antifreeze During this stage severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys Severe lethargy coma depression vomiting seizures drooling and inappetence may be seen Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis red blood cells in the urine excess proteins in the urine lower back pain decreased or absent production of urine elevated blood concentration of potassium and acute kidney failure If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns
Ewing sarcoma is more common in males 1 6 male 1 female and usually presents in childhood or early adulthood with a peak between 10 and 20 years of age It can occur anywhere in the body but most commonly in the pelvis and proximal long tubular bones especially around the growth plates The diaphyses of the femur are the most common sites followed by the tibia and the humerus Thirty percent are overtly metastatic at presentation while 10 15 of people present with a pathologic fracture at the time of diagnosis People usually experience extreme bone pain Rarely it can develop in the vagina Signs and symptoms include intermittent fevers anemia leukocytosis increased sedimentation rate and other symptoms of inflammatory systemic illness According to the Bone Cancer Research Trust BCRT the most common symptoms are localized pain swelling and sporadic bone pain with variable intensity The swelling is most likely to be visible if the sarcoma is located on a bone near the surface of the body but when it occurs in other places deeper in the body like on the pelvis it may not be visible
Loss of pancreatic enzymes leads to maldigestion and malabsorption which may in turn lead to anemia Vitamin B12 iron folate deficiency bleeding disorders Vitamin K malabsorption edema hypoalbuminemia fatigue flatulence and abdominal distention bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed food hypocalcemia metabolic bone disease Vitamin D deficiency neurologic manifestation steatorrhea weight loss
Symptoms are similar to dry eye Patients may complain redness irritation ocular discomfort burning and foreign body sensation Punctate epithelial defects epithelial break down and stromal melting may be seen in corneal examination Corneal ulceration may develop due to bacterial invasion
Failure to thrive is most commonly diagnosed before two years of age when growth rates are highest though FTT can present among children and adolescents of any age Caretakers may express concern about poor weight gain or smaller size compared to peers of a similar age Physicians often identify failure to thrive during routine office visits when a childs growth parameters such as height and weight are not increasing appropriately on growth curves Other signs and symptoms may vary widely depending on the etiology of FTT It is also important to differentiate stunting from wasting as they can indicate different causes of FTT Wasting refers to a deceleration in stature more than 2 standard deviations from median weight for height whereas stunting is a drop of more than 2 standard deviations from the median height for age The characteristic pattern seen with children with inadequate nutritional intake is an initial deceleration in weight gain followed several weeks to months later by a deceleration in stature and finally a deceleration in head circumference Inadequate caloric intake could be caused by lack of access to food or caretakers may notice picky eating habits low appetite or food refusal FTT caused by malnutrition could also yield physical findings that indicate potential vitamin and mineral deficiencies such as scaling skin spoon shaped nails cheilosis or neuropathy Lack of food intake by a child could also be due to psychosocial factors related to the child or family It is vital to screen patients and their caretakers for psychiatric conditions such as depression or anxiety as well as screen children for signs and symptoms of child abuse neglect or emotional deprivation Children who have FTT caused by a genetic or medical problem may have differences in growth patterns compared to children with FTT due to inadequate food intake A decrease in length with a proportional drop in weight can be related to long standing nutritional factors as well as genetic or endocrine causes Head circumference as well can be an indicator for the etiology of FTT If head circumference is affected initially in addition to weight or length other factors are more likely causes than inadequate intake Some of these include intrauterine infection teratogens and some congenital syndromes Children who have a medical condition causing FTT may have additional signs and symptoms specific to their condition Fetal alcohol syndrome FAS has been associated with FTT and can present with characteristic findings including microcephaly short palpebral fissures a smooth philtrum and a thin vermillion border Disorders that cause difficulties absorbing or digesting nutrients such as Crohns disease cystic fibrosis or celiac disease can present with abdominal symptoms Symptoms can include abdominal pain abdominal distention hyperactive bowel sounds bloody stools or diarrhea
Attacks There are seven types of attacks Ninety percent of all patients have their first attack before they are 18 years old All develop over 2 4 hours and last anywhere from 6 hours to 5 days Most attacks involve fever Abdominal attacks featuring abdominal pain affect the whole abdomen with all signs of peritonitis inflammation of abdominal lining and acute abdominal pain like appendicitis They occur in 95 of all patients and may lead to unnecessary laparotomy Incomplete attacks with local tenderness and normal blood tests have been reported Joint attacks mainly occur in large joints especially in the legs Usually only one joint is affected 75 of all FMF patients experience joint attacks Chest attacks include pleuritis inflammation of the pleura and pericarditis inflammation of the pericardium Pleuritis occurs in 40 of patients and makes it difficult to breathe or lie flat but pericarditis is rare Scrotal attacks due to inflammation of the tunica vaginalis are somewhat rare but may be mistaken for testicular torsion Myalgia rare in isolation Erysipeloid rashes a skin reaction on the legs that can mimic cellulitis rare in isolation
Humans The course of fasciolosis in humans has 4 main phases Incubation phase from the ingestion of metacercariae to the appearance of the first symptoms time period few days to 3 months depends on number of ingested metacercariae and immune status of host Invasive or acute phase fluke migration up to the bile ducts This phase is a result of mechanical destruction of the hepatic tissue and the peritoneum by migrating juvenile flukes causing localized and or generalized toxic and allergic reactions The major symptoms of this phase are Fever usually the first symptom of the disease 40 42 C 104 108 F Abdominal pain Gastrointestinal disturbances loss of appetite flatulence nausea diarrhea Urticaria Respiratory symptoms very rare cough dyspnoea chest pain hemoptysis Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly Ascites Anaemia Jaundice Latent phase This phase can last for months or years The proportion of asymptomatic subjects in this phase is unknown They are often discovered during family screening after a patient is diagnosed Chronic or obstructive phase This phase may develop months or years after initial infection Adult flukes in the bile ducts cause inflammation and hyperplasia of the epithelium The resulting cholangitis and cholecystitis combined with the large body of the flukes are sufficient to cause mechanical obstruction of the biliary duct In this phase biliary colic epigastric pain fatty food intolerance nausea jaundice pruritus right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness etc are clinical manifestations indistinguishable from cholangitis cholecystitis and cholelithiasis of other origins Hepatic enlargement may be associated with an enlarged spleen or ascites In case of obstruction the gall bladder is usually enlarged and edematous with thickening of the wall Ref Hepatobiliary Fascioliasis Sonographic and CT Findings in 87 Patients During the InitialPhase and Long Term Follow Up Adnan Kabaalioglu Kagan Ceken Emel Alimoglu Rabin Saba Metin Cubuk Gokhan Arslan Ali Apaydin AJR 2007 189 824 828 Fibrous adhesions of the gall bladder to adjacent organs are common Lithiasis of the bile duct or gall bladder is frequent and the stones are usually small and multiple
Food allergy symptoms occur within minutes to hours after exposure and may include Rash Hives Itching of mouth lips tongue throat eyes skin or other areas Swelling angioedema of lips tongue eyelids or the whole face Difficulty swallowing Runny or congested nose Hoarse voice Wheezing and or shortness of breath Diarrhea abdominal pain and or stomach cramps Lightheadedness Fainting Nausea VomitingIn some cases however onset of symptoms may be delayed for hours Symptoms can vary The amount of food needed to trigger a reaction also varies Serious danger regarding allergies can begin when the respiratory tract or blood circulation is affected The former can be indicated through wheezing and cyanosis Poor blood circulation leads to a weak pulse pale skin and fainting A severe case of an allergic reaction caused by symptoms affecting the respiratory tract and blood circulation is called anaphylaxis When symptoms are related to a drop in blood pressure the person is said to be in anaphylactic shock Anaphylaxis occurs when IgE antibodies are involved and areas of the body that are not in direct contact with the food become affected and show symptoms Those with asthma or an allergy to peanuts tree nuts or seafood are at greater risk for anaphylaxis
Symptoms vary from none to severe diarrhea with poor absorption of nutrients The cause of this wide range in severity of symptoms is not fully known but the intestinal flora of the infected host may play a role Diarrhea is less likely to occur in people from developing countries Symptoms typically develop 9 15 days after exposure but may occur as early as one day The most common and prominent symptom is chronic diarrhea which can occur for weeks or months if untreated Diarrhea is often greasy and foul smelling with a tendency to float This characteristic diarrhea is often accompanied by a number of other symptoms including gas abdominal cramps and nausea or vomiting Some people also experience symptoms outside of the gastrointestinal tract such as itchy skin hives and swelling of the eyes and joints although these are less common Fever occurs in only about 15 of people in spite of the nickname beaver fever Prolonged disease is often characterized by diarrhea along with malabsorption of nutrients in the intestine This malabsorption results in fatty stools substantial weight loss and fatigue Additionally those with giardiasis often have difficulty absorbing lactose vitamin A folate and vitamin B12 In children prolonged giardiasis can cause failure to thrive and may impair mental development Symptomatic infections are well recognized as causing lactose intolerance which while usually temporary may become permanent
The symptoms of gingivitis are somewhat non specific and manifest in the gum tissue as the classic signs of inflammation
Common symptoms include seizures headaches nausea and vomiting memory loss changes to personality mood or concentration and localized neurological problems The kind of symptoms produced depends more on the location of the tumor than on its pathological properties The tumor can start producing symptoms quickly but occasionally is an asymptomatic condition until it reaches an enormous size
Aside from the visible rash granuloma annulare is usually asymptomatic Sometimes the rash may burn or itch People with GA usually notice a ring of small firm bumps papules over the backs of the forearms hands or feet often centered on joints or knuckles The bumps are caused by the clustering of T cells below the skin These papules start as very small pimple looking bumps which spread over time from that size to dime quarter half dollar size and beyond Occasionally multiple rings may join into one Rarely GA may appear as a firm nodule under the skin of the arms or legs It also occurs on the sides and circumferential at the waist and without therapy can continue to be present for many years Outbreaks continue to develop at the edges of the aging rings
Up to 90 of people infected with H pylori never experience symptoms or complications However individuals infected with H pylori have a 10 to 20 lifetime risk of developing peptic ulcers Acute infection may appear as an acute gastritis with abdominal pain stomach ache or nausea Where this develops into chronic gastritis the symptoms if present are often those of non ulcer dyspepsia Stomach pains nausea bloating belching and sometimes vomiting Pain typically occurs when the stomach is empty between meals and in the early morning hours but it can also occur at other times Less common ulcer symptoms include nausea vomiting and loss of appetite Bleeding in the stomach can also occur as evidenced by the passage of black stools prolonged bleeding may cause anemia leading to weakness and fatigue If bleeding is heavy hematemesis hematochezia or melena may occur Inflammation of the pyloric antrum which connects the stomach to the duodenum is more likely to lead to duodenal ulcers while inflammation of the corpus i e body of the stomach is more likely to lead to gastric ulcers Individuals infected with H pylori may also develop colorectal or gastric polyps i e non cancerous growths of tissue projecting from the mucous membranes of these organs Usually these polyps are asymptomatic but gastric polyps may be the cause of dyspepsia heartburn bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract and rarely gastric outlet obstruction while colorectal polyps may be the cause of rectal bleeding anemia constipation diarrhea weight loss and abdominal pain Individuals with chronic H pylori infection have an increased risk of acquiring a cancer that is directly related to this infection These cancers are stomach adenocarcinoma less commonly diffuse large B cell lymphoma of the stomach or extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphomas of the stomach or more rarely of the colon rectum esophagus or ocular adenexa i e orbit conjunctiva and or eyelids The signs symptoms pathophysiology and diagnoses of these cancers are given in the cited linkages
In about 40 of people with pathological hemorrhoids there are no significant symptoms Internal and external hemorrhoids may present differently however many people may have a combination of the two Bleeding enough to cause anemia is rare and life threatening bleeding is even more uncommon Many people feel embarrassed when facing the problem and often seek medical care only when the case is advanced
Heparin may be used for both prevention and the treatment of thrombosis It exists in two main forms an unfractionated form that can be injected under the skin subcutaneously or through an intravenous infusion and a low molecular weight form that is generally given subcutaneously Commonly used low molecular weight heparins are enoxaparin dalteparin nadroparin and tinzaparin In HIT the platelet count in the blood falls below the normal range a condition called thrombocytopenia However it is generally not low enough to lead to an increased risk of bleeding Most people with HIT therefore do not experience any symptoms Typically the platelet count falls 5 14 days after heparin is first given if someone has received heparin in the previous three months the fall in platelet count may occur sooner sometimes within a day The most common symptom of HIT is enlargement or extension of a previously diagnosed blood clot or the development of a new blood clot elsewhere in the body This may take the form of clots either in arteries or veins causing arterial or venous thrombosis respectively Examples of arterial thrombosis are stroke myocardial infarction heart attack and acute leg ischemia Venous thrombosis may occur in the leg or arm in the form of deep vein thrombosis DVT and in the lung in the form of a pulmonary embolism PE the latter usually originates in the leg but migrates to the lung In those receiving heparin through an intravenous infusion a complex of symptoms systemic reaction may occur when the infusion is started These include fever chills high blood pressure a fast heart rate shortness of breath and chest pain This happens in about a quarter of people with HIT Others may develop a skin rash consisting of red spots
Telangiectasias Telangiectasia small vascular malformations may occur in the skin and mucosal linings of the nose and gastrointestinal tract The most common problem is nosebleeds epistaxis which happen frequently from childhood and affect about 90 95 of people with HHT Lesions on the skin and in the mouth bleed less often but may be considered cosmetically displeasing they affect about 80 The skin lesions characteristically occur on the lips the nose and the fingers and on the skin of the face in sun exposed areas They appear suddenly with the number increasing over time About 20 are affected by symptomatic digestive tract lesions although a higher percentage have lesions that do not cause symptoms These lesions may bleed intermittently which is rarely significant enough to be noticed in the form of bloody vomiting or black stool but can eventually lead to depletion of iron in the body resulting in iron deficiency anemia
Patients typically present with excessive orotic acid in the urine failure to thrive developmental delay and megaloblastic anemia which cannot be cured by administration of vitamin B12 or folic acid
Herpes infections usually show no symptoms when symptoms do appear they typically resolve within two weeks The main symptom of oral infection is inflammation of the mucosa of the cheek and gums known as acute herpetic gingivostomatitis which occurs within 5 10 days of infection Other symptoms may also develop including headache nausea dizziness and painful ulcers sometimes confused with canker sores fever and sore throat Primary HSV infection in adolescents frequently manifests as severe pharyngitis with lesions developing on the cheek and gums Some individuals develop difficulty in swallowing dysphagia and swollen lymph nodes lymphadenopathy Primary HSV infections in adults often results in pharyngitis similar to that observed in glandular fever infectious mononucleosis but gingivostomatitis is less likely Recurrent oral infection is more common with HSV 1 infections than with HSV 2 Symptoms typically progress in a series of eight stages
No symptoms or signs are specific for hookworm infection but they give rise to a combination of intestinal inflammation and progressive iron deficiency anemia and protein deficiency Coughing chest pain wheezing and fever sometimes result from severe infection Epigastric pains indigestion nausea vomiting constipation and diarrhea can occur early or in later stages as well although gastrointestinal symptoms tend to improve with time Signs of advanced severe infection are those of anemia and protein deficiency including emaciation cardiac failure and abdominal distension with ascites Larval invasion of the skin mostly in the Americas can produce a skin disease called cutaneous larva migrans also known as creeping eruption The hosts of these worms are not human and the larvae can only penetrate the upper five layers of the skin where they give rise to intense local itching usually on the foot or lower leg known as ground itch This infection is due to larvae from the A braziliense hookworm The larvae migrate in tortuous tunnels between the stratum basale and stratum corneum of the skin causing serpiginous vesicular lesions With advancing movement of the larvae the rear portions of the lesions become dry and crusty The lesions are typically intensely itchy
Molar pregnancies usually present with painless vaginal bleeding in the fourth to fifth months of pregnancy The uterus may be larger than expected or the ovaries may be enlarged There may also be more vomiting than would be expected hyperemesis Sometimes there is an increase in blood pressure along with protein in the urine Blood tests will show very high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin hCG
It can be asymptomatic but these symptoms may be present Fatigue Headache High blood pressure Hypokalemia Hypernatraemia Hypomagnesemia Intermittent or temporary paralysis Muscle spasms Muscle weakness Numbness Polyuria Polydipsia Tingling Metabolic alkalosis Nocturia Blurry Vision Dizziness Vertigo
Vasomotor Presentations of low estrogen levels include hot flashes which are sudden intense feelings of heat predominantly in the upper body causing the skin to redden as if blushing They are believed to occur due to the narrowing of the thermonuclear zone in the hypothalamus making the body more sensitive to body temperature changes Night disturbances are also common symptoms associated with hypoestrogenism People may experience difficulty falling asleep waking up several times a night and early awakening with different variability between races and ethnic groups
There is a remarkable variety of symptoms that depends largely on the age of the patient at initial presentation ranging from death in utero to relatively mild bone problems with or without dentition symptoms in adult life although neurological and extra skeletal symptoms are also reported The stages of this disease are generally included in the following categories perinatal infantile childhood adult benign prenatal and odontohypophosphatasia Although several clinical sub types of the disease have been characterized based on the age at which skeletal lesions are discovered the disease is best understood as a single continuous spectrum of severity As the presentation of adult disease is highly variable incorrect or missed diagnosis may occur In one study 19 of patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia had laboratory findings suggestive of possible hypophosphatasia One case report details a 35 year old female with low serum ALP and mild pains but no history of rickets fractures or dental problems Subsequent evaluation showed osteopenia and renal microcalcifications and an elevation of PEA The genetic mutations found in this case were previously reported in perinatal infantile and childhood hypophosphatasia but not adult hypophosphatasia
There are various symptoms that are presented and are typically associated to a specific site that they appear at Hypoprothrombinemia is characterized by a poor blood clotting function of prothrombin Some symptoms are presented as severe while others are mild meaning that blood clotting is slower than normal Areas that are usually affected are muscles joints and the brain however these sites are more uncommon The most common symptoms include
Symptoms of hair loss include hair loss in patches usually in circular patterns dandruff skin lesions and scarring Alopecia areata mild medium level usually shows in unusual hair loss areas e g eyebrows backside of the head or above the ears areas the male pattern baldness usually does not affect In male pattern hair loss loss and thinning begin at the temples and the crown and hair either thins out or falls out Female pattern hair loss occurs at the frontal and parietal People have between 100 000 and 150 000 hairs on their head The number of strands normally lost in a day varies but on average is 100 In order to maintain a normal volume hair must be replaced at the same rate at which it is lost The first signs of hair thinning that people will often notice are more hairs than usual left in the hairbrush after brushing or in the basin after shampooing Styling can also reveal areas of thinning such as a wider parting or a thinning crown
Signs include the spontaneous formation of bruises purpura and petechiae tiny bruises especially on the extremities bleeding from the nostrils and or gums and menorrhagia excessive menstrual bleeding any of which may occur if the platelet count is below 20 000 per μl A very low count 10 000 per μl may result in the spontaneous formation of hematomas blood masses in the mouth or on other mucous membranes Bleeding time from minor lacerations or abrasions is usually prolonged Serious and possibly fatal complications due to extremely low counts 5 000 per μl include subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage bleeding inside the skull or brain lower gastrointestinal bleeding or other internal bleeding An ITP patient with an extremely low count is vulnerable to internal bleeding caused by blunt abdominal trauma as might be experienced in a motor vehicle crash These complications are not likely when the platelet count is above 20 000 per μl
Contagious impetigo This most common form of impetigo also called nonbullous impetigo most often begins as a red sore near the nose or mouth which soon breaks leaking pus or fluid and forms a honey colored scab followed by a red mark which often heals without leaving a scar Sores are not painful but they may be itchy Lymph nodes in the affected area may be swollen but fever is rare Touching or scratching the sores may easily spread the infection to other parts of the body Skin ulcers with redness and scarring also may result from scratching or abrading the skin
Infantile hemangiomas typically develop in the first few weeks or months of life They are more common in Caucasians in premature children whose birth weight is less than 3 pounds 1 4 kg in females and in twin births Early lesions may resemble a red scratch or patch a white patch or a bruise The majority occurs on the head and neck but they can occur almost anywhere The appearance and color of the IH depends on its location and depth within the level of the skin Superficial IHs are situated higher in the skin and have a bright red erythematous to reddish purple appearance Superficial lesions can be flat and telangiectatic composed of a macule or patch of small varied branching capillary blood vessels They can also be raised and elevated from the skin forming papules and confluent bright red plaques like raised islands Infantile hemangiomas have historically been referred to strawberry marks or strawberry hemangiomas in the past as raised superficial hemangiomas can look like the side of a strawberry without seeds and this remains a common lay term Superficial IHs in certain locations such as the posterior scalp neck folds and groin perianal areas are at potential risk of ulceration Ulcerated hemangiomas can present as black crusted papules or plaques or painful erosions or ulcers Ulcerations are prone to secondary bacterial infections which can present with yellow crusting drainage pain or odor Ulcerations are also at risk for bleeding particularly deep lesions or in areas of friction Multiple superficial hemangiomas more than five can be associated with extracutaneous hemangiomas the most common being a liver hepatic hemangioma and these infants warrant ultrasound examination Deep IHs present as poorly defined bluish macules that can proliferate into papules nodules or larger tumors Proliferating lesions are often compressible but fairly firm Many deep hemangiomas may have a few superficial capillaries visible evident over the primary deep component or surrounding venous prominence Deep hemangiomas have a tendency to develop a little later than superficial hemangiomas and may have longer and later proliferative phases as well Deep hemangiomas rarely ulcerate but can cause issues depending on their location size and growth Deep hemangiomas near sensitive structures can cause compression of softer surrounding structures during the proliferative phase such as the external ear canal and the eyelid Mixed hemangiomas are simply a combination of superficial and deep hemangiomas and may not be evident for several months Patients may have any combination of superficial deep or mixed IHs IHs are often classified as focal localized segmental or indeterminate Focal IHs appear localized to a specific location and appear to arise from a solitary spot Segmental hemangiomas are larger and appear to encompass a region of the body Larger or segmental hemangiomas that span a large area can sometimes have underlying anomalies that may require investigation especially when located on the face sacrum or pelvis Unless ulceration occurs an IH does not tend to bleed and is not painful Discomfort may arise if it is bulky and blocks a vital orifice
One of the hallmarks of arterial claudication is that it occurs intermittently It disappears after a very brief rest and the patient can start walking again until the pain recurs The following signs are general signs of atherosclerosis of the lower extremity arteries cyanosis atrophic changes like loss of hair shiny skin decreased temperature decreased pulse redness when limb is returned to a dependent position part of Buergers test The six P s of ischemia Pain Pallor increased Pulse decreased Perishing cold Paraesthesia Paralysis
The most common symptoms of IC BPS are suprapubic pain urinary frequency painful sexual intercourse and waking up from sleep to urinate In general symptoms may include painful urination described as a burning sensation in the urethra during urination pelvic pain that is worsened with the consumption of certain foods or drinks urinary urgency and pressure in the bladder or pelvis Other frequently described symptoms are urinary hesitancy needing to wait for the urinary stream to begin often caused by pelvic floor dysfunction and tension and discomfort and difficulty driving working exercising or traveling Pelvic pain experienced by those with IC typically worsens with filling of the urinary bladder and may improve with urination During cystoscopy 5 10 of people with IC are found to have Hunners ulcers A person with IC may have discomfort only in the urethra while another might struggle with pain in the entire pelvis Interstitial cystitis symptoms usually fall into one of two patterns significant suprapubic pain with little frequency or a lesser amount of suprapubic pain but with increased urinary frequency
Manifestation of iron poisoning may vary depending on the amount of iron ingested by the individual and is further classified by five stages based on timing of signs and symptoms In mild to moderate cases individuals may be asymptomatic or only experience mild gastrointestinal symptoms that resolve within six hours In serious cases individuals may present with systemic signs and symptoms and require treatment Clinical presentation of iron poisoning in the absence of treatment progresses in five stages the gastrointestinal phase latent phase metabolic acidosis and shock phase hepatotoxicity phase and bowel obstruction due to scarring The first indication of iron poisoning occurs within the first six hours post ingestion and involves gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting with or without blood Due to the disintegration of iron tablets the stool may appear as black or dark green or gray After the first stage gastrointestinal symptoms appear to resolve in the latent phase and individuals may show signs of improvement Following this stage the iron begins to affect the cells of the bodys organs which manifests as numerous systemic signs and symptoms developing after 6 to 72 hours in the metabolic acidosis phase Individuals may present with signs of cardiogenic shock indicated by low blood pressure rapid heart rate and severe shortness of breath Hypovolemic shock occurs due to loss of blood from the gastrointestinal bleeding caused by the iron During this phase metabolic acidosis may also develop damaging internal organs such as the brain and liver In the fourth stage taking place 12 to 96 hours after ingestion liver toxicity and failure occurs as the cells begin to die In the last stage of iron poisoning following 2 to 8 weeks after ingestion scarring of the gastrointestinal mucosal lining resulting in bowel obstruction
There are three principle seizures types which may occur in JME myoclonus generalized tonic clonic seizures and absence seizures Approximately one third of patients have all three seizure types The majority of patients 58 2 have frequent myoclonic jerks and uncommon generalized tonic clonic seizures Absence seizures are believed to be the least common with studies estimating a prevalence of 10 to as high as 38 Myoclonic status epilepticus may occur as a complication but it is uncommon Patient s typically initially present to medical providers following their first generalized tonic clonic seizure It is often subsequently reported that the patient was having myoclonus for several years prior The first generalized tonic clonic seizure usually occurs in the context of a particular provoking factor such as sleep deprivation stress or alcohol consumption There are other potential provoking factors such as praxis induction which refers to the precipitation of seizures or epileptiform discharges in the context of a complex cognitive tasks Patients with JME tend to perform worse on neuropsychological assessments in multiple cognitive domains and are also more likely to have psychiatric comorbidities such as depression and anxiety when compared to control populations The majority of patients with JME report satisfaction with their health work friendships and social life
KS lesions are nodules or blotches that may be red purple brown or black and are usually papular They are typically found on the skin but spread elsewhere is common especially the mouth gastrointestinal tract and respiratory tract Growth can range from very slow to explosively fast and is associated with significant mortality and morbidity The lesions are painless but become cosmetically disfiguring or interruptive to organs
Keloids expand in claw like growths over normal skin They have the capability to hurt with a needle like pain or to itch the degree of sensation varying from person to person Keloids form within scar tissue Collagen used in wound repair tends to overgrow in this area sometimes producing a lump many times larger than that of the original scar They can also range in color from pink to red Although they usually occur at the site of an injury keloids can also arise spontaneously They can occur at the site of a piercing and even from something as simple as a pimple or scratch They can occur as a result of severe acne or chickenpox scarring infection at a wound site repeated trauma to an area excessive skin tension during wound closure or a foreign body in a wound Keloids can sometimes be sensitive to chlorine If a keloid appears when someone is still growing the keloid can continue to grow as well
People with early keratoconus often notice a minor blurring or distortion of their vision as well as an increased sensitivity to light and visit their clinician seeking corrective lenses for reading or driving At early stages the symptoms of keratoconus may be no different from those of any other refractive defect of the eye As the disease progresses vision deteriorates sometimes rapidly due to irregular astigmatism Visual acuity becomes impaired at all distances and night vision is often poor Some individuals have vision in one eye that is markedly worse than the other eye The disease is often bilateral though asymmetrical Some develop photophobia sensitivity to bright light eye strain from squinting in order to read or itching in the eye but there is normally little or no sensation of pain It may cause luminous objects to appear as cylindrical pipes with the same intensity at all points
The most prominent sign of labour is strong repetitive uterine contractions Pain in contractions has been described as feeling similar to very strong menstrual cramps Women giving birth are often encouraged to refrain from screaming However moaning and grunting may be encouraged to help lessen pain Crowning may be experienced as an intense stretching and burning Back labour is a term for specific pain occurring in the lower back just above the tailbone during childbirth Another prominent sign of labour is the rupture of membranes commonly known as water breaking This is the leaking of fluid from the amniotic sac that surrounds a fetus in the uterus and helps provide cushion and thermoregulation However it is common for water to break long before contractions begin and in which case it is not a sign of immediate labor and hospitalization is generally required for monitoring the fetus and prevention of preterm birth
The weakness from LEMS typically involves the muscles of the proximal arms and legs the muscles closer to the trunk In contrast to myasthenia gravis the weakness affects the legs more than the arms This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise High temperatures can worsen the symptoms Weakness of the bulbar muscles muscles of the mouth and throat is occasionally encountered Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon Some may have double vision drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing but generally only together with leg weakness this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis in which eye signs are much more common In the advanced stages of the disease weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur Some may also experience problems with coordination ataxia Three quarters of people with LEMS also have disruption of the autonomic nervous system This may be experienced as a dry mouth constipation blurred vision impaired sweating and orthostatic hypotension falls in blood pressure on standing potentially leading to blackouts Some report a metallic taste in the mouth On neurological examination the weakness demonstrated with normal testing of power is often less severe than would be expected on the basis of the symptoms Strength improves further with repeated testing e g improvement of power on repeated hand grip a phenomenon known as Lamberts sign At rest reflexes are typically reduced with muscle use reflex strength increases This is a characteristic feature of LEMS The pupillary light reflex may be sluggish In LEMS associated with lung cancer most have no suggestive symptoms of cancer at the time such as cough coughing blood and unintentional weight loss LEMS associated with lung cancer may be more severe
Lead poisoning can cause a variety of symptoms and signs which vary depending on the individual and the duration of lead exposure Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle and someone with elevated lead levels may have no symptoms Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure but acute symptoms from brief intense exposures also occur Symptoms from exposure to organic lead which is probably more toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility occur rapidly Poisoning by organic lead compounds has symptoms predominantly in the central nervous system such as insomnia delirium cognitive deficits tremor hallucinations and convulsions Symptoms may be different in adults and children the main symptoms in adults are headache abdominal pain memory loss kidney failure male reproductive problems and weakness pain or tingling in the extremities Early symptoms of lead poisoning in adults are commonly nonspecific and include depression loss of appetite intermittent abdominal pain nausea diarrhea constipation and muscle pain Other early signs in adults include malaise fatigue decreased libido and problems with sleep An unusual taste in the mouth and personality changes are also early signs In adults symptoms can occur at levels above 40 μg dL but are more likely to occur only above 50 60 μg dL Symptoms begin to appear in children generally at around 60 μg dL However the lead levels at which symptoms appear vary widely depending on unknown characteristics of each individual At blood lead levels between 25 and 60 μg dL neuropsychiatric effects such as delayed reaction times irritability and difficulty concentrating as well as slowed motor nerve conduction and headache can occur Anemia may appear at blood lead levels higher than 50 μg dL In adults abdominal colic involving paroxysms of pain may appear at blood lead levels greater than 80 μg dL Signs that occur in adults at blood lead levels exceeding 100 μg dL include wrist drop and foot drop and signs of encephalopathy a condition characterized by brain swelling such as those that accompany increased pressure within the skull delirium coma seizures and headache In children signs of encephalopathy such as bizarre behavior discoordination and apathy occur at lead levels exceeding 70 μg dL For both adults and children it is rare to be asymptomatic if blood lead levels exceed 100 μg dL
The symptoms of leishmaniasis are skin sores which erupt weeks to months after the person is bitten by infected sand flies Leishmaniasis may be divided into the following types Cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most common form which causes an open sore at the bite sites which heals in a few months to a year and half leaving an unpleasant looking scar Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis produces widespread skin lesions which resemble leprosy and may not heal on its own Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis causes both skin and mucosal ulcers with damage primarily of the nose and mouth Visceral leishmaniasis or kala azar black fever is the most serious form and is generally fatal if untreated Other consequences which can occur a few months to years after infection include fever damage to the spleen and liver and anemia Leishmaniasis is considered one of the classic causes of a markedly enlarged and therefore palpable spleen the organ which is not normally felt during examination of the abdomen may even become larger than the liver in severe cases
Common symptoms present in the different types of leprosy include a runny nose dry scalp eye problems skin lesions muscle weakness reddish skin smooth shiny diffuse thickening of facial skin ear and hand loss of sensation in fingers and toes thickening of peripheral nerves a flat nose from destruction of nasal cartilage and changes in phonation and other aspects of speech production In addition atrophy of the testes and impotence may occur Leprosy can affect people in different ways The average incubation period is five years People may begin to notice symptoms within the first year or up to 20 years after infection The first noticeable sign of leprosy is often the development of pale or pink coloured patches of skin that may be insensitive to temperature or pain Patches of discolored skin are sometimes accompanied or preceded by nerve problems including numbness or tenderness in the hands or feet Secondary infections additional bacterial or viral infections can result in tissue loss causing fingers and toes to become shortened and deformed as cartilage is absorbed into the body A persons immune response differs depending on the form of leprosy Approximately 30 of people affected with leprosy experience nerve damage The nerve damage sustained is reversible when treated early but becomes permanent when appropriate treatment is delayed by several months Damage to nerves may cause loss of muscle function leading to paralysis It may also lead to sensation abnormalities or numbness which may lead to additional infections ulcerations and joint deformities
The clinical manifestation of LGV depends on the site of entry of the infectious organism the sex contact site and the stage of disease progression Inoculation at the mucous lining of external sex organs penis and vagina can lead to the inguinal syndrome named after the formation of buboes or abscesses in the groin inguinal region where draining lymph nodes are located These signs usually appear from 3 days to a month after exposure The rectal syndrome lymphogranuloma venereum proctitis or LGVP arises if the infection takes place via the rectal mucosa through anal sex and is mainly characterized by proctocolitis or proctitis symptoms The pharyngeal syndrome is rare It starts after infection of pharyngeal tissue and buboes in the neck region can occur
Infants may present with feeding difficulties with frequent vomiting diarrhea swelling of the abdomen and failure to gain weight or sometimes weight loss As the disease progresses in infants increasing fat accumulation in the liver leads to other complications including yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes jaundice and a persistent low grade fever An ultrasound examination shows accumulation of chalky material calcification in the adrenal gland in about half of infants with LAL D Complications of LAL D progress over time eventually leading to life threatening problems such as extremely low levels of circulating red blood cells severe anemia liver dysfunction or failure and physical wasting cachexia People who are older children or adults generally present with a wide range of signs and symptoms that overlap with other disorders They may have diarrhoea stomach pain vomiting or poor growth a sign of malabsorption They may have signs of bile duct problems like itchiness jaundice pale stool or dark urine Their feces may be excessively greasy They often have an enlarged liver liver disease and may have yellowish deposits of fat underneath the skin usually around their eyelids The disease is often undiagnosed in adults The person may have a history of premature cardiac disease or premature stroke
Adults with malaria tend to experience chills and fever classically in periodic intense bouts lasting around six hours followed by a period of sweating and fever relief as well as headache fatigue abdominal discomfort and muscle pain Children tend to have more general symptoms fever cough vomiting and diarrhea Initial manifestations of the disease common to all malaria species are similar to flu like symptoms and can resemble other conditions such as sepsis gastroenteritis and viral diseases The presentation may include headache fever shivering joint pain vomiting hemolytic anemia jaundice hemoglobin in the urine retinal damage and convulsions The classic symptom of malaria is paroxysm a cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by shivering and then fever and sweating occurring every two days tertian fever in P vivax and P ovale infections and every three days quartan fever for P malariae P falciparum infection can cause recurrent fever every 36 48 hours or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever Symptoms typically begin 10 15 days after the initial mosquito bite but can occur as late as several months after infection with some P vivax strains Travellers taking preventative malaria medications may develop symptoms once they stop taking the drugs Severe malaria is usually caused by P falciparum often referred to as falciparum malaria Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9 30 days after infection Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit neurological symptoms including abnormal posturing nystagmus conjugate gaze palsy failure of the eyes to turn together in the same direction opisthotonus seizures or coma
Pattern hair loss is classified as a form of non scarring hair loss Male pattern hair loss begins above the temples and at the vertex calvaria of the scalp As it progresses a rim of hair at the sides and rear of the head remains This has been referred to as a Hippocratic wreath and rarely progresses to complete baldness Female pattern hair loss more often causes diffuse thinning without hairline recession similar to its male counterpart female androgenic alopecia rarely leads to total hair loss The Ludwig scale grades severity of female pattern hair loss These include Grades 1 2 3 of balding in women based on their scalp showing in the front due to thinning of hair In most cases receding hairline is the first starting point the hairline starts moving backwards from the front of the head and the sides
The typical signs of malignant hyperthermia are due to a hypercatabolic state which presents as a very high temperature an increased heart rate and abnormally rapid breathing increased carbon dioxide production increased oxygen consumption mixed acidosis rigid muscles and rhabdomyolysis These signs can develop any time during the administration of the anesthetic triggering agents Rarely signs may develop up to 40 minutes after the end of anaesthesia
Common symptoms of mercury poisoning include peripheral neuropathy presenting as paresthesia or itching burning pain or even a sensation that resembles small insects crawling on or under the skin formication skin discoloration pink cheeks fingertips and toes swelling and desquamation shedding or peeling of skin Mercury irreversibly inhibits selenium dependent enzymes see below and may also inactivate S adenosyl methionine which is necessary for catecholamine catabolism by catechol O methyl transferase Due to the bodys inability to degrade catecholamines e g adrenaline a person with mercury poisoning may experience profuse sweating tachycardia persistently faster than normal heart beat increased salivation and hypertension high blood pressure Affected children may show red cheeks nose and lips loss of hair teeth and nails transient rashes hypotonia muscle weakness and increased sensitivity to light Other symptoms may include kidney dysfunction e g Fanconi syndrome or neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional lability memory impairment or insomnia Thus the clinical presentation may resemble pheochromocytoma or Kawasaki disease Desquamation skin peeling can occur with severe mercury poisoning acquired by handling elemental mercury
Lungs Symptoms or signs of mesothelioma may not appear until 20 to 50 years or more after exposure to asbestos Shortness of breath cough and pain in the chest due to an accumulation of fluid in the pleural space pleural effusion are often symptoms of pleural mesothelioma Mesothelioma that affects the pleura can cause these signs and symptoms Chest wall pain Pleural effusion or fluid surrounding the lung Shortness of breath which could be due to a collapsed lung Fatigue or anemia Wheezing hoarseness or a cough Blood in the sputum fluid coughed up hemoptysis In severe cases the person may have many tumor masses The individual may develop a pneumothorax or collapse of the lung The disease may metastasize or spread to other parts of the body
The initial symptoms of methanol intoxication include central nervous system depression headache dizziness nausea lack of coordination and confusion Sufficiently large doses cause unconsciousness and death The initial symptoms of methanol exposure are usually less severe than the symptoms from the ingestion of a similar quantity of ethanol Once the initial symptoms have passed a second set of symptoms arises from 10 to as many as 30 hours after the initial exposure that may include blurring or complete loss of vision acidosis and putaminal hemorrhages an uncommon but serious complication These symptoms result from the accumulation of toxic levels of formate in the blood and may progress to death by respiratory failure Physical examination may show tachypnea and eye examination may show dilated pupils with hyperemia of the optic disc and retinal edema
HIDS is one of a number of periodic fever syndromes It is characterised by attacks of fever arthralgia skin lesions including cyclical mouth ulcers and diarrhea Laboratory features include an acute phase response elevated CRP and ESR and markedly elevated IgD and often IgA although cases with normal IgD have been described It has mainly been described in the Netherlands and France although the international registry includes a number of cases from other countries The differential diagnosis includes fever of unknown origin familial Mediterranean fever FMF and familial Hibernian fever or TNFα reception associated periodic syndrome TRAPS
Clinical features may include constitutional symptoms like fever loss of appetite weight loss fatigue and kidney failure A majority of patients may have blood in the urine and protein in the urine Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis may occur Because many different organ systems may be involved a wide range of symptoms are possible in MPA Purpura and livedo racemosa may be present
Signs of a miscarriage include vaginal spotting abdominal pain cramping and fluid blood clots and tissue passing from the vagina Bleeding can be a symptom of miscarriage but many women also have bleeding in early pregnancy and do not miscarry Bleeding during the first half of pregnancy may be referred to as a threatened miscarriage Of those who seek treatment for bleeding during pregnancy about half will miscarry Miscarriage may be detected during an ultrasound exam or through serial human chorionic gonadotropin HCG testing
Children with Hurler syndrome may appear normal at birth and develop symptoms over the first years of life Symptoms vary between patients One of the first abnormalities that may be detected is coarsening of the facial features these symptoms can begin at 3 6 months of age The head can be large with prominent frontal bones The skull can be elongated The nose can have a flattened nasal bridge with continuous nasal discharge The eye sockets may be widely spaced and the eyes may protrude from the skull The lips can be large and affected children may hold their jaws open constantly Skeletal abnormalities occur by about age 6 months but may not be clinically obvious until 10 14 months Patients may experience debilitating spine and hip deformities carpal tunnel syndrome and joint stiffness Patients may be normal height in infancy but stop growing by the age of 2 years They may not reach a height of greater than 4 feet Other early symptoms may include inguinal and umbilical hernias These may be present at birth or they may develop within the first months of life Clouding of the cornea and retinal degeneration may occur within the first year of life leading to blindness Enlarged liver and spleen are common There is no organ dysfunction but GAG deposition in these organs may lead to a massive increase in size Patients may also have diarrhea Aortic valve disease may occur Airway obstruction is frequent usually secondary to abnormal cervical vertebrae Upper and lower respiratory tract infections can be frequent Developmental delay may become apparent by age 1 2 years with a maximum functional age of 2 4 years Progressive deterioration follows Most children develop limited language capabilities Death usually occurs by age 10
Hunter syndrome may present with a wide variety of phenotypes It has traditionally been categorized as either mild or severe depending on the presence of central nervous system symptoms but this is an oversimplification Patients with attenuated or mild forms of the disease may still have significant health issues For severely affected patients the clinical course is relatively predictable patients will normally die at an early age For those with milder forms of the disease a wider variety of outcomes exist Many live into their 20s and 30s but some may have near normal life expectancies Cardiac and respiratory abnormalities are the usual cause of death for patients with milder forms of the disease The symptoms of Hunter syndrome MPS II are generally not apparent at birth Often the first symptoms may include abdominal hernias ear infections runny noses and colds As the buildup of GAGs continues throughout the cells of the body signs of MPS II become more visible Physical appearances of many children with the syndrome include a distinctive coarseness in their facial features including a prominent forehead a nose with a flattened bridge and an enlarged tongue They may also have a large head as well as an enlarged abdomen For severe cases of MPS II a diagnosis is often made between the ages of 18 and 36 months In milder cases patients present similarly to children with Hurler Scheie syndrome and a diagnosis is usually made between the ages of 4 and 8 years The continued storage of GAGs leads to abnormalities in multiple organ systems After 18 months children with severe MPS II may experience developmental decline and progressive loss of skills The thickening of the heart valves and walls of the heart can result in progressive decline in cardiac function The walls of the airway may become thickened as well leading to obstructive airway disease As the liver and spleen grow larger with time the abdomen may become distended making hernias more noticeable All major joints may be affected by MPS II leading to joint stiffness and limited motion Progressive involvement of the finger and thumb joints results in decreased ability to pick up small objects The effects on other joints such as hips and knees can make walking normally increasingly difficult If carpal tunnel syndrome develops a further decrease in hand function can occur The bones themselves may be affected resulting in short stature In addition pebbly ivory colored skin lesions may be found on the upper arms legs and upper back of some people with it These skin lesions are considered pathognomic for the disease Finally the storage of GAGs in the brain can lead to delayed development with subsequent intellectual disability and progressive loss of function The age at onset of symptoms and the presence or absence of behavioral disturbances are predictive factors of ultimate disease severity in very young patients Behavioral disturbances can often mimic combinations of symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder autism obsessive compulsive disorder and or sensory processing disorder although the existence and level of symptoms differ in each affected child They often also include a lack of an appropriate sense of danger and aggression The behavioral symptoms of MPS II generally precede neurodegeneration and often increase in severity until the mental handicaps become more pronounced By the time of death most children with severe MPS II have severe mental disabilities and are completely dependent on their caretakers
Unlike other MPS diseases children with Maroteaux Lamy syndrome usually have normal intelligence They share many of the physical symptoms found in Hurler syndrome Maroteaux Lamy syndrome has a variable spectrum of severe symptoms Neurological complications include clouded corneas deafness thickening of the dura the membrane that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord and pain caused by compressed or traumatized nerves and nerve roots Signs are revealed early in the affected childs life with one of the first symptoms often being a significantly prolonged age of learning how to walk Growth begins normally but children usually stop growing by age 8 By age 10 children often develop a shortened trunk crouched stance and restricted joint movement In more severe cases children also develop a protruding abdomen and forward curving spine Skeletal changes particularly in the pelvis are progressive and limit movement Many children also have umbilical hernia or inguinal hernias Nearly all children have some form of heart disease usually involving the heart valves
The most severe cases of Sly syndrome can result in hydrops fetalis which results in fetal death or death soon after birth Some people with Sly syndrome may begin to have symptoms in early childhood Symptoms can include an enlarged head fluid buildup in the brain coarse facial features enlarged tongue enlarged liver enlarged spleen problems with the heart valves and abdominal hernias People with Sly syndrome may also suffer from sleep apnea frequent lung infections and problems with vision secondary to cloudy corneas Sly syndrome causes various musculoskeletal abnormalities that worsen with age These can include short stature joint deformities dysostosis multiplex spinal stenosis and carpal tunnel syndrome While some individuals have developmental delay others may have normal intelligence However the accumulation of GAGs in the brain usually leads to the slowing of development from ages 1 3 and then a loss of previously learned skills until death
Signs and symptoms of mucormycosis depend on the location in the body of the infection Infection usually begins in the mouth or nose and enters the central nervous system via the eyes If the fungal infection begins in the nose or sinus and extends to brain symptoms and signs may include one sided eye pain or headache and may be accompanied by pain in the face numbness fever loss of smell a blocked nose or runny nose The person may appear to have sinusitis The face may look swollen on one side with rapidly progressing black lesions across the nose or upper inside of mouth One eye may look swollen and bulging and vision may be blurred Fever cough chest pain and difficulty breathing or coughing up blood can occur when the lungs are involved A stomach ache nausea vomiting and bleeding can occur when the gastrointestinal tract is involved Affected skin may appear as a dusky reddish tender patch with a darkening centre due to tissue death There may be an ulcer and it can be very painful Invasion of the blood vessels can result in thrombosis and subsequent death of surrounding tissue due to a loss of blood supply Widespread disseminated mucormycosis typically occurs in people who are already sick from other medical conditions so it can be difficult to know which symptoms are related to mucormycosis People with disseminated infection in the brain can develop changes in mental status or lapse into a coma
NL NLD most frequently appears on the patients shins often on both legs although it may also occur on forearms hands trunk and rarely nipple penis and surgical sites The lesions are often asymptomatic but may become tender and ulcerate when injured The first symptom of NL is often a bruised appearance erythema that is not necessarily associated with a known injury The extent to which NL is inherited is unknown NLD appears as a hardened raised area of the skin The center of the affected area usually has a yellowish tint while the area surrounding it is a dark pink It is possible for the affected area to spread or turn into an open sore When this happens the patient is at greater risk of developing ulcers If an injury to the skin occurs on the affected area it may not heal properly or it will leave a dark scar
Drug and alcohol use during pregnancy can lead to many health problems in the fetus and infants including neonatal abstinence syndrome NAS The onset of clinical presentation typically appears within 48 to 72 hours of birth but may take up to 8 days The signs and symptoms of NAS may be different depending on which substance the mother used Common signs and symptoms in infants with NAS may include Signs due to hyperactivity of the central nervous system Tremors trembling Irritability excessive mood crying Sleep problems High pitched crying Muscle tightness Hyperactive reflexes Seizures 2 to 11 notably this clinical sign is controversial given it does not occur in other populations experiencing opioid withdrawal Signs due to hyperactivity of stomach and intestines Poor feeding and sucking reflex Vomiting Diarrhea Signs due to hyperactivity of autonomous nervous system Fever Sweating Yawning stuffy nose and sneezing Fast breathing
Neurogenic bladder can cause a range of urinary symptoms including urinary urgency urinary incontinence or difficulty urinating urinary retention The first sign of bladder dysfunction may be recurrent urinary tract infections UTIs
The signs and symptoms of neurosyphilis vary with the disease stage of syphilis The stages of syphilis are categorized as primary secondary latent and tertiary It is important to note that neurosyphilis may occur at any stage of infection Meningitis is the most common neurological presentation in early syphilis It typically occurs in the secondary stage arising within one year of initial infection The symptoms are similar to other forms of meningitis The most common associated with neurosyphilitic meningitis is cranial nerve palsy especially of the facial nerve Nearly any part of the eye may be involved The most common form of ocular syphilis is uveitis Other forms include episcleritis vitritis retinitis papillitis retinal detachment and interstitial keratitis Meningovascular syphilis usually occurs in late syphilis but may affect those with early disease It is due to inflammation of the vasculature supplying the central nervous system that results in ischemia It typically occurs about 6 7 years after initial infection and it may affect those with early disease It may present as stroke or spinal cord infarct Signs and symptoms vary with vascular territory involved The middle cerebral artery is most often affected Parenchymal syphilis occurs years to decades after initial infection It presents with the constellation of symptoms known as tabes dorsalis because of a degenerative process of the posterior columns of the spinal cord The constellation includes Argyll Robertson pupil ataxic wide based gait paresthesias bowel or bladder incontinence loss of position and vibratory sense loss of deep pain and temperature sensation acute episodic gastrointestinal pain Charcot joints and general paresis Gummatous disease may also present with destructive inflammation and space occupying lesions It is caused by granulomatous destruction of visceral organs They most often involve the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain Movement disorders can be found in a small percentage of individuals with neurosyphilis The abnormal movements already reported were tremor chorea parkinsonism ataxia myoclonus dystonia athetosis and ballism
Those with nightmares experience abnormal sleep architecture The impact of having a nightmare during the night has been found to be very similar to that of insomnia This is thought to be caused by frequent nocturnal awakenings and fear of falling asleep Nightmare disorder symptoms include repeated awakenings from the major sleep period or naps with detailed recall of extended and extremely frightening dreams usually involving threats to survival security or self esteem The awakenings generally occur during the second half of the sleep period
Adult worms remain in subcutaneous nodules limiting access to the hosts immune system Microfilariae in contrast are able to induce intense inflammatory responses especially upon their death Wolbachia species have been found to be endosymbionts of O volvulus adults and microfilariae and are thought to be the driving force behind most of O volvulus morbidity Dying microfilariae have been recently discovered to release Wolbachia surface protein that activates TLR2 and TLR4 triggering innate immune responses and producing the inflammation and its associated morbidity The severity of illness is directly proportional to the number of infected microfilariae and the power of the resultant inflammatory response Skin involvement typically consists of intense itching swelling and inflammation A grading system has been developed to categorize the degree of skin involvement Acute papular onchodermatitis scattered pruritic papules Chronic papular onchodermatitis larger papules resulting in hyperpigmentation Lichenified onchodermatitis hyperpigmented papules and plaques with edema lymphadenopathy pruritus and common secondary bacterial infections Skin atrophy loss of elasticity the skin resembles tissue paper lizard skin appearance Depigmentation leopard skin appearance usually on anterior lower leg Glaucoma effect eyes malfunction begin to see shadows or nothingOcular involvement provides the common name associated with onchocerciasis river blindness and may involve any part of the eye from conjunctiva and cornea to uvea and posterior segment including the retina and optic nerve The microfilariae migrate to the surface of the cornea Punctate keratitis occurs in the infected area This clears up as the inflammation subsides However if the infection is chronic sclerosing keratitis can occur making the affected area become opaque Over time the entire cornea may become opaque thus leading to blindness Some evidence suggests the effect on the cornea is caused by an immune response to bacteria present in the worms The infected persons skin is itchy with severe rashes permanently damaging patches of skin
The most common symptom of a fungal nail infection is the nail becoming thickened and discoloured white black yellow or green As the infection progresses the nail can become brittle with pieces breaking off or coming away from the toe or finger completely If left untreated the skin underneath and around the nail can become inflamed and painful There may also be white or yellow patches on the nailbed or scaly skin next to the nail and a foul smell There is usually no pain or other bodily symptoms unless the disease is severe People with onychomycosis may experience significant psychosocial problems due to the appearance of the nail particularly when fingers which are always visible rather than toenails are affected Dermatophytids are fungus free skin lesions that sometimes form as a result of a fungus infection in another part of the body This could take the form of a rash or itch in an area of the body that is not infected with the fungus Dermatophytids can be thought of as an allergic reaction to the fungus
Neonatal conjunctivitis by definition presents during the first month of life Signs and symptoms include Pain and tenderness in the eyeball Conjunctival discharge purulent mucoid or mucopurulent depending on the cause Conjunctival hyperaemia and chemosis usually also with swelling of the eyelids Corneal involvement rare may occur in herpes simplex ophthalmia neonatorum
Orthopedic The main symptom of osteogenesis imperfecta is fragile low mineral density bones all types of OI have some bone involvement In moderate and especially severe OI the long bones may be bowed sometimes extremely so The weakness of the bones causes them to fracture easily a study in Pakistan found an average of 5 8 fractures per year in untreated children Fractures typically occur much less after puberty but begin to increase again in women after menopause and in men between the ages of 60 and 80 486 Joint hypermobility is also a common sign of OI thought to be because the affected genes are the same as those that cause some types of Ehlers Danlos syndrome 1513
Despite this excess bone formation people with osteopetrosis tend to have bones that are more brittle than normal Mild osteopetrosis may cause no symptoms and present no problems
Tenderness of pinna is the predominant complaint and the only symptom directly related to the severity of acute external otitis Unlike other forms of ear infections we observe tenderness in outer ear i e the pain of acute external otitis is worsened when the outer ear is touched or pulled gently Pushing the tragus the tablike portion of the auricle that projects out just in front of the ear canal opening also typically causes pain in this condition as to be diagnostic of external otitis on physical examination People may also experience ear discharge and itchiness When enough swelling and discharge in the ear canal is present to block the opening external otitis may cause temporary conductive hearing loss Because the symptoms of external otitis lead many people to attempt to clean out the ear canal or scratch it with slim implements self cleaning attempts generally lead to additional traumas of the injured skin so rapid worsening of the condition often occurs
Symptoms are set into 3 categories mild moderate and severe Mild symptoms include abdominal bloating and feeling of fullness nausea diarrhea and slight weight gain Moderate symptoms include excessive weight gain weight gain of greater than 2 pounds per day increased abdominal girth vomiting diarrhea darker urine decreased urine output excessive thirst and skin and or hair feeling dry in addition to mild symptoms Severe symptoms are fullness bloating above the waist shortness of breath pleural effusion urination significantly darker or has ceased calf and chest pains marked abdominal bloating or distention and lower abdominal pains in addition to mild and moderate symptoms
Overactive bladder is characterized by a group of four symptoms urgency urinary frequency nocturia and urge incontinence Urge incontinence is not present in the dry classification Urgency is considered the hallmark symptom of OAB but there are no clear criteria for what constitutes urgency and studies often use other criteria Urgency is currently defined by the International Continence Society ICS as of 2002 as Sudden compelling desire to pass urine that is difficult to defer The previous definition was Strong desire to void accompanied by fear of leakage or pain The definition does not address the immediacy of the urge to void and has been criticized as subjective Urinary frequency is considered abnormal if the person urinates more than eight times in a day This frequency is usually monitored by having the person keep a voiding diary where they record urination episodes The number of episodes varies depending on sleep fluid intake medications and up to seven is considered normal if consistent with the other factors Nocturia is a symptom where the person complains of interrupted sleep because of an urge to void and like the urinary frequency component is affected by similar lifestyle and medical factors Individual waking events are not considered abnormal one study in Finland established two or more voids per night as affecting quality of life Urge incontinence is a form of urinary incontinence characterized by the involuntary loss of urine occurring for no apparent reason while feeling urinary urgency as discussed above Like frequency the person can track incontinence in a diary to assist with diagnosis and management of symptoms Urge incontinence can also be measured with pad tests and these are often used for research purposes Some people with urge incontinence also have stress incontinence and this can complicate clinical studies It is important that the clinician and the person with overactive bladder both reach a consensus on the term urgency Some common phrases used to describe OAB include When Ive got to go Ive got to go or When I have to go I have to rush because I think I will wet myself Hence the term fear of leakage is an important concept to people
The classic sign of PNH is red discoloration of the urine due to the presence of hemoglobin and hemosiderin from the breakdown of red blood cells As the urine is more concentrated in the morning this is when the color is most pronounced This phenomenon mainly occurs in those who have the primary form of PNH who will notice this at some point in their disease course The remainder mainly experience the symptoms of anemia such as tiredness shortness of breath and palpitations A small proportion of patients report attacks of abdominal pain difficulty swallowing and pain during swallowing as well as erectile dysfunction in men this occurs mainly when the breakdown of red blood cells is rapid and is attributable to spasm of smooth muscle due to depletion of nitric oxide by red cell breakdown products Forty percent of people with PNH develop thrombosis a blood clot at some point in their illness This is the main cause of severe complications and death in PNH These may develop in common sites deep vein thrombosis of the leg and resultant pulmonary embolism when these clots break off and enter the lungs but in PNH blood clots may also form in more unusual sites the hepatic vein causing Budd Chiari syndrome the portal vein of the liver causing portal vein thrombosis the superior or inferior mesenteric vein causing mesenteric ischemia and veins of the skin Cerebral venous thrombosis an uncommon form of stroke is more common in those with PNH
Common symptoms include dyspnea shortness of breath Signs include tachycardia a heart rate exceeding the normal resting rate continuous machine like also described as rolling thunder and to and fro heart murmur usually from aorta to pulmonary artery with higher flow during systole and lower flow during diastole cardiomegaly enlarged heart reflecting ventricular dilation and volume overload left subclavicular thrill bounding pulse widened pulse pressure increased cardiac output increased systolic pressure poor growth differential cyanosis i e cyanosis of the lower extremities but not of the upper body People with patent ductus arteriosus typically present in good health with normal respirations and heart rate If the PDA is moderate or large widened pulse pressure and bounding peripheral pulses are frequently present reflecting increased left ventricular stroke volume and diastolic run off of blood into the initially lower resistance pulmonary vascular bed Eisenmenger physiology is pulmonary hypertension due to a left to right shunt Prominent suprasternal and carotid pulsations may be noted secondary to increased left ventricular stroke volume
Head lice are generally uncomfortable but typically do not constitute a serious condition The most common symptom is itching of the head which normally worsens 3 to 4 weeks after the initial infestation The bite reaction is very mild and it can be rarely seen between the hairs Bites can be seen especially in the neck of long haired individuals when the hair is pushed aside Swelling of the local lymph nodes and fever are rare Itching may cause skin breakdown and uncommonly result in a bacterial infection Many individuals do not experience symptoms Itching may take 2 6 weeks to develop upon first infestation and sooner in subsequent infestations In Ethiopia head lice appear to be able to spread louse born epidemic typhus and Bartonella quintana In Europe the head lice do not appear to carry these infections
Body lice are a nuisance in themselves and cause intense itching They are also vectors transmitters of other diseases and can spread epidemic typhus trench fever and louse borne relapsing fever
The onset of symptoms is typically three weeks after the first infestation of lice and is mainly an intense itch in the pubic area and groin particularly at night resulting from an allergic reaction to the saliva of feeding lice In some infestations a characteristic grey blue or slate coloration macule appears maculae caeruleae at the feeding site which may last for days Nits or live lice may be seen crawling on the skin Louse droppings may be noticed as a black powder in the underwear Scratch marks crusting scarring rust colored faecal material blood stained underwear and secondary bacterial infection may sometimes be seen Large lymph nodes in the groin and armpits may be felt Some people with pubic lice infestation may not have any symptoms
The classic symptoms of pellagra are diarrhea dermatitis dementia and death the four Ds A more comprehensive list of symptoms includes
Pemphigus vulgaris most commonly presents with oral blisters buccal and palatine mucosa especially but also includes cutaneous blisters Other mucosal surfaces the conjunctiva nose esophagus penis vulva vagina cervix and anus may also be affected Flaccid blisters over the skin are frequently seen with sparing of the skin covering the palms and soles Blisters commonly erode and leave ulcerated lesions and erosions A positive Nikolsky sign induction of blistering in normal skin or at the edge of a blister is indicative of the disease Severe pain with chewing can lead to weight loss and malnutrition
In the early stages periodontitis has very few symptoms and in many individuals the disease has progressed significantly before they seek treatment Symptoms may include
Pernicious anemia often presents slowly and can cause harm insidiously and unnoticeably Untreated it can lead to neurological complications and in serious cases death It can take several years for pernicious anemia to appear and the disease often goes unrecognized as the body becomes used to feeling unwell The onset may be vague and slow as the same symptoms are often also present with anemia in 81 1 of cases of cobalamin deficiency pernicious anemia is not observed Pernicious anemia may be present without a person experiencing symptoms at first over time feeling tired and weak lightheadedness dizziness headaches rapid or irregular heartbeat breathlessness glossitis a sore red tongue poor ability to exercise low blood pressure cold hands and feet pale or yellow skin easy bruising and bleeding low grade fevers shakiness cold sensitivity chest pain upset stomach nausea loss of appetite heartburn weight loss diarrhea constipation severe joint pain feeling abnormal sensations including tingling or numbness to the fingers and toes pins and needles and tinnitus may occur Anemia may present with a number of further common symptoms including hair thinning and loss early greying of the hair mouth ulcers bleeding gums angular cheilitis a look of exhaustion with pale and dehydrated or cracked lips and dark circles around the eyes as well as brittle nails In more severe or prolonged cases of pernicious anemia nerve cell damage may occur which can lead to more severe symptoms including sense loss difficulty in proprioception neuropathic pain unsteady walking ataxia poor balance loss of sensation in the feet muscle weakness blurred vision either due to retinopathy or optic neuropathy impaired urination fertility problems decreased sense of taste and smell decreased level of consciousness changes in reflexes memory loss mood swings depression irritability slurred speech cognitive impairment confusion anxiety clumsiness psychosis and in more severe cases dementia Anemia may also lead to cardiac murmurs and or altered blood pressure low or high The deficiency may also present with thyroid disorders In severe cases the anemia may cause congestive heart failure A complication of severe chronic PA is subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord which leads to distal sensory loss posterior column absent ankle reflex increased knee reflex response and extensor plantar response Other than anemia hematological symptoms may include cytopenias intramedullary hemolysis and pseudothrombotic microangiopathy Vitamin B12 deficiency which is reversible is occasionally confused with acute myeloid leukemia which is an irreversible autoimmune condition presenting with some of the same hematological symptoms including hypercellular bone marrow with blastic differentiation and hypersegmented neutrophils Pernicious anemia can contribute to a delay in physical growth in children and may also be a cause for delay in puberty for adolescents
One third of individuals with pinworm infection are totally asymptomatic The main symptoms are itching in and around the anus and perineum The itching occurs mainly during the night and is caused by the female pinworms migrating to lay eggs around the anus Both the migrating females and the clumps of eggs are irritating as well as the sticky substance that is produced by the worms when the eggs are laid The intensity of the itching varies and it can be described as tickling crawling sensations or even acute pain The itching leads to continuously scratching the area around the anus which can further result in tearing of the skin and complications such as secondary bacterial infections including bacterial skin inflammation and hair follicle inflammation General symptoms are trouble sleeping and restlessness A considerable proportion of children experience loss of appetite weight loss irritability emotional instability and bed wetting Pinworms cannot damage the skin and they do not normally migrate through tissues However they may move onto the vulva and into the vagina from there moving to the external orifice of the uterus and onwards to the uterine cavity fallopian tubes ovaries and peritoneal cavity This can cause inflammation of the vulva and vagina This causes vaginal discharge and itchiness of the vulva The pinworms can also enter the urethra and presumably they carry intestinal bacteria with them According to Gutierrez 2000 a statistically significant correlation between pinworm infection and urinary tract infections has been shown however Burkhart Burkhart 2005 maintain that the incidence of pinworms as a cause of urinary tract infections remains unknown One report indicated that 36 of young girls with a urinary tract infection also had pinworms Painful urination has been associated with pinworm infection The relationship between pinworm infestation and appendicitis has been researched but there is a lack of clear consensus on the matter While Gutiérrez maintains that there exists a consensus that pinworms do not produce the inflammatory reaction Cook 1994 states that it is controversial whether pinworms are causatively related to acute appendicitis and Burkhart Burkhart 2004 state that pinworm infection causes symptoms of appendicitis to surface
Signs and symptoms of PCOS include irregular or no menstrual periods heavy periods excess body and facial hair acne pelvic pain difficulty getting pregnant and patches of thick darker velvety skin This metabolic endocrine and reproductive disorder is not universally defined but the most common symptoms are irregular or absent periods ovarian cysts enlarged ovaries excess androgen weight gain and hirsutism Associated conditions include type 2 diabetes obesity obstructive sleep apnea heart disease mood disorders and endometrial cancer This disease is related to the number of follicles per ovary each month growing from the average range of 6 to 8 to double triple or more it is important to distinguish between PCOS the syndrome and a woman with PCO polycystic ovaries to have PCOS a woman must have at least two of these three symptoms PCO anovulation oligoovulation and hyperandrogenism This means that a woman can have PCOS displaying anovulation and hyperandrogenism without having PCO Conversely having PCO does not indicate that a person necessarily has PCOS
Acute porphyrias Acute intermittent porphyria AIP variegate porphyria VP aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency porphyria ALAD and hereditary coproporphyria HCP These diseases primarily affect the nervous system resulting in episodic crises known as acute attacks The major symptom of an acute attack is abdominal pain often accompanied by vomiting hypertension elevated blood pressure and tachycardia an abnormally rapid heart rate The most severe episodes may involve neurological complications typically motor neuropathy severe dysfunction of the peripheral nerves that innervate muscle which leads to muscle weakness and potentially to quadriplegia paralysis of all four limbs and central nervous system symptoms such as seizures and coma Occasionally there may be short lived psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety confusion hallucinations and very rarely overt psychosis All these symptoms resolve once the acute attack passes Given the many presentations and the relatively low occurrence of porphyria patients may initially be suspected to have other unrelated conditions For instance the polyneuropathy of acute porphyria may be mistaken for Guillain Barré syndrome and porphyria testing is commonly recommended in those situations Elevation of aminolevulinic acid from lead induced disruption of heme synthesis results in lead poisoning having symptoms similar to acute porphyria
Symptoms With resolution of the herpes zoster eruption pain that continues for three months or more is defined as postherpetic neuralgia Pain is variable from discomfort to very severe and may be described as burning stabbing or gnawing Signs Area of previous herpes zoster may show evidence of cutaneous scarring Sensation may be altered over the areas involved in the form of either hypersensitivity or decreased sensation In rare cases the patient might also experience muscle weakness tremor or paralysis if the nerves involved also control muscle movement
Clinicians consider mood symptoms physical symptoms and impact on the patients life in making the diagnosis of PMDD Mood symptoms include emotional lability rapidly changing emotions sensitivity to rejection etc irritability and anger that may lead to conflict anxiety feeling on edge hopelessness difficulty concentrating appetite changes sleeping more or less than usual or feeling out of control The physical symptoms are similar to the symptoms of PMS These include breast tenderness or swelling joint pain muscle pain gaining weight or feeling bloated Because of the broad variety in clinical presentation the onset of symptoms only during or around the luteal phase is key for diagnosing someone with PMDD rather than any other mood disorders PMDD follows a predictable cyclic pattern Symptoms begin in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle after ovulation and end or are markedly reduced shortly after menstruation begins On average the symptoms last six days but can start up to two weeks before menses meaning symptoms can be felt for up to three weeks out of a cycle Severe symptoms can begin and worsen until the onset of menstruation with many not feeling relief until a few days after menstruation ends The most intense symptoms occurring in the week and days leading up to the first day of menstrual blood flow The symptoms usually cease shortly after the start of the menstrual period or a few days after it ends Various symptom and severity tracking questionnaires exist to document presence and severity of symptoms throughout consecutive menstrual cycles The International Society for the Study of Premenstrual Disorders ISPMD defines two categories of premenstrual disorders core PMD and variant PMD Core PMD has six characteristics all mainly focusing on the cyclical nature of PMDD and its typical onset pre menses tracked over the course of more than two menstrual cycles The four classified Variant PMDs involve more unexpected variables that cause the onset of premenstrual distress such as PMD with absent menstruation or premenstrual exacerbation wherein the symptoms of another preexisting psychological disorder may be heightened as a result of PMDD onset
More than 200 different symptoms have been associated with PMS Common emotional and non specific symptoms include stress anxiety difficulty with sleep headache feeling tired mood swings increased emotional sensitivity and changes in interest in sex Problems with concentration and memory may occur There may also be depression or anxiety Physical symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle but not necessarily with PMS which is symptoms that appear before menstruation rather than during menstruation include bloating lower back pain cramps in the pelvic area constipation diarrhea swelling or tenderness in the breasts cyclic acne acne that appears and disappears at predictable times during the menstrual cycle joint or muscle pain and food cravings The exact symptoms and their intensity vary significantly from person to person and even somewhat from cycle to cycle and over time Most people with premenstrual syndrome experience only a few of the possible symptoms in a relatively predictable pattern Premenstrual dysphoric disorder PMDD is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome affecting 3 8 of menstruating women
People with PBC experience fatigue 80 this is a nonspecific symptom and can be debilitating with a huge impact on quality of life Its pathogenesis is still unknown and is quite challenging to explore its specificity and to treat Comorbidities that could contribute or worsen fatigue such as depression hypothyroidism anaemia obesity or medication side effects should be promptly identified and treated Dry skin and dry eyes are also common Itching pruritus occurs in 20 70 of cases and can develop at any stage of the disease it does not correlate with progression of liver disease and may even improve or disappear as the disease advances It is typically mild to moderate in intensity Given the impact on quality of life and night sleep pruritus is correlated with fatigue It can rarely be severe nonresponsive to medical therapy and requiring liver transplant Pruritus is characteristically intermittent worse at night and improves during summer People with more severe PBC may have jaundice yellowing of the eyes and skin PBC impairs bone density and the risk of fracture increases Xanthelasma skin lesions around the eyes or other xanthoma may be present as a result of increased cholesterol levels PBC can eventually progress to cirrhosis of the liver This in turn may lead to a number of symptoms or complications including
A common symptom is a continual urge to have a bowel movement the rectum could feel full or have constipation Another is tenderness and mild irritation in the rectum and anal region A serious symptom is pus and blood in the discharge accompanied by cramps and pain during the bowel movement If there is severe bleeding anemia can result showing symptoms such as pale skin irritability weakness dizziness brittle nails and shortness of breath Symptoms are ineffectual straining to empty the bowels diarrhea rectal bleeding and possible discharge a feeling of not having adequately emptied the bowels involuntary spasms and cramping during bowel movements left sided abdominal pain passage of mucus through the rectum and anorectal pain
The cardinal feature of the disorder is a pathologically lowered threshold for exhibiting the behavioral response of laughter crying anger or all of the above An affected individual exhibits episodes of laughter crying anger or a combination of these without an apparent motivating stimulus or in response to stimuli that would not have elicited such an emotional response before the onset of their underlying neurologic disorder In some patients the emotional response is exaggerated in intensity but is provoked by a stimulus with an emotional valence congruent with the character of the emotional display For example a sad stimulus provokes a pathologically exaggerated weeping response instead of a sigh which the patient normally would have exhibited in that particular instance However in some other patients the character of the emotional display can be incongruent with and even contradictory to the emotional valence of the provoking stimulus or may be incited by a stimulus with no clear valence For example a patient may laugh in response to sad news or cry in response to stimuli with no emotional undertone or once provoked the episodes may switch from laughing to crying or vice versa The symptoms of PBA can be severe with persistent and unremitting episodes Characteristics include
The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include the following
While a few seconds may not result in problems longer periods are dangerous Short periods may occur without symptoms or present with lightheadedness palpitations or chest pain Ventricular tachycardia may turn into ventricular fibrillation and can result in cardiac arrest
The appearance of pyogenic granuloma is usually a color ranging from red pink to purple grows rapidly and can be smooth or mushroom shaped Younger lesions are more likely to be red because of their high number of blood vessels Older lesions begin to change into a pink color Size commonly ranges from a few millimeters to centimeters though smaller or larger lesions may occur A pyogenic granuloma can be painful especially if located in an area of the body where it is constantly disturbed Pyogenic granulomas can grow rapidly and often bleed profusely with little or no trauma They may exude an oil like substance causing the surface to be damp This is especially true if the granuloma is located on the scalp Epulis granulomatosum is a variant of pyogenic granuloma that forms only on gingiva and is often seen forming in a recent extraction socket Pyogenic granulomas appear on the gingiva in 75 of cases more often in the maxillary than mandibular jaw Anterior areas are more often affected than posterior areas It can also be found on the lips tongue and inner cheek Poor oral hygiene or trauma are usually precipitating factors One study has suggested a correlation between pyogenic granulomas and Bartonella seropositivity However this association has been questioned by others The microscopic appearance of a pyogenic granuloma consists of highly vascular granulation tissue Inflammation is present The lesion may have a fibrous character if it is older and the surface may have ulcerations Pyogenic granulomas rarely occur in the conjunctiva cornea or connective tissue of the eye following minor local trauma Grossly these mass lesions resemble those occurring at more common sites The relationship of these lesions to lobular capillary hemangiomas of skin and oropharyngeal mucosa commonly referred to as pyogenic granuloma is uncertain
The classic clinical syndrome for vitamin B6 deficiency is a seborrhoeic dermatitis like eruption atrophic glossitis with ulceration angular cheilitis conjunctivitis intertrigo and neurologic symptoms of somnolence confusion and neuropathy due to impaired sphingosine synthesis and microcytic anemia due to impaired heme synthesis Less severe cases present with metabolic disease associated with insufficient activity of the coenzyme PLP The most prominent of the lesions is due to impaired tryptophan niacin conversion This can be detected based on urinary excretion of xanthurenic acid after an oral tryptophan load Vitamin B6 deficiency can also result in impaired transsulfuration of methionine to cysteine The PLP dependent transaminases and glycogen phosphorylase provide the vitamin with its role in gluconeogenesis so deprivation of vitamin B6 results in impaired glucose tolerance
Symptoms are different for every person depending on the type of rat bite fever with which the person is infected Both spirillary and streptobacillary rat bite fever have a few individual symptoms although most symptoms are shared Streptobacillosis is most commonly found in the United States and spirillary rat bite fever is generally diagnosed in Africa Rat bite symptoms are visually seen in most cases and include inflammation around the open sore A rash can also spread around the area and appear red or purple Other symptoms associated with streptobacillary rat bite fever include chills fever vomiting headaches and muscle aches Joints can also become painfully swollen and pain can be experienced in the back Skin irritations such as ulcers or inflammation can develop on the hands and feet Wounds heal slowly so symptoms possibly come and go over the course of a few months Symptoms associated with spirillary rat bite fever include issues with the lymph nodes which often swell or become inflamed as a reaction to the infection The most common locations of lymph node swelling are in the neck groin and underarm Symptoms generally appear within two to ten days of exposure to the infected animal It begins with the fever and progresses to the rash on the hands and feet within two to four days The rash appears all over the body with this form but rarely causes joint pain
The condition can cause localized pain discoloration paleness and sensations of cold and or numbness When exposed to cold temperatures the blood supply to the fingers or toes and in some cases the nose or earlobes is markedly reduced the skin turns pale or white called pallor and becomes cold and numb These events are episodic and when the episode subsides or the area is warmed the blood flow returns and the skin color first turns red rubor and then back to normal often accompanied by swelling tingling and a painful pins and needles sensation All three color changes are observed in classic Raynauds However not all patients see all of the aforementioned color changes in all episodes especially in milder cases of the condition The red flush is due to reactive hyperemia of the areas deprived of blood flow In pregnancy this sign normally disappears due to increased surface blood flow Raynauds has occurred in breastfeeding mothers causing nipples to turn white and painful
Renal colic typically begins in the flank and often radiates to below the ribs or the groin It typically comes in waves due to ureteric peristalsis but may be constant It is often described as one of the most severe pains Although this condition can be very painful most ureteric stones under 5 mm size will eventually pass into the bladder without needing treatments and cause no permanent physical damage The experience is said to be traumatizing due to the severe pain and the experience of passing blood and clots as well as pieces of stone In most cases people with renal colic are advised to drink more water to facilitate passing in other instances lithotripsy or endoscopic surgery may be needed Preventive treatment can be instituted to minimize the likelihood of recurrence
RMS can occur in almost any soft tissue site in the body the most common primary sites are genitourinary 24 parameningeal 16 extremity 19 orbit 9 other head and neck 10 and miscellaneous other sites 22 RMS often presents as a mass but signs and symptoms can vary widely depending on the site of the primary tumor Genitourinary tumors may present with hematuria urinary tract obstruction and or a scrotal or vaginal mass Tumors that arise in the retroperitoneum and mediastinum can become quite large before producing signs and symptoms Parameningeal tumors may present with cranial nerve dysfunction symptoms of sinusitis ear discharge headaches and facial pain Orbital tumors often present with orbital swelling and proptosis Extremity tumors generally present as a rapidly enlarging firm mass in the relevant tissue The cancers prevalence in the head face and neck will often allow for earlier signs of the disease simply due to the obvious nature of tumors in these locations Despite the varying presentation and typically aggressive nature of the disease RMS has the potential to be diagnosed and treated early The fourth IRSG study found that 23 of patients were diagnosed in time for a complete resection of their cancer and 15 had resection with only minimal remnants of the diseased cells
The disease typically develops two to four weeks after a throat infection Symptoms include fever painful joints with those joints affected changing with time involuntary muscle movements and occasionally a characteristic non itchy rash known as erythema marginatum The heart is involved in about half of the cases Damage to the heart valves usually occurs only after multiple attacks but may occasionally occur after a single case of RF The damaged valves may result in heart failure and also increase the risk of atrial fibrillation and infection of the valves
Riboflavin deficiency also called ariboflavinosis results in stomatitis symptoms of which include chapped and fissured lips inflammation of the corners of the mouth angular stomatitis sore throat painful red tongue and hair loss The eyes can become itchy watery bloodshot and sensitive to light Riboflavin deficiency is associated with anemia Prolonged riboflavin insufficiency may cause degeneration of the liver and nervous system Riboflavin deficiency may increase the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women Deficiency of riboflavin during pregnancy can result in fetal birth defects including heart and limb deformities
Signs and symptoms of dietary deficiency rickets can include bone tenderness and a susceptibility for bone fractures particularly greenstick fractures Early skeletal deformities can arise in infants such as soft thinned skull bones a condition known as craniotabes which is the first sign of rickets skull bossing may be present and a delayed closure of the fontanelles Young children may have bowed legs and thickened ankles and wrists older children may have knock knees Spinal curvatures of kyphoscoliosis or lumbar lordosis may be present The pelvic bones may be deformed A condition known as rachitic rosary can result as the thickening caused by nodules forming on the costochondral joints This appears as a visible bump in the middle of each rib in a line on each side of the body This somewhat resembles a rosary giving rise to its name The deformity of a pigeon chest may result in the presence of Harrisons groove Hypocalcemia a low level of calcium in the blood can result in tetany uncontrolled muscle spasms Dental problems can also arise An X ray or radiograph of an advanced patient with rickets tends to present in a classic way the bowed legs outward curve of long bone of the legs and a deformed chest Changes in the skull also occur causing a distinctive square headed appearance known as caput quadratum These deformities persist into adult life if not treated Long term consequences include permanent curvatures or disfiguration of the long bones and a curved back
Spotted fever can be very difficult to diagnose in its early stages due to the similarity of symptoms with many different diseases People infected with R rickettsii usually notice symptoms following an incubation period of one to two weeks after a tick bite The early clinical presentation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is nonspecific and may resemble a variety of other infectious and noninfectious diseases Initial symptoms Fever Nausea Emesis vomiting Severe headache Muscle pain MalaiseLater signs and symptoms Maculopapular rash Petechial rash Abdominal pain Joint pain Conjunctivitis ForgetfulnessThe classic triad of findings for this disease are fever rash and history of tick bite However this combination is often not identified when patients initially present for care The rash has a centripetal or inward pattern of spread meaning it begins at the extremities and courses towards the trunk
Rosacea typically begins with reddening of the skin in symmetrical patches near the center of the face Common signs can depend on age and sex flushing and red swollen patches are common in the young small and visible dilated blood vessels in older individuals and swelling of the nose is common in men Other signs include lumps on the skin papules or pustules and swelling of the face Many people experience stinging or burning pain and rarely itching Skin problems tend to be aggravated by particular trigger factors that differ for different people Common triggers are ultraviolet light heat cold or certain foods or beverages
Enteritis After a short incubation period of a few hours to one day the bacteria multiply in the small intestine causing an intestinal inflammation enteritis Most people with salmonellosis develop diarrhea fever vomiting and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection Diarrhea is often watery and non bloody but may be mucoid and bloody In most cases the illness lasts four to seven days and does not require treatment In some cases though the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient becomes dangerously dehydrated and must be hospitalized At the hospital the patient may receive fluids intravenously to treat the dehydration and may be given medications to provide symptomatic relief such as fever reduction In severe cases the Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics In otherwise healthy adults the symptoms can be mild Normally no sepsis occurs but it can occur exceptionally as a complication in the immunocompromised However in people at risk such as infants small children and the elderly Salmonella infections can become very serious leading to complications In infants dehydration can cause a state of severe toxicity Extraintestinal localizations are possible especially Salmonella meningitis in children osteitis etc Children with sickle cell anemia who are infected with Salmonella may develop osteomyelitis Treatment of osteomyelitis in this case will be to use fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin levofloxacin etc and nalidixic acid Those whose only symptom is diarrhea usually completely recover but their bowel habits may not return to normal for several months
The characteristic symptoms of a scabies infection include intense itching and superficial burrows Because the host develops the symptoms as a reaction to the mites presence over time typically a delay of four to six weeks occurs between the onset of infestation and the onset of itching Similarly symptoms often persist for one to several weeks after successful eradication of the mites As noted those re exposed to scabies after successful treatment may exhibit symptoms of the new infestation in a much shorter period as little as one to four days
Many individuals do not experience symptoms If symptoms do appear they usually take 4 6 weeks from the time of infection The first symptom of the disease may be a general feeling of illness Within 12 hours of infection an individual may complain of a tingling sensation or light rash commonly referred to as swimmers itch due to irritation at the point of entrance The rash that may develop can mimic scabies and other types of rashes Other symptoms can occur 2 10 weeks later and can include fever aching a cough diarrhea chills or gland enlargement These symptoms can also be related to avian schistosomiasis which does not cause any further symptoms in humans The manifestations of schistosomal infection vary over time as the cercariae and later adult worms and their eggs migrate through the body If eggs migrate to the brain or spinal cord seizures paralysis or spinal cord inflammation are possible
Early symptoms are malaise and lethargy After one to three months patients develop shortness of breath and bone pain Myalgias may occur because of reduced carnitine production Other symptoms include skin changes with roughness easy bruising and petechiae gum disease loosening of teeth poor wound healing and emotional changes which may appear before any physical changes Dry mouth and dry eyes similar to Sjögrens syndrome may occur In the late stages jaundice generalised edema oliguria neuropathy fever convulsions and eventual death are frequently seen
SAD is a type of major depressive disorder and those with the condition may exhibit any of the associated symptoms such as feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness thoughts of suicide loss of interest in activities withdrawal from social interaction sleep and appetite problems difficulty with concentrating and making decisions decreased libido a lack of energy or agitation Symptoms of winter SAD often include falling asleep earlier or in less than 5 minutes in the evening oversleeping or difficulty waking up in the morning nausea and a tendency to overeat often with a craving for carbohydrates which leads to weight gain SAD is typically associated with winter depression but springtime lethargy or other seasonal mood patterns are not uncommon Although each individual case is different in contrast to winter SAD people who experience spring and summer depression may be more likely to show symptoms such as insomnia decreased appetite and weight loss and agitation or anxiety
Seborrhoeic dermatitis symptoms appear gradually and usually the first signs are flaky skin and scalp Symptoms occur most commonly anywhere on the skin of the scalp behind the ears on the face and in areas where the skin folds Flakes may be yellow white or grayish Redness and flaking may also occur on the skin near the eyelashes on the forehead around the sides of the nose on the chest and on the upper back In more severe cases yellowish to reddish scaly pimples appear along the hairline behind the ears in the ear canal on the eyebrows on the bridge of the nose around the nose on the chest and on the upper back Commonly patients experience mild redness scaly skin lesions and in some cases hair loss Other symptoms include patchy scaling or thick crusts on the scalp red greasy skin covered with flaky white or yellow scales itching soreness and yellow or white scales that may attach to the hair shaft Seborrhoeic dermatitis can occur in infants younger than three months and it causes a thick oily yellowish crust around the hairline and on the scalp Itching is not common among infants Frequently a stubborn diaper rash accompanies the scalp rash
Sézary disease and mycosis fungoides are cutaneous T cell lymphomas having a primary manifestation in the skin The diseases origin is a peripheral CD4 T lymphocyte although rarer CD8 CD4 cases have been observed Epidermotropism lymphocytes residing in the epidermis by neoplastic CD4 lymphocytes with the formation of Pautriers microabscesses is the hallmark sign of the disease Although the condition can affect people of all ages it is commonly diagnosed in adults over age 60 The dominant signs and symptoms of the disease are
Signs and symptoms may range from mild abdominal discomfort to full blown dysentery characterized by cramps diarrhea with slimy consistent stools fever blood pus or mucus in stools or tenesmus Onset time is 12 to 96 hours and recovery takes 5 to 7 days Infections are associated with mucosal ulceration rectal bleeding and drastic dehydration Reactive arthritis and hemolytic uremic syndrome are possible sequelae that have been reported in the aftermath of shigellosis The most common neurological symptom includes seizures
The symptoms of short bowel syndrome can include Abdominal pain Diarrhea and steatorrhea oily bulky stool which can be malodorous Fluid depletion Weight loss and malnutrition FatiguePersons with short bowel syndrome may have complications caused by malabsorption of vitamins and minerals such as deficiencies in vitamins A D E K B9 folic acid and B12 calcium magnesium iron and zinc These may appear as anemia hyperkeratosis scaling of the skin easy bruising muscle spasms poor blood clotting and bone pain
The universal feature of night terrors is inconsolability very similar to that of a panic attack During night terror bouts people are usually described as bolting upright with their eyes wide open and a look of fear and panic on their faces They will often yell scream or attempt to speak though such speech is often incomprehensible Furthermore they will usually sweat exhibit rapid breathing and have a rapid heart rate autonomic signs In some cases individuals are likely to have even more elaborate motor activity such as a thrashing of limbs which may include punching swinging or fleeing motions There is a sense that the individuals are trying to protect themselves and or escape from a possible threat of bodily injury Although people may seem to be awake during a night terror they will appear confused be inconsolable and or unresponsive to attempts to communicate with them and may not recognize others familiar to them Occasionally when a person with a night terror is awakened they will lash out at the one awakening them which can be dangerous to that individual Most people who experience this do not remember the incident the next day although brief dream images or hallucinations may occur and be recalled Sleepwalking is also common during night terror bouts as sleepwalking and night terrors are different manifestations of the same parasomnia Both children and adults may display behaviour indicative of attempting to escape some may thrash about or get out of bed and begin walking or running around aimlessly while inconsolable increasing the risk of accidental injury The risk of injury to others may be exacerbated by inadvertent provocation by nearby people whose efforts to calm the individual may result in a physically violent response from the individual as they attempt to escape During lab tests subjects are known to have very high voltages of electroencephalography EEG delta activity an increase in muscle tone and a doubled or faster heart rate Brain activities during a typical episode show theta and alpha activity when monitored with an EEG Episodes can include tachycardia Night terrors are also associated with intense autonomic discharge of tachypnea flushing diaphoresis and mydriasis that is unconscious or involuntary rapid breathing reddening of the skin profuse sweating and dilation of the pupils Abrupt but calmer arousal from NREM sleep short of a full night terror episode is also common In children with night terrors there is no increased occurrence of psychiatric diagnoses However in adults with night terrors there is a close association with psychopathology and mental disorders There may be an increased occurrence of night terrors particularly among those with post traumatic stress disorder PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder GAD It is also likely that some personality disorders may occur in individuals with night terrors such as dependent schizoid and borderline personality disorders There have been some symptoms of depression and anxiety that have increased in individuals that have frequent night terrors Low blood sugar is associated with both pediatric and adult night terrors A study of adults with thalamic lesions of the brain and brainstem have been occasionally associated with night terrors Night terrors are closely linked to sleepwalking and frontal lobe epilepsy
The initial symptoms were similar to other viral diseases that are still extant such as influenza and the common cold fever of at least 38 3 C 101 F muscle pain malaise headache and fatigue As the digestive tract was commonly involved nausea vomiting and backache often occurred The early prodromal stage usually lasted 2 4 days By days 12 15 the first visible lesions small reddish spots called enanthem appeared on mucous membranes of the mouth tongue palate and throat and the temperature fell to near normal These lesions rapidly enlarged and ruptured releasing large amounts of virus into the saliva Smallpox virus tended to attack skin cells causing the characteristic pimples or macules associated with the disease A rash developed on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appeared Typically the macules first appeared on the forehead then rapidly spread to the whole face proximal portions of extremities the trunk and lastly to distal portions of extremities The process took no more than 24 to 36 hours after which no new lesions appeared At this point variola major infection could take several very different courses which resulted in four types of smallpox disease based on the Rao classification ordinary modified malignant or flat and hemorrhagic smallpox Historically ordinary smallpox had an overall fatality rate of about 30 and the malignant and hemorrhagic forms were usually fatal The modified form was almost never fatal In early hemorrhagic cases hemorrhages occurred before any skin lesions developed The incubation period between contraction and the first obvious symptoms of the disease was around 12 days
The most common first symptom of all snakebites is an overwhelming fear which may contribute to other symptoms and may include nausea and vomiting diarrhea vertigo fainting tachycardia and cold clammy skin Snake bites can have a variety of different signs and symptoms depending on their species Dry snakebites and those inflicted by a non venomous species may still cause severe injury The bite may become infected from the snakes saliva The fangs sometimes harbor pathogenic microbial organisms including Clostridium tetani and may require an updated tetanus immunization Most snakebites from either a venomous or a non venomous snake will have some type of local effect Minor pain and redness occur in over 90 percent of cases although this varies depending on the site Bites by vipers and some cobras may be extremely painful with the local tissue sometimes becoming tender and severely swollen within five minutes This area may also bleed and blister and may lead to tissue necrosis Other common initial symptoms of pit viper and viper bites include lethargy bleeding weakness nausea and vomiting Symptoms may become more life threatening over time developing into hypotension tachypnea severe tachycardia severe internal bleeding altered sensorium kidney failure and respiratory failure Bites by some snakes such as the kraits coral snake Mojave rattlesnake and the speckled rattlesnake may cause little or no pain despite their serious and potentially life threatening venom Some people report experiencing a rubbery minty or metallic taste after being bitten by certain species of rattlesnake Spitting cobras and rinkhalses can spit venom in a persons eyes This results in immediate pain ophthalmoparesis and sometimes blindness
Symptoms of spasmodic dysphonia can come on suddenly or gradually appear over the span of years They can come and go for hours or even weeks at a time or remain consistent Gradual onset can begin with the manifestation of a hoarse voice quality which may later transform into a voice quality described as strained with breaks in phonation These phonation breaks have been compared to stuttering in the past but there is a lack of research in support of spasmodic dysphonia being classified as a fluency disorder It is commonly reported by people with spasmodic dysphonia that symptoms almost only occur on vocal sounds that require phonation Symptoms are less likely to occur at rest while whispering or on speech sounds that do not require phonation It is hypothesized this occurs because of an increase in sporadic sudden and prolonged tension found in the muscles around the larynx during phonation This tension affects the abduction and adduction opening and closing of the vocal folds Consequently the vocal folds are unable to retain subglottal air pressure required for phonation and breaks in phonation can be heard throughout the speech of people with spasmodic dysphonia Regarding types of spasmodic dysphonia the main characteristic of spasmodic dysphonia breaks in phonation is found along with other varying symptoms The voice quality of adductor spasmodic dysphonia can be described as strained strangled from tension in the glottal region Voice quality for abductor spasmodic dysphonia can be described as breathy from variable widening of the glottal region Vocal tremor may also be seen in spasmodic dysphonia A mix and variance of these symptoms are found in mixed spasmodic dysphonia Symptoms of spasmodic dysphonia typically appear in middle aged people but have also been seen in people in their twenties with symptoms emerging as young as teenage years
Almost all spiders are venomous but not all spider bites result in the injection of venom Pain from non venomous bites so called dry bites typically lasts for 5 to 60 minutes while pain from envenomating spider bites may last for longer than 24 hours Bleeding also may occur with a bite Signs of a bacterial infection due to a spider bite occur infrequently 0 9 A study of 750 definite spider bites in Australia indicated that 6 of spider bites cause significant effects the vast majority of these being redback spider bites causing significant pain lasting more than 24 hours Activation of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to sweating high blood pressure and gooseflesh Most recluse spider bites are minor with little or no necrosis However a small number of bites produce necrotic skin lesions First pain and tenderness at the site begin The redness changes over two to three days to a bluish sinking patch of dead skin the hallmark of necrosis The wound heals slowly over months but usually completely Rarely bites may cause widespread symptoms with occasional fatalities There are a few spiders that can bite human skin and cause a skin reaction but spiders are blamed for many more reactions In particular the misdiagnosis of infections and other skin ailments are commonly attributed to brown recluses
Signs and symptoms of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP include fevers chills nausea vomiting abdominal pain and tenderness general malaise altered mental status and worsening ascites Thirteen percent of patients have no signs or symptoms In cases of acute or chronic liver failure SBP is one of the main triggers for hepatic encephalopathy and where there is no other clear causal indication for this SBP may be suspected These symptoms can also be the same for a spontaneous fungal peritonitis SFP and therefore make a differentiation difficult Delay of diagnosis can delay antifungal treatment and lead to a higher mortality rate
Cutaneous or skin sporotrichosisThis is the most common form of this disease Symptoms of this form include nodular lesions or bumps in the skin at the point of entry and also along lymph nodes and vessels The lesion starts off small and painless and ranges in color from pink to purple Left untreated the lesion becomes larger and look similar to a boil and more lesions will appear until a chronic ulcer develops Usually cutaneous sporotrichosis lesions occur in the finger hand and arm Pulmonary sporotrichosisThis rare form of the disease occur when S schenckii spores are inhaled Symptoms of pulmonary sporotrichosis include productive coughing nodules and cavitations of the lungs fibrosis and swollen hilar lymph nodes Patients with this form of sporotrichosis are susceptible to developing tuberculosis and pneumoniaDisseminated sporotrichosisWhen the infection spreads from the primary site to secondary sites in the body the disease develops into a rare and critical form called disseminated sporotrichosis The infection can spread to joints and bones called osteoarticular sporotrichosis as well as the central nervous system and the brain called sporotrichosis meningitis The symptoms of disseminated sporotrichosis include weight loss anorexia and appearance of bony lesions
When observing a person with strabismus the misalignment of the eyes may be quite apparent A person with a constant eye turn of significant magnitude is very easy to notice However a small magnitude or intermittent strabismus can easily be missed upon casual observation In any case an eye care professional can conduct various tests such as cover testing to determine the full extent of the strabismus Symptoms of strabismus include double vision and eye strain To avoid double vision the brain may adapt by ignoring one eye In this case often no noticeable symptoms are seen other than a minor loss of depth perception This deficit may not be noticeable in someone who has had strabismus since birth or early childhood as they have likely learned to judge depth and distances using monocular cues However a constant unilateral strabismus causing constant suppression is a risk for amblyopia in children Small angle and intermittent strabismus are more likely to cause disruptive visual symptoms In addition to headaches and eye strain symptoms may include an inability to read comfortably fatigue when reading and unstable or jittery vision
Strongyloides infection occurs in five forms As the infection continues and the larvae matures there may be respiratory symptoms Löfflers syndrome The infection may then become chronic with mainly digestive symptoms On reinfection when larvae migrate through the body from the skin to the lungs and finally to the small intestine there may be respiratory skin and digestive symptoms Finally the hyperinfection syndrome causes symptoms in many organ systems including the central nervous system
Eye floaters and loss of accommodation are among the earliest symptoms The disease may progress to severe inflammation of the uveal layer of the eye uveitis with pain and sensitivity of the eyes to light The affected eye often remains relatively painless while the inflammatory disease spreads through the uvea where characteristic focal infiltrates in the choroid named Dalén Fuchs nodules can be seen The retina however usually remains uninvolved although perivascular cuffing of the retinal vessels with inflammatory cells may occur Swelling of the optic disc papilledema secondary glaucoma vitiligo and poliosis of the eyelashes may accompany SO
Symptoms include tenderness on palpation swelling and pain often when exercising or with a specific movement
Tetanus often begins with mild spasms in the jaw muscles also known as lockjaw Similar spasms can also be a feature of trismus The spasms can also affect the facial muscles resulting in an appearance called risus sardonicus Chest neck back abdominal muscles and buttocks may be affected Back muscle spasms often cause arching called opisthotonus Sometimes the spasms affect muscles that help with breathing which can lead to breathing problems Prolonged muscular action causes sudden powerful and painful contractions of muscle groups called tetany These episodes can cause fractures and muscle tears Other symptoms include fever headache restlessness irritability feeding difficulties breathing problems burning sensation during urination urinary retention and loss of stool control Even with treatment about 10 of people who contract tetanus die The mortality rate is higher in unvaccinated people and people over 60 years of age
High platelet counts do not necessarily signal any clinical problems and can be picked up on a routine full blood count However it is important that a full medical history be elicited to ensure that the increased platelet count is not due to a secondary process Often it occurs in tandem with an inflammatory disease as the principal stimulants of platelet production e g thrombopoietin are elevated in these clinical states as part of the acute phase reaction High platelet counts can occur in patients with polycythemia vera high red blood cell counts and is an additional risk factor for complications A very small number of people report symptoms of erythromelalgia a burning sensation and redness of the extremities that resolves with cooling or aspirin or both Scientific literature sometimes excludes thrombocytosis from the scope of thrombophilia by definition but practically by the definition of thrombophilia as an increased predisposition to thrombosis thrombocytosis especially primary thrombocytosis is a potential cause of thrombophilia Conversely secondary thrombocytosis very rarely causes thrombotic complications
Main symptoms that occur when affected with tinea barbae is pimple or blister amongst affected area swelling and redness around infected area red and lumpy skin on infected area Crusting around hairs in infected area will occur hairs on infected area will also be effortless to pull out Tinea barbae can be itchy or painful to touch but these symptoms do not always occur
It may have a variety of appearances most easily identifiable are the enlarging raised red rings with a central area of clearing ringworm The same appearances of ringworm may also occur on the scalp tinea capitis beard area tinea barbae or the groin tinea cruris known as jock itch or dhobi itch Other classic features of tinea corporis include
Typically over the upper inner thighs there is a red raised rash with a scaly well defined border There may be some blistering and weeping and the rash can reach near to the anus The distribution is usually on both sides of the groin and the center may be lighter in colour The rash may appear reddish tan or brown with flaking rippling peeling iridescence or cracking skin If the person is hairy hair follicles can become inflamed resulting in some bumps papules nodules and pustules within the plaque The plaque may reach the scrotum in men and the labia majora and mons pubis in women The penis is usually unaffected unless there is immunodeficiency or there has been use of steroids Affected people usually experience intense itching in the groin which can extend to the anus
Athletes foot is divided into four categories or presentations chronic interdigital plantar chronic scaly aka moccasin foot acute ulcerative and vesiculobullous Interdigital means between the toes Plantar here refers to the sole of the foot The ulcerative condition includes macerated lesions with scaly borders Maceration is the softening and breaking down of skin due to extensive exposure to moisture A vesiculobullous disease is a type of mucocutaneous disease characterized by vesicles and bullae blisters Both vesicles and bullae are fluid filled lesions and they are distinguished by size vesicles being less than 5 10 mm and bulla being larger than 5 10 mm depending upon what definition is used Athletes foot occurs most often between the toes interdigital with the space between the fourth and fifth digits the little toe and the fore toe most commonly affected Cases of interdigital athletes foot caused by Trichophyton rubrum may be symptomless it may itch or the skin between the toes may appear red or ulcerative scaly flaky with soft and white if skin has been kept wet with or without itching An acute ulcerative variant of interdigital athletes foot caused by T mentagrophytes is characterized by pain maceration of the skin erosions and fissuring of the skin crusting and an odor due to secondary bacterial infection Plantar athletes foot moccasin foot is also caused by T rubrum which typically causes asymptomatic slightly erythematous plaques areas of redness of the skin to form on the plantar surface sole of the foot that are often covered by fine powdery hyperkeratotic scales The vesiculobullous type of athletes foot is less common and is usually caused by T mentagrophytes and is characterized by a sudden outbreak of itchy blisters and vesicles on an erythematous base usually appearing on the sole of the foot This subtype of athletes foot is often complicated by secondary bacterial infection by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus
The symptoms of this condition include
Infection has three stages
The bacterium has an incubation period of 6 to 12 days after which the affected individual experiences symptoms of conjunctivitis or irritation similar to pink eye Blinding endemic trachoma results from multiple episodes of reinfection that maintains the intense inflammation in the conjunctiva Without reinfection the inflammation gradually subsides The conjunctival inflammation is called active trachoma and usually is seen in children especially preschool children It is characterized by white lumps in the undersurface of the upper eyelid conjunctival follicles or lymphoid germinal centres and by nonspecific inflammation and thickening often associated with papillae Follicles may also appear at the junction of the cornea and the sclera limbal follicles Active trachoma often can be irritating and have a watery discharge Bacterial secondary infection may occur and cause a purulent discharge The later structural changes of trachoma are referred to as cicatricial trachoma These include scarring in the eyelid tarsal conjunctiva that leads to distortion of the eyelid with buckling of the lid tarsus so the lashes rub on the eye trichiasis These lashes can lead to corneal opacities and scarring and then to blindness Linear scars present in the sulcus subtarsalis are called Arlts lines named after Carl Ferdinand von Arlt In addition blood vessels and scar tissue can invade the upper cornea pannus Resolved limbal follicles may leave small gaps in the pannus Herberts pits Most commonly children with active trachoma do not present with any symptoms as the low grade irritation and ocular discharge is just accepted as normal but further symptoms may include
The onset of TD usually occurs within the first week of travel but may occur at any time while traveling and even after returning home depending on the incubation period of the infectious agent Bacterial TD typically begins abruptly but Cryptosporidium may incubate for seven days and Giardia for 14 days or more before symptoms develop Typically a traveler experiences four to five loose or watery bowel movements each day Other commonly associated symptoms are abdominal cramping bloating fever and malaise Appetite may decrease significantly Though unpleasant most cases of TD are mild and resolve in a few days without medical intervention Blood or mucus in the diarrhea significant abdominal pain or high fever suggests a more serious cause such as cholera characterized by a rapid onset of weakness and torrents of watery diarrhea with flecks of mucus described as rice water stools Medical care should be sought in such cases dehydration is a serious consequence of cholera and may trigger serious sequelae including in rare instances death as rapidly as 24 hours after onset if not addressed promptly
The great majority of trichinosis infections have either minor or no symptoms and no complications The two main phases for the infection are enteral affecting the intestines and parenteral outside the intestines The symptoms vary depending on the phase species of Trichinella quantity of encysted larvae ingested age sex and host immunity
Most people infected with Trichomonas vaginalis do not have any symptoms and can be undetected for years Symptoms experienced include pain burning or itching in the penis urethra urethritis or vagina vaginitis Discomfort for both sexes may increase during intercourse and urination For women there may also be a yellow green itchy frothy foul smelling fishy smell vaginal discharge In rare cases lower abdominal pain can occur Symptoms usually appear within 5 to 28 days of exposure Sometimes trichomoniasis can be confused with chlamydia because the symptoms are similar
The peripheral autonomic nervous system central nervous system and the heart are the main systems that are affected following overdose Initial or mild symptoms typically develop within 2 hours and include tachycardia drowsiness a dry mouth nausea and vomiting urinary retention confusion agitation and headache More severe complications include hypotension cardiac rhythm disturbances hallucinations and seizures Electrocardiogram ECG abnormalities are frequent and a wide variety of cardiac dysrhythmias can occur the most common being sinus tachycardia and intraventricular conduction delay resulting in prolongation of the QRS complex and the PR QT intervals Seizures cardiac dysrhythmias and apnea are the most important life threatening complications
This disorder is characterized by episodes of severe facial pain along the trigeminal nerve divisions The trigeminal nerve is a paired cranial nerve that has three major branches the ophthalmic nerve V1 the maxillary nerve V2 and the mandibular nerve V3 One two or all three branches of the nerve may be affected Trigeminal neuralgia most commonly involves the middle branch the maxillary nerve or V2 and lower branch mandibular nerve or V3 of the trigeminal nerve An individual attack usually lasts from a few seconds to several minutes or hours but these can repeat for hours with very short intervals between attacks In other instances only 4 10 attacks are experienced daily The episodes of intense pain may occur paroxysmally To describe the pain sensation people often describe a trigger area on the face so sensitive that touching or even air currents can trigger an episode however in many people the pain is generated spontaneously without any apparent stimulation It affects lifestyle as it can be triggered by common activities such as eating talking shaving and brushing teeth The wind chewing and talking can aggravate the condition in many patients The attacks are said by those affected to feel like stabbing electric shocks burning sharp pressing crushing exploding or shooting pain that becomes intractable The pain also tends to occur in cycles with remissions lasting months or even years Pain attacks are known to worsen in frequency or severity over time in some people Pain may migrate to other branches over time but in some people remains very stable Bilateral occurring on both sides trigeminal neuralgia is very rare except for trigeminal neuralgia caused by multiple sclerosis MS This normally indicates problems with both trigeminal nerves since one nerve serves the left side of the face and the other serves the right side Occasional reports of bilateral trigeminal neuralgia reflect successive episodes of unilateral only one side pain switching the side of the face rather than pain occurring simultaneously on both sides Rapid spreading of the pain bilateral involvement or simultaneous participation with other major nerve trunks such as Painful Tic Convulsif of nerves V VII or occurrence of symptoms in the V and IX nerves may suggest a systemic cause Systemic causes could include multiple sclerosis or expanding cranial tumors The severity of the pain makes it difficult to wash the face shave and perform good oral hygiene The pain has a significant impact on activities of daily living especially as those affected live in fear of when they are going to get their next attack of pain and how severe it will be It can lead to severe depression and anxiety However not all people will have the symptoms described above and there are variants of TN One of which is atypical trigeminal neuralgia trigeminal neuralgia type 2 or trigeminal neuralgia with concomitant pain based on a recent classification of facial pain In these instances there is also a more prolonged lower severity background pain that can be present for over 50 of the time and is described more as a burning or prickling rather than a shock Trigeminal pain can also occur after an attack of herpes zoster Post herpetic neuralgia has the same manifestations as in other parts of the body Herpes zoster oticus typically presents with inability to move many facial muscles pain in the ear taste loss on the front of the tongue dry eyes and mouth and a vesicular rash Less than 1 of varicella zoster infections involve the facial nerve and result in this occurring Trigeminal deafferentation pain TDP also termed anesthesia dolorosa or colloquially as phantom face pain is from intentional damage to a trigeminal nerve following attempts to surgically fix a nerve problem This pain is usually constant with a burning sensation and numbness TDP is very difficult to treat as further surgeries are usually ineffective and possibly detrimental to the person
The illness usually starts with an attack of acute diarrhoea fever and malaise following which after a variable period the patient settles into the chronic phase of diarrhoea steatorrhoea weight loss anorexia malaise and nutritional deficiencies The symptoms of tropical sprue are
Classically the progression of untreated typhoid fever has three distinct stages each lasting about a week Over the course of these stages the patient becomes exhausted and emaciated In the first week the body temperature rises slowly and fever fluctuations are seen with relative bradycardia Faget sign malaise headache and cough A bloody nose epistaxis is seen in a quarter of cases and abdominal pain is also possible A decrease in the number of circulating white blood cells leukopenia occurs with eosinopenia and relative lymphocytosis blood cultures are positive for S enterica subsp enterica serovar Typhi The Widal test is usually negative In the second week the person is often too tired to get up with high fever in plateau around 40 C 104 F and bradycardia sphygmothermic dissociation or Faget sign classically with a dicrotic pulse wave Delirium can occur where the patient is often calm but sometimes becomes agitated This delirium has given typhoid the nickname nervous fever Rose spots appear on the lower chest and abdomen in around a third of patients Rhonchi rattling breathing sounds are heard in the base of the lungs The abdomen is distended and painful in the right lower quadrant where a rumbling sound can be heard Diarrhea can occur in this stage but constipation is also common The spleen and liver are enlarged hepatosplenomegaly and tender and liver transaminases are elevated The Widal test is strongly positive with antiO and antiH antibodies Blood cultures are sometimes still positive In the third week of typhoid fever a number of complications can occur The fever is still very high and oscillates very little over 24 hours Dehydration ensues along with malnutrition and the patient is delirious A third of affected people develop a macular rash on the trunk Intestinal haemorrhage due to bleeding in congested Peyers patches occurs this can be very serious but is usually not fatal Intestinal perforation in the distal ileum is a very serious complication and often fatal It may occur without alarming symptoms until septicaemia or diffuse peritonitis sets in Respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and acute bronchitis Encephalitis Neuropsychiatric symptoms described as muttering delirium or coma vigil with picking at bedclothes or imaginary objects Metastatic abscesses cholecystitis endocarditis and osteitis Low platelet count thrombocytopenia is sometimes seen
Symptoms vary based on the cause of the diseases For infectious causes of urethritis symptoms may start a few weeks to several months after infection Non infectious causes of urethritis commonly show symptoms after a few days Common symptoms include painful urination continuous urge to urinate itching and urethral discharge Additional symptoms vary based on assigned sex at birth AMAB assigned male at birth individuals may experience blood in the urine or semen itching tenderness or swelling of the penis enlarged lymph nodes in the groin area and or pain with intercourse or ejaculation AFAB assigned female at birth may experience abdominal pain pelvic pain pain with intercourse or vaginal discharge Non gonococcal urethritis typically does not have noticeable symptoms in AFAB individuals however the infection can spread to parts of the reproductive system
Although about 50 of women with BV are asymptomatic common symptoms include increased vaginal discharge that usually smells like fish The discharge is often white or gray in color There may be burning with urination Occasionally there may be no symptoms The discharge coats the walls of the vagina and is usually without significant irritation pain or erythema redness although mild itching can sometimes occur By contrast the normal vaginal discharge will vary in consistency and amount throughout the menstrual cycle and is at its clearest at ovulation about two weeks before the period starts Some practitioners claim that BV can be asymptomatic in almost half of affected women though others argue that this is often a misdiagnosis
There is great deal of variety in the symptoms associated with ventriculitis The symptoms vary based on a number of different factors including severity of inflammation underlying cause and the individual patient Patients often present with headaches painful cranial pressure and neck pain early in the progression of the disease Patients with a more advanced infection have been known to complain of many neurological effects such as dizziness vertigo confusion and slurred speech Very advanced cases can lead to mental instability nausea vomiting rigors and temporary loss of consciousness Many patients with ventriculitis also experience some degree of hydrocephalus which is the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid due to the inability of the ventricles to reabsorb and correctly circulate the fluid Brain abscess is another common disorder resulting from the inflammation If left untreated ventriculitis can lead to serious inhibition of mental function and even death The symptoms vary greatly in part because of the underlying or causing infection While the inflammation can cause a number of effects such as those mentioned previously the base infection could cause other symptoms that dont necessarily have to do with the ventriculitis itself One of the challenges doctors face in diagnosing ventriculitis is distinguishing indicative symptoms in spite of the wide variety of possible presentations of the disease A great deal of emphasis is being put on research into better and faster ways to diagnose ventriculitis without the delay inherent with microbiological testing of the cerebrospinal fluid The progression of the disease is also largely dependent on the nature of the specific case Depending on the underlying infection the way it entered the brain and the type and timing of treatment the infection may spread or withdraw on the order of months or days Ventriculitis is a very serious condition and should be treated early to ensure as little lasting damage as possible
In most cases vitamin D deficiency is almost asymptomatic It may only be detected on blood tests but is the cause of some bone diseases and is associated with other conditions
Signs of vitamin E deficiency include the following
Signs and symptoms of Waldenström macroglobulinemia include weakness fatigue weight loss and chronic oozing of blood from the nose and gums Peripheral neuropathy occurs in 10 of patients Enlargement of the lymph nodes spleen and or liver are present in 30 40 of cases Other possible signs and symptoms include blurring or loss of vision headache and rarely stroke or coma
The classic triad of symptoms found in Wernicke encephalopathy is ophthalmoplegia later expanded to other eye movement disorders most commonly affecting the lateral rectus muscle Lateral nystagmus is most commonly seen although lateral rectus palsy usually bilateral may be seen ataxia later expanded to imbalance or any cerebellar signs confusion later expanded to other mental changes Has 82 incidence in diagnosis cases However in actuality only a small percentage of patients experience all three symptoms and the full triad occurs more frequently among those who have overused alcohol Also a much more diverse range of symptoms has been found in patients with this condition including
Typical signs and symptoms of Wilms tumor include the following a painless palpable abdominal mass loss of appetite abdominal pain fever nausea and vomiting blood in the urine in about 20 of cases high blood pressure in some cases especially if synchronous or metachronous bilateral kidney involvement Rarely as varicocele

Hyposalivation may give the following signs and symptoms
Infection with Y enterocolitica can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the age of the person infected Common symptoms in children are fever abdominal pain and diarrhea which is often bloody Symptoms typically develop 4 to 7 days after exposure and may last 1 to 3 weeks or longer In older children and adults right sided abdominal pain and fever may be the predominant symptoms and may be confused with appendicitis In a small proportion of cases complications such as skin rash joint pains ileitis erythema nodosum and sometimes sepsis acute arthritis or the spread of bacteria to the bloodstream bacteremia can occur
Skin nails and hair Zinc deficiency may manifest as acne eczema xerosis dry scaling skin seborrheic dermatitis or alopecia thin and sparse hair It may also impair or possibly prevent wound healing
Patients with Zollinger Ellison syndrome may experience abdominal pain and diarrhea The diagnosis is also suspected in patients who have severe ulceration of the stomach and small bowel especially if they fail to respond to treatment Chronic diarrhea including steatorrhea fatty stools Pain in the esophagus especially between and after meals at night Nausea Wheezing Vomiting blood Malnourishment Loss of appetite MalabsorptionGastrinomas may occur as single tumors or as multiple small tumors About one half to two thirds of single gastrinomas are malignant tumors that most commonly spread to the liver and to lymph nodes near the pancreas and small bowel Nearly 25 percent of patients with gastrinomas have multiple tumors as part of a condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 MEN 1 MEN I patients have tumors in their pituitary gland and parathyroid glands in addition to tumors of the pancreas
SCAD often presents like a heart attack in young to middle aged healthy women This pattern usually includes chest pain rapid heartbeat shortness of breath sweating extreme tiredness nausea and dizziness A minority of people with SCAD may also present in cardiogenic shock 2 5 ventricular arrhythmias 3 11 or after sudden cardiac death Pregnancy and postpartum associated SCAD generally have worse outcomes compared to other cases
Complications Following are some complications of coagulopathies some of them caused by their treatments
Although the most obvious symptom is impairment of the limbs functioning is also impaired in the torso This can mean a loss or impairment in controlling bowel and bladder sexual function digestion breathing and other autonomic functions Furthermore sensation is usually impaired in affected areas This can manifest as numbness reduced sensation or burning neuropathic pain Secondarily because of their depressed functioning and immobility people with tetraplegia are often more vulnerable to pressure sores osteoporosis and fractures frozen joints spasticity respiratory complications and infections autonomic dysreflexia deep vein thrombosis and cardiovascular disease The severity of the condition depends on both the level at which the spinal cord is injured and the extent of the injury An individual with an injury at C1 the highest cervical vertebra at the base of the skull will probably lose function from the neck down and be ventilator dependent An individual with a C7 injury may lose function from the chest down but still retain use of the arms and much of the hands The extent of the injury is also important A complete severing of the spinal cord will result in complete loss of function from that vertebra down A partial severing or even bruising of the spinal cord results in varying degrees of mixed function and paralysis A common misconception with tetraplegia is that the victim cannot move legs arms or any of the major function this is often not the case Some individuals with tetraplegia can walk and use their hands as though they did not have a spinal cord injury while others may use wheelchairs and they can still have function of their arms and mild finger movement again that varies on the spinal cord damage It is common to have movement in limbs such as the ability to move the arms but not the hands or to be able to use the fingers but not to the same extent as before the injury Furthermore the deficit in the limbs may not be the same on both sides of the body either left or right side may be more affected depending on the location of the lesion on the spinal cord
Acute fractures will cause severe back pain Compression fractures which develop gradually such as in osteoporosis may initially not cause any symptoms but will later often lead to back pain and loss of height
Onset of symptoms is often gradual but in necrotizing staphylococcal or gram negative bacillary pneumonias patients can be acutely ill Cough fever with shivering and night sweats are often present Cough can be productive of foul smelling purulent mucus 70 or less frequently with blood in one third of cases Affected individuals may also complain of chest pain shortness of breath lethargy and other features of chronic illness Those with a lung abscess are generally cachectic at presentation Finger clubbing is present in one third of patients Dental decay is common especially in alcoholics and children On examination of the chest there will be features of consolidation such as localized dullness on percussion and bronchial breath sounds
The signs and symptoms of ischemia vary as it can occur anywhere in the body and depends on the degree to which blood flow is interrupted For example clinical manifestations of acute limb ischemia which can be summarized as the six Ps include pain pallor pulseless paresthesia paralysis and poikilothermia Without immediate intervention ischemia may progress quickly to tissue necrosis and gangrene within a few hours Paralysis is a very late sign of acute arterial ischemia and signals the death of nerves supplying the extremity Foot drop may occur as a result of nerve damage Because nerves are extremely sensitive to hypoxia limb paralysis or ischemic neuropathy may persist after revascularization and may be permanent
PAN may affect nearly every organ system and thus can present with a broad array of signs and symptoms These manifestations result from ischemic damage to affected organs often the skin heart kidneys and nervous system Constitutional symptoms are seen in up to 90 of affected individuals and include fever fatigue weakness loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss Skin The skin may show rashes swelling necrotic ulcers and subcutaneous nodules lumps Skin manifestations of PAN include palpable purpura and livedo reticularis in some individuals Neurologic system Nerve involvement may cause sensory changes with numbness pain burning and weakness peripheral neuropathy Peripheral nerves are often affected and this most commonly presents as mononeuritis multiplex which is the most common neurologic sign of PAN Mononeuritis multiplex develops in more than 70 of patients with polyarteritis nodosa because of damage to arteries supplying large peripheral nerves Most cases are marked by asymmetric polyneuropathy but progressive disease can lead to symmetric nerve involvement Central nervous system involvement may cause strokes or seizures Renal system Kidney involvement is common and often leads to death of parts of the kidney Involvement of the renal artery which supplies the kidneys with highly oxygenated blood often leads to high blood pressure in about one third of cases deposition of protein or blood in the urine may also be seen Almost all patients with PAN have renal insufficiency caused by renal artery narrowing thrombosis and infarctions Cardiovascular system Involvement of the arteries of the heart may cause a heart attack heart failure and inflammation of the sac around the heart pericarditis Gastrointestinal system Damage to mesenteric arteries can cause abdominal pain mesenteric ischemia and bowel perforation Abdominal pain may also be seen Musculoskeletal system Muscle and joint aches are common
Anemia may lead to fatigue pale skin severe bruising and a fast heart rate Low platelets are associated with an increased risk of bleeding bruising and petechiae with lower blood counts that impact the ability of the blood to clot Low white blood cells increase the risk of infections
Most cases of HCC occur in people who already have signs and symptoms of chronic liver disease They may present with worsening symptoms or without symptoms at the time of cancer detection HCC may present with non specific symptoms such as abdominal pain nausea vomiting or feeling tired Some symptoms that are more closely associated with liver disease include yellow skin also called jaundice abdominal swelling due to fluid in the abdominal cavity easy bruising from blood clotting abnormalities loss of appetite unintentional weight loss abdominal pain nausea vomiting or feeling tired
The signs and symptoms of clinical chorioamnionitis include fever leukocytosis 15 000 cells mm³ maternal 100 bpm or fetal 160 bpm tachycardia uterine tenderness and preterm rupture of membranes
Since the syndrome is due to the accumulation of chloramphenicol the signs and symptoms are dose related According to Kastens review published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings a serum concentration of more than 50 μg mL is a warning sign while Hammett Stabler and John states that the common therapeutics peak level is 10 20 μg mL and is expected to achieve after 0 5 1 5 hours of intravenous administration in their review of antimicrobial drugs The common onset of signs and symptoms are 2 to 9 days after the initiation of the medication which allows the serum concentration to build up to reach the toxic concentration above Common signs and symptoms include loss of appetite fussiness vomiting ashen gray color of the skin hypotension low blood pressure cyanosis blue discoloration of lips and skin hypothermia cardiovascular collapse hypotonia muscle stiffness abdominal distension irregular respiration and increased blood lactate
Acute symptoms The initial symptoms of pituitary apoplexy are related to the increased pressure in and around the pituitary gland The most common symptom in over 95 of cases is a sudden onset headache located behind the eyes or around the temples It is often associated with nausea and vomiting Occasionally the presence of blood leads to irritation of the lining of the brain which may cause neck rigidity and intolerance to bright light as well as a decreased level of consciousness This occurs in 24 of cases
The signs and symptoms of cholestasis vary according to the cause In case of sudden onset the disease is likely to be acute while the gradual appearance of symptoms suggests chronic pathology In many cases patients may experience pain in the abdominal area Localization of pain to the upper right quadrant can be indicative of cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis which can progress to cholestasis Pruritus or itching is often present in many patients with cholestasis Patients may present with visible scratch marks as a result of scratching Pruritus is often misdiagnosed as a dermatological condition especially in patients that do not have jaundice as an accompanying symptom In a typical day pruritus worsens as the day progresses particularly during the evening time Overnight pruritus dramatically improves This cycle can be attributed to an increase in the concentration of biliary elements during the day due to food consumption and a decline at night Pruritus is mostly localized to the limbs but can also be more generalized The efficacy of naltrexone for cholestatic pruritus suggests involvement of the endogenous opioid system Many patients may experience jaundice as a result of cholestasis This is usually evident after physical examination as yellow pigment deposits on the skin in the oral mucosa or conjunctiva Jaundice is an uncommon occurrence in intrahepatic metabolic cholestasis but is common in obstructive cholestasis The majority of patients with chronic cholestasis also experience fatigue This is likely a result of defects in the corticotrophin hormone axis or other abnormalities with neurotransmission Some patients may also have xanthomas which are fat deposits that accumulate below the skin These usually appear waxy and yellow predominantly around the eyes and joints This condition results from an accumulation of lipids within the blood If gallstones prevent bile flowing from the pancreas to the small intestine it can lead to gallstone pancreatitis Physical symptoms include nausea vomiting and abdominal pain Bile is required for the absorption of fat soluble vitamins As such patients with cholestasis may present with a deficiency in vitamins A D E or K due to a decline in bile flow Patients with cholestasis may also experience pale stool and dark urine
Signs and symptoms of typhlitis may include diarrhea a distended abdomen fever chills nausea vomiting and abdominal pain or tenderness
Colorectal polyps are not usually associated with symptoms When they occur symptoms include bloody stools changes in frequency or consistency of stools such as a week or more of constipation or diarrhoea and fatigue arising from blood loss Anemia arising from iron deficiency can also present due to chronic blood loss even in the absence of bloody stools Another symptom may be an increased mucus production especially those involving villous adenomas Copious production of mucous causes loss of potassium that can occasionally result in symptomatic hypokalemia Occasionally if a polyp is big enough to cause a bowel obstruction there may be nausea vomiting and severe constipation
The most common manifestation of lymphedema is soft tissue swelling edema As the disorder progresses worsening edema and skin changes including discoloration verrucous wart like hyperplasia hyperkeratosis papillomatosis dermal thickening and ulcers may be seen Additionally there is increased risk of infection of the skin known as Erysipelas
Adults The most common symptoms of GERD in adults are an acidic taste in the mouth regurgitation and heartburn Less common symptoms include pain with swallowing sore throat increased salivation also known as water brash nausea chest pain coughing and globus sensation The acid reflux can induce asthma attack symptoms like shortness of breath cough and wheezing in those with underlying asthma GERD sometimes causes injury to the esophagus These injuries may include one or more of the following
Salicylate toxicity has potentially serious consequences sometimes leading to significant morbidity and death Patients with mild intoxication frequently have nausea and vomiting abdominal pain lethargy ringing in the ears and dizziness More significant signs and symptoms occur in more severe poisonings and include high body temperature fast breathing rate respiratory alkalosis metabolic acidosis low blood potassium low blood glucose hallucinations confusion seizure cerebral edema and coma The most common cause of death following an aspirin overdose is cardiopulmonary arrest usually due to pulmonary edema High doses of salicylate can cause salicylate induced tinnitus
Renal osteodystrophy may exhibit no symptoms if it does show symptoms they include
Signs and symptoms include hypoglycemia hyperpigmentation dehydration weight loss and disorientation Additional signs and symptoms include weakness tiredness dizziness low blood pressure that falls further when standing orthostatic hypotension cardiovascular collapse muscle aches nausea vomiting and diarrhea These problems may develop gradually and insidiously Addisons disease can present with tanning of the skin that may be patchy or even all over the body Characteristic sites of tanning are skin creases e g of the hands and the inside of the cheek buccal mucosa Goitre and vitiligo may also be present Eosinophilia may also occur Hyponatremia is a sign of secondary insufficiency
The cause of HCM is variable Many people are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and many of those carrying disease genes for HCM do not have clinically detectable disease The symptoms of HCM include shortness of breath due to stiffening and decreased blood filling of the ventricles exertional chest pain sometimes known as angina due to reduced blood flow to the coronary arteries uncomfortable awareness of the heart beat palpitations as well as disruption of the electrical system running through the abnormal heart muscle lightheadedness weakness fainting and sudden cardiac death Shortness of breath is largely due to increased stiffness of the left ventricle LV which impairs filling of the ventricles but also leads to elevated pressure in the left ventricle and left atrium causing back pressure and interstitial congestion in the lungs Symptoms are not closely related to the presence or severity of an outflow tract gradient Often symptoms mimic those of congestive heart failure esp activity intolerance and dyspnea but treatment of each is different Beta blockers are used in both cases but treatment with diuretics a mainstay of CHF treatment will exacerbate symptoms in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy by decreasing ventricular preload volume and thereby increasing outflow resistance less blood to push aside the thickened obstructing tissue Major risk factors for sudden death in individuals with HCM include prior history of cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia abnormal exercise blood pressure and non sustained ventricular tachycardia unexplained syncope family history of premature sudden death and LVW thickness greater than 15 mm to 30 mm on echocardiogram Spike and dome pulse and triple ripple apical impulse are two other signs that can be discovered in physical examination
The anti glomerular basement membrane GBM antibodies primarily attack the kidneys and lungs although generalized symptoms like malaise weight loss fatigue fever and chills are also common as are joint aches and pains 60 to 80 of those with the condition experience both lung and kidney involvement 20 40 have kidney involvement alone and less than 10 have lung involvement alone Lung symptoms usually antedate kidney symptoms and usually include coughing up blood chest pain in less than 50 of cases overall cough and shortness of breath Kidney symptoms usually include blood in the urine protein in the urine unexplained swelling of limbs or face high amounts of urea in the blood and high blood pressure
Symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis are mainly Shortness of breath particularly with exertion Chronic dry hacking coughing Fatigue and weakness Chest discomfort including chest pain Loss of appetite and rapid weight lossPulmonary fibrosis is suggested by a history of progressive shortness of breath dyspnea with exertion Sometimes fine inspiratory crackles can be heard at the lung bases on auscultation A chest X ray may or may not be abnormal but high resolution CT will frequently demonstrate abnormalities
Those with diseases or dysfunctions of their nerves may present with problems in any of the normal nerve functions Symptoms vary depending on the types of nerve fiber involved In terms of sensory function symptoms commonly include loss of function negative symptoms including numbness tremor impairment of balance and gait abnormality Gain of function positive symptoms include tingling pain itching crawling and pins and needles Motor symptoms include loss of function negative symptoms of weakness tiredness muscle atrophy and gait abnormalities and gain of function positive symptoms of cramps and muscle twitch fasciculations In the most common form length dependent peripheral neuropathy pain and parasthesia appears symmetrically and generally at the terminals of the longest nerves which are in the lower legs and feet Sensory symptoms generally develop before motor symptoms such as weakness Length dependent peripheral neuropathy symptoms make a slow ascent of the lower limbs while symptoms may never appear in the upper limbs if they do it will be around the time that leg symptoms reach the knee When the nerves of the autonomic nervous system are affected symptoms may include constipation dry mouth difficulty urinating and dizziness when standing
The first skin changes in calciphylaxis lesions are mottling of the skin and induration in a livedo reticularis pattern As tissue thrombosis and infarction occurs a black leathery eschar in an ulcer with adherent black slough develops Surrounding the ulcers is usually a plate like area of indurated skin These lesions are always extremely painful and most often occur on the lower extremities abdomen buttocks and penis Lesions are also commonly multiple and bilateral Because the tissue has infarcted wound healing seldom occurs and ulcers are more likely to become secondarily infected Many cases of calciphylaxis lead to systemic bacterial infection and death Calciphylaxis is characterized by the following histologic findings
Gastrointestinal manifestations Depending on the nature of the disease process causing malabsorption and its extent gastrointestinal symptoms may range from severe to subtle or may even be totally absent Diarrhea weight loss flatulence abdominal bloating abdominal cramps and pain may be present Although diarrhea is a common complaint the character and frequency of stools may vary considerably ranging from over 10 watery stools per day to less than one voluminous putty like stool the latter causing some patients to complain of constipation On the other hand stool mass is invariably increased in patients with steatorrhea and generalized malabsorption above the normal with 150 200 g day Not only do unabsorbed nutrients contribute to stool mass but mucosal fluid and electrolyte secretion is also increased in diseases associated with mucosal inflammation such as coeliac disease In addition unabsorbed fatty acids converted to hydroxy fatty acids by colonic flora as well as unabsorbed bile acids both impair absorption and induce secretion of water and electrolytes by the colon adding to stool mass Weight loss is common among patients with significant intestinal malabsorption but must be evaluated in the context of caloric intake Some patients compensate for fecal wastage of unabsorbed nutrients by significantly increasing their oral intake Eliciting a careful dietary history from patients with suspected malabsorption is therefore crucial Excessive flatus and abdominal bloating may reflect excessive gas production due to fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrate especially among patients with a primary or secondary disaccharidase deficiency such as lactose intolerance or sucrose intolerance Malabsorption of dietary nutrients and excessive fluid secretion by inflamed small intestine also contribute to abdominal distention and bloating Prevalence severity and character of abdominal pain vary considerably among the various disease processes associated with intestinal malabsorption For example pain is common in patients with chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer and Crohns disease but it is absent in many patients with coeliac disease or postgastrectomy malabsorption
Stupor is characterised by impaired reaction to external stimuli Those in a stuporous state are rigid mute and only appear to be conscious as the eyes are open and follow surrounding objects If not stimulated externally a patient with stupor will appear to be in a sleepy state most of the time In some extreme cases of severe depressive disorders the patient can become motionless lose their appetite and become mute Short periods of restricted responsivity can be achieved by intense stimulation e g pain bright light loud noise shock
The presentation of a patient with catatonia varies greatly depending on the subtype underlying cause and it can be acute or subtle Because most patients with catatonia have an underlying psychiatric illness the majority will present with worsening depression mania or psychosis followed by catatonia symptoms Catatonia presents as a motor disturbance in which patients will display marked reduction in movement marked agitation or a mixture of both despite having the physical capacity to move normally These patients may be unable to start an action or stop one Movements and mannerisms may be repetitive or purposeless The most common signs of catatonia are immobility mutism withdrawal and refusal to eat staring negativism posturing rigidity rigidity waxy flexibility catalepsy stereotypy purposeless repetitive movements echolalia or echopraxia verbigeration repeat meaningless phrases It should not be assumed that patients presenting with catatonia are unaware of their surroundings as some patients can recall in detail their catatonic state and their actions There are several subtypes of catatonia and they are characterized by the specific movement disturbance and associated features Although catatonia can be divided into various subtypes the natural history of catatonia is often fluctuant and different states can exist within the same individual
Three progressive phases of ischemic colitis have been described A hyperactive phase occurs first in which the primary symptoms are severe abdominal pain and the passage of bloody stools Many patients get better and do not progress beyond this phase A paralytic phase can follow if ischemia continues in this phase the abdominal pain becomes more widespread the belly becomes more tender to the touch and bowel motility decreases resulting in abdominal bloating no further bloody stools and absent bowel sounds on exam Finally a shock phase can develop as fluids start to leak through the damaged colon lining This can result in shock and metabolic acidosis with dehydration low blood pressure rapid heart rate and confusion Patients who progress to this phase are often critically ill and require intensive care Symptoms of ischemic colitis vary depending on the severity of the ischemia The most common early signs of ischemic colitis include abdominal pain often left sided with mild to moderate amounts of rectal bleeding The sensitivity of findings among 73 patients were abdominal pain 78 lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding 62 diarrhea 38 Fever higher than 38 C 100 4 F 34 Physical examination abdominal pain 77 abdominal tenderness 21
Nearly half of people with PSC do not have symptoms and are often incidentally discovered to have PSC due to abnormal liver function tests however a substantial proportion have debilitating signs and symptoms of the disease Signs and symptoms of PSC may include severe itching and nonspecific fatigue Yellowing of the skin and white portion of the eyes may also be seen Enlargement of the liver and spleen are seen in roughly 40 of affected individuals Abdominal pain affects about 20 of people with PSC Multiple episodes of life threatening acute cholangitis infection within the bile ducts can be seen due to impaired drainage of the bile ducts which increases the risk of infection Dark urine due to excess conjugated bilirubin which is water soluble and excreted by the kidneys i e choluria Malabsorption especially of fat and steatorrhea fatty stool due to an inadequate amount of bile reaching the small intestine leading to decreased levels of the fat soluble vitamins A D E and K Portal hypertension a complication of cirrhosis which can manifest with esophageal and parastomal varices as well as hepatic encephalopathy mental status alteration disturbance caused by liver dysfunction and shunting of blood away from the scarred liver such that ammonia detoxification is reduced with concomitant encephalopathy or ascites
Pain is the most common presenting symptom It is usually described as sharp crampy dull or severe right upper quadrant pain which may radiate to the right shoulder or less commonly behind the breastbone Nausea and vomiting can be associated with biliary colic Individuals may also present with pain that is induced following a fatty meal and the symptom of indigestion The pain often lasts longer than 30 minutes up to a few hours Patients usually have normal vital signs with biliary colic whereas patients with cholecystitis are usually febrile and more ill appearing Lab studies that should be ordered include a complete blood count liver function tests and lipase In biliary colic lab findings are usually within normal limits Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase are usually suggestive of liver disease whereas elevation of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase suggests common bile duct obstruction Pancreatitis should be considered if the lipase value is elevated gallstone disease is the major cause of pancreatitis
After eating contaminated food the first symptoms of infection can emerge anywhere from 1 to 10 days later but usually after 3 to 4 days These early symptoms can include diarrhea which is often bloody stomach cramps mild fever or vomiting that results in dehydration and reduced urine HUS typically develops about 5 10 days after the first symptoms but can take up to 3 weeks to manifest and occurs at a time when the diarrhea is improving Related symptoms and signs include lethargy decreased urine output blood in the urine kidney failure low platelets which are needed for blood clotting and destruction of red blood cells microangiopathic hemolytic anemia High blood pressure jaundice a yellow tinge in skin and the whites of the eyes seizures and bleeding into the skin can also occur In some cases there are prominent neurologic changes People with HUS commonly exhibit the symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy TMA which can include abdominal pain low platelet count elevated lactate dehydrogenase LDH a chemical released from damaged cells and which is therefore a marker of cellular damage decreased haptoglobin indicative of the breakdown of red blood cells anemia low red blood cell count schistocytes damaged red blood cells elevated creatinine a protein waste product generated by muscle metabolism and eliminated renally proteinuria indicative of kidney injury confusion fatigue swelling nausea vomiting and diarrhea Additionally patients with aHUS typically present with an abrupt onset of systemic signs and symptoms such as acute kidney failure hypertension high blood pressure myocardial infarction heart attack stroke lung complications pancreatitis inflammation of the pancreas liver necrosis death of liver cells or tissue encephalopathy brain dysfunction seizure and coma Failure of neurologic cardiac renal and gastrointestinal GI organs as well as death can occur unpredictably at any time either very quickly or following prolonged symptomatic or asymptomatic disease progression
May have no signs and symptoms or they may include cough but not prominent chest pain not common breathing difficulty fast and shallow low oxygen saturation pleural effusion transudate type cyanosis late sign increased heart rate It is a common misconception and pure speculation that atelectasis causes fever A study of 100 post op patients followed with serial chest X rays and temperature measurements showed that the incidence of fever decreased as the incidence of atelectasis increased A recent review article summarizing the available published evidence on the association between atelectasis and post op fever concluded that there is no clinical evidence supporting this speculation
Signs and symptoms of preterm labor include four or more uterine contractions in one hour In contrast to false labour true labor is accompanied by cervical dilatation and effacement Also vaginal bleeding in the third trimester heavy pressure in the pelvis or abdominal or back pain could be indicators that a preterm birth is about to occur A watery discharge from the vagina may indicate premature rupture of the membranes that surround the baby While the rupture of the membranes may not be followed by labor usually delivery is indicated as infection chorioamnionitis is a serious threat to both fetus and mother In some cases the cervix dilates prematurely without pain or perceived contractions so that the mother may not have warning signs until very late in the birthing process
The typical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is chest pain with or without shortness of breath and associated electrocardiogram ECG changes mimicking a myocardial infarction of the anterior wall During the course of evaluation of the patient a bulging out of the left ventricular apex with a hypercontractile base of the left ventricle is often noted It is the hallmark bulging out of the apex of the heart with preserved function of the base that earned the syndrome its name takotsubo octopus trap in Japan where it was first described Stress is the main factor in takotsubo cardiomyopathy with more than 85 of cases set in motion by either a physically or emotionally stressful event that prefaces the start of symptoms Examples of emotional stressors include grief from the death of a loved one fear of public speaking arguing with a spouse relationship disagreements betrayal and financial problems Acute asthma surgery chemotherapy and stroke are examples of physical stressors In a few cases the stress may be a happy event such as a wedding winning a jackpot a sporting triumph or a birthday
The clinical presentation of AIP is highly variable and non specific The patients are typically asymptomatic with most gene carriers having no family history because the condition had remained latent for several generations The syndrome marked by acute attacks affects only 10 of gene carriers The mean age at diagnosis is 33 years old Like other porphyrias AIP is more likely to present in women A distinguishing feature of AIP that separates it from other porphyrias is the absence of photosensitive cutaneous symptoms that occur in addition to acute attacks
Signs and symptoms of cauda equina syndrome include Severe back pain Saddle anesthesia see diagram i e anesthesia or paraesthesia involving S3 to S5 dermatomes 26 including the perineum external genitalia and anus or more descriptively numbness or pins and needles sensations of the groin and inner thighs which would contact a saddle when riding a horse Bladder and bowel dysfunction 216 caused by decreased tone of the urinary and anal sphincters Detrusor weaknesses causing urinary retention and post void residual incontinence as assessed by bladder scanning the patient after the patient has urinated Sciatica type pain on one side or both sides although pain may be wholly absent Weakness of the muscles of the lower legs often paraplegia Achilles ankle reflex absent on both sides 216 Sexual dysfunction Absent anal reflex and bulbocavernosus reflex Gait disturbanceSevere back pain saddle anesthesia urinary or fecal incontinence and sexual dysfunction are considered red flags i e features which require urgent investigation
Facial nerve paralysis is characterised by facial weakness usually only in one side of the face with other symptoms possibly including loss of taste hyperacusis and decreased salivation and tear secretion Other signs may be linked to the cause of the paralysis such as vesicles in the ear which may occur if the facial palsy is due to shingles Symptoms may develop over several hours 1228 Acute facial pain radiating from the ear may precede the onset of other symptoms 2585
The average age of diagnosis is between 35 and 50 years This is about 5 to 10 years older than men with other germ cell tumors of the testes In most cases they produce masses that are readily felt on testicular self examination however in up to 11 percent of cases there may be no mass able to be felt or there may be testicular atrophy Testicular pain is reported in up to one fifth of cases Low back pain may occur after metastasis to the retroperitoneum Some cases of seminoma can present as a primary tumour outside the testis most commonly in the mediastinum In the ovary the tumor is called a dysgerminoma and in non gonadal sites particularly the central nervous system it is called a germinoma
Cardiac arrest is not preceded by any warning symptoms in approximately 50 percent of people For individuals who do experience symptoms the symptoms are usually nonspecific to the cardiac arrest This can present in the form of new or worsening
The two most common signs and symptoms of bone marrow failure are bleeding and bruising Blood may be seen throughout the gums nose or the skin and tend to last longer than normal Children have a bigger chance of seeing blood in their urine or stools which results in digestive problems with an unpleasant scent Individuals with this condition may also encounter tooth loss or tooth decay Chronic fatigue shortness of breath and recurrent colds can also be symptoms of bone marrow failure
Course The onset of psychiatric disorders usually occurs from childhood to early adulthood Impulse control disorders and a few anxiety disorders tend to appear in childhood Some other anxiety disorders substance disorders and mood disorders emerge later in the mid teens Symptoms of schizophrenia typically manifest from late adolescence to early twenties The likely course and outcome of mental disorders vary and are dependent on numerous factors related to the disorder itself the individual as a whole and the social environment Some disorders may last a brief period of time while others may be long term in nature All disorders can have a varied course Long term international studies of schizophrenia have found that over a half of individuals recover in terms of symptoms and around a fifth to a third in terms of symptoms and functioning with many requiring no medication While some have serious difficulties and support needs for many years late recovery is still plausible The World Health Organization WHO concluded that the long term studies findings converged with others in relieving patients carers and clinicians of the chronicity paradigm which dominated thinking throughout much of the 20th century A follow up study by Tohen and coworkers revealed that around half of people initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder achieve symptomatic recovery no longer meeting criteria for the diagnosis within six weeks and nearly all achieve it within two years with nearly half regaining their prior occupational and residential status in that period Less than half go on to experience a new episode of mania or major depression within the next two years
Within a few days of onset there are chills with rigor high fever jaundice vomiting rapidly progressive anemia and dark red or black urine
The long term and short term effects of cannabis use are associated with behavioral effects leading to a wide variety of effects on the body systems and physiological states CHS is a paradoxical syndrome characterized by hyperemesis persistent vomiting as opposed to the better known antiemetic properties of cannabinoids Specifically CHS takes the pattern of cyclical nausea vomiting and abdominal pain in the setting of chronic cannabinoid use The abdominal pain tends to be mild and diffused There are three phases of CHS the prodromal phase the hyperemetic phase and the recovery phase
FI affects virtually all aspects of peoples lives greatly diminishing physical and mental health and affecting personal social and professional life Emotional effects may include stress fearfulness anxiety exhaustion fear of public humiliation feeling dirty poor body image reduced desire for sex anger humiliation depression isolation secrecy frustration and embarrassment Some people may need to be in control of life outside of FI as means of compensation The physical symptoms such as skin soreness pain and odor may also affect quality of life Physical activity such as shopping or exercise is often affected Travel may be affected requiring careful planning Working is also affected for most Relationships social activities and self image likewise often suffer Symptoms may worsen over time
Although lichen planus can present with a variety of lesions the most common presentation is as a well defined area of purple coloured itchy flat topped papules with interspersed lacy white lines Wickhams striae This description is known as the characteristic 6 Ps of lichen planus planar flat topped purple polygonal pruritic papules and plaques This rash after regressing is likely to leave an area of hyperpigmentation that slowly fades That said a variety of other lesions can also occur
Most women will experience a painless leakage of fluid out of the vagina They may notice either a distinct gush or a steady flow of small amounts of watery fluid in the absence of steady uterine contractions Loss of fluid may be associated with the baby becoming easier to feel through the belly due to the loss of the surrounding fluid decreased uterine size or meconium fetal stool seen in the fluid
The signs and symptoms of milk alkali syndrome can develop after only a few days and up to several months following the initial ingestion of absorbable calcium and alkali However the severity of signs and symptoms of milk alkali syndrome is largely dependent upon the duration and quantity of calcium and alkali ingested Acute milk alkali syndrome is characterized by several biochemical alterations mainly alkalosis hypochloremia hypokalemia and hypercalcemia In the acute phase of milk alkali syndrome Cope syndrome the first symptoms of toxicity are nausea vomiting anorexia headache dizziness vertigo apathy weakness confusion irritability dry mouth and repulsion to milk In individuals with chronic milk alkali syndrome Burnett syndrome symptoms may include muscle aches psychosis tremor polyuria producing large volumes of dilute urine polydipsia intense thirst pruritus itchy sensation on skin band keratopathy and abnormal calcifications These abnormal calcium deposits often collect metastatically in the body including throughout the periarticular tissue subcutaneous tissue central nervous system liver kidneys adrenal bones and lungs If ingestion of calcium and alkali is continued neurologic symptoms such as memory loss personality changes lethargy stupor and coma will persistently develop over time as a result of the extreme hypercalcemia and electrolyte imbalances People with milk alkali syndrome commonly show signs of renal dysfunction a hallmark symptom of milk alkali syndrome at early stages of disease progression Several lab test results such as elevated blood urea nitrogen BUN and elevated creatinine are illustrative of azotemia and kidney impairment Histologically the kidneys of individuals with milk alkali syndrome have been shown to have complete glomerulus hyalinization thickening of the Bowmans capsule tubular atrophy vascular changes and diffuse lymphocytic infiltration Other laboratory tests such as measuring serum bicarbonate pH 1 25 OH vitamin D and parathyroid hormone PTH can show signs of milk alkali syndrome Specifically bicarbonate and pH would be elevated while 1 25 OH vitamin D and PTH would be suppressed
Aseptic meningitis is a disease that can depend on the patients age however research has shown some distinct symptoms that indicate the possibility of aseptic meningitis A variety of patients notice a change in body temperatures higher than normal temperatures 38 40 C marked with the possibility of vomiting headaches firm neck pain and even lack of appetite In younger patients like babies a meningeal inflammation can be noticed along with the possibility of hepatic necrosis and myocarditis In serious cases a multiple organ failure can also signal aseptic meningitis and oftentimes in babies seizures and focal neurological deficits can be early symptoms of aseptic meningitis In fact in newborns the mortality rate is 70 The next set of age group like children have similar but varying symptoms of sore throat rashes and diarrhea In adults symptoms and the harshness of them tend to be less in duration Additionally the probability of developing aseptic meningitis increases when patients have a case of mumps or herpes Symptoms of meningitis caused by an acute viral infection last between one and two weeks When aseptic meningitis is caused by cytomegalovirus 20 percent of individuals face mortality or morbidity If left untreated it can affect an individuals hearing and learning abilities
Often there are no or few symptoms Occasionally there may be tiredness or pain in the upper right side of the abdomen
Clinical features NME features a characteristic skin eruption of red patches with irregular borders intact and ruptured vesicles and crust formation It commonly affects the limbs and skin surrounding the lips although less commonly the abdomen perineum thighs buttocks and groin may be affected Frequently these areas may be left dry or fissured as a result All stages of lesion development may be observed synchronously The initial eruption may be exacerbated by pressure or trauma to the affected areas
Symptoms of a rupture may be initially quite subtle An old cesarean scar may undergo dehiscence with further labor the woman may experience abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding though these signs are difficult to distinguish from normal labor Often a deterioration of the fetal heart rate is a leading sign but the cardinal sign of uterine rupture is loss of fetal station on manual vaginal exam Intra abdominal bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock and death Although the associated maternal mortality is now less than one percent the fetal mortality rate is between two and six percent when rupture occurs in the hospital In pregnancy uterine rupture may cause a viable abdominal pregnancy This is what accounts for most abdominal pregnancy births
The defining symptom of pleurisy is a sudden sharp stabbing burning or dull pain in the right or left side of the chest during breathing especially when one inhales and exhales It feels worse with deep breathing coughing sneezing or laughing The pain may stay in one place or it may spread to the shoulder or back Sometimes it becomes a fairly constant dull ache Depending on its cause pleuritic chest pain may be accompanied by other symptoms Dry cough Fever and chills Rapid shallow breathing Shortness of breath Fast heart rate Sore throat followed by pain and swelling in the joints
Many patients first complain of pain that may be worse at night may be intermittent and of varying intensity and may have been occurring for a long time Teenagers who are active in sports often complain of pain in the lower femur or immediately below the knee If the tumor is large it can present as overt localised swelling Sometimes a sudden fracture is the first symptom because the affected bone is not as strong as normal bone and may fracture abnormally with minor trauma In cases of more deep seated tumors that are not as close to the skin such as those originating in the pelvis localised swelling may not be apparent
Signs and symptoms of respiratory alkalosis are as follows Palpitation Tetany Convulsion Sweating
There are different signs and symptoms associated with testicular atrophy depending on the persons age Symptoms before puberty are centered more around the stunting of sexual characteristics associated with hormonal changes while symptoms after puberty include a wider range of factors Other signs and symptoms may stem from underlying conditions which cause testicular atrophy The most perceptible sign of testicular atrophy is shrinkage of the testicle s Signs and symptoms before puberty include

Vertigo is a sensation of spinning while stationary It is commonly associated with nausea or vomiting unsteadiness postural instability falls changes to a persons thoughts and difficulties in walking Recurrent episodes in those with vertigo are common and frequently impair the quality of life Blurred vision difficulty in speaking a lowered level of consciousness and hearing loss may also occur The signs and symptoms of vertigo can present as a persistent insidious onset or an episodic sudden onset Persistent onset vertigo is characterized by symptoms lasting for longer than one day and is caused by degenerative changes that affect balance as people age Naturally the nerve conduction slows with aging and a decreased vibratory sensation is common Additionally there is a degeneration of the ampulla and otolith organs with an increase in age Persistent onset is commonly paired with central vertigo signs and symptoms The characteristics of an episodic onset vertigo are indicated by symptoms lasting for a smaller more memorable amount of time typically lasting for only seconds to minutes
Signs and symptoms vary depending on what part of the tracheobronchial tree is injured and how severely it is damaged There are no direct signs of TBI but certain signs suggest the injury and raise a clinicians suspicion that it has occurred Many of the signs and symptoms are also present in injuries with similar injury mechanisms such as pneumothorax Dyspnea and respiratory distress are found in 76 100 of people with TBI and coughing up blood has been found in up to 25 However isolated TBI does not usually cause profuse bleeding if such bleeding is observed it is likely to be due to another injury such as a ruptured large blood vessel The patient may exhibit dysphonia or have diminished breath sounds and rapid breathing is common Coughing may be present and stridor an abnormal high pitched breath sound indicating obstruction of the upper airway can also occur Damage to the airways can cause subcutaneous emphysema air trapped in the subcutaneous tissue of the skin in the abdomen chest neck and head Subcutaneous emphysema present in up to 85 of people with TBI is particularly indicative of the injury when it is only in the neck Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs pneumothorax in about 70 of TBI Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum the center of the chest cavity pneumomediastinum If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made Hammans sign a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat may also accompany TBI
At birth the inner layer of the foreskin is sealed to the glans penis The foreskin is usually non retractable in early childhood and some males may reach the age of 18 before their foreskin can be fully retracted Medical associations advise not to retract the foreskin of an infant in order to prevent scarring Some argue that non retractability may be considered normal for males up to and including adolescence Hill states that full retractability of the foreskin may not be achieved until late childhood or early adulthood A Danish survey found that the mean age of first foreskin retraction is 10 4 years Rickwood as well as other authors has suggested that true phimosis is over diagnosed due to failure to distinguish between normal developmental non retractability and a pathological condition Some authors use the terms physiologic and pathologic to distinguish between these types of phimosis others use the term non retractile foreskin to distinguish this developmental condition from pathologic phimosis In some cases a cause may not be clear or it may be difficult to distinguish physiological phimosis from pathological phimosis if an infant appears to have discomfort while urinating or demonstrates obvious ballooning of the foreskin However ballooning does not indicate urinary obstruction In women a comparable condition is known as clitoral phimosis whereby the clitoral hood cannot be retracted limiting exposure of the glans clitoridis
Symptoms of an ingrown nail include pain along the margins of the nail caused by hypergranulation that occurs around the aforementioned margins worsening of pain when wearing tight footwear and sensitivity to pressure of any kind even the weight of bedsheets Bumping of an affected toe can produce sharp and even excruciating pain as the tissue is punctured further by the nail By the very nature of the condition ingrown nails become easily infected unless special care is taken early to treat the condition by keeping the area clean Signs of infection include redness and swelling of the area around the nail drainage of pus and watery discharge tinged with blood The main symptom is swelling at the base of the nail on the ingrowing side though it may be both sides Onychocryptosis should not be confused with a similar nail disorder convex nail nor with other painful conditions such as involuted nails nor with the presence of small corns callus or debris down the nail sulci grooves on either side

Porphyria cutanea tarda PCT is recognized as the most prevalent subtype of porphyritic diseases PCT is characterized by onycholysis and blistering of the skin in areas that receive higher levels of exposure to sunlight The primary cause is a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase UROD a cytosolic enzyme that is a step in the enzymatic pathway that leads to the synthesis of heme Behind the direct cause there are a number of genetic and environmental risk factors Patients who are diagnosed with PCT typically seek treatment following the development of photosensitivities causing blisters and erosions on exposed areas of the skin This is usually observed in the face hands forearms and lower legs Healing is slow and leaves scarring Though blisters are the most common skin manifestations of PCT other skin manifestations include hyperpigmentation similar to a tan and hypertrichosis mainly on the cheeks also occur PCT is a chronic condition with external symptoms often subsiding and recurring as a result of multiple factors In addition to the skin lesions chronic liver disease is very common in patients with sporadic PCT This involves hepatic fibrosis scarring of the liver and inflammation However liver problems are less common in patients with the inherited form of the disease Additionally patients will often void a wine red color urine with an increased concentration of uroporphyrin I due to their enzymatic deficiency
The most common symptom is craving for dopaminergic medication However other behavioral symptoms can appear independently of craving or co occur with it Craving is an intense impulse of the subject to obtain medication even in the absence of symptoms that indicate its intake To fulfill this need the person will self administer extra doses When self administration is not possible aggressive outbursts or the use of strategies such as symptom simulation or bribery to access additional medication can also appear Hypomania manifesting with feelings of euphoria omnipotence or grandiosity are prone to appear in those moments when medication effects are maximum dysphoria characterized by sadness psychomotor slowing fatigue or apathy are typical with dopamine replacement therapy DRT withdrawal Different impulse control disorders have been described including gambling compulsive shopping eating disorders and hypersexuality Behavioral disturbances most commonly aggressive tendencies are the norm Psychosis is also common

The symptoms of rhabdomyolysis depend on its severity and whether kidney failure develops Milder forms may not cause any muscle symptoms and the diagnosis is based on abnormal blood tests in the context of other problems More severe rhabdomyolysis is characterized by muscle pain tenderness weakness and swelling of the affected muscles If the swelling is very rapid as may happen with a crush injury after someone is released from under heavy collapsed debris the movement of fluid from the bloodstream into damaged muscle may cause low blood pressure and shock Other symptoms are nonspecific and result either from the consequences of muscle tissue breakdown or from the condition that originally led to the muscle breakdown Release of the components of muscle tissue into the bloodstream causes electrolyte disturbances which can lead to nausea vomiting confusion coma or abnormal heart rate and rhythm The urine may be dark often described as tea colored due to the presence of myoglobin Damage to the kidneys may give rise to decreased or absent urine production usually 12 to 24 hours after the initial muscle damage Swelling of damaged muscle occasionally leads to compartment syndrome compression of surrounding tissues such as nerves and blood vessels in the same fascial compartment leading to the loss of blood supply and damage or loss of function in the part s of the body supplied by these structures Symptoms of this complication include pain or reduced sensation in the affected limb A second recognized complication is disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC a severe disruption in blood clotting that may lead to uncontrollable bleeding
Photodermatitis may result in swelling difficulty breathing a burning sensation a red itchy rash sometimes resembling small blisters and peeling of the skin Nausea may also occur There may also be blotches where the itching may persist for long periods of time In these areas an unsightly orange to brown tint may form usually near or on the face
A few described symptoms
Most intact aortic aneurysms do not produce symptoms As they enlarge symptoms such as abdominal pain and back pain may develop Compression of nerve roots may cause leg pain or numbness Untreated aneurysms tend to become progressively larger although the rate of enlargement is unpredictable for any individual Rarely clotted blood which lines most aortic aneurysms can break off and result in an embolus Aneurysms cannot be found on physical examination Medical imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the anatomic extent of the aneurysm In patients presenting with aneurysm of the arch of the aorta a common sign is a hoarse voice from stretching of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve a branch of the vagus nerve that winds around the aortic arch to supply the muscles of the larynx
Signs and symptoms may include a limp or paralyzed arm lack of muscle control in the arm hand or wrist and lack of feeling or sensation in the arm or hand Although several mechanisms account for brachial plexus injuries the most common is nerve compression or stretch Infants in particular may experience brachial plexus injuries during delivery and these present with typical patterns of weakness depending on which portion of the brachial plexus is involved The most severe form of injury is nerve root avulsion which usually accompanies high velocity impacts that commonly occur during motor vehicle collisions or bicycle accidents

Intellectual disability ID becomes apparent during childhood and involves deficits in mental abilities social skills and core activities of daily living ADLs when compared to same aged peers There often are no physical signs of mild forms of ID although there may be characteristic physical traits when it is associated with a genetic disorder e g Down syndrome The level of impairment ranges in severity for each person Some of the early signs can include Delays in reaching or failure to achieve milestones in motor skills development sitting crawling walking Slowness learning to talk or continued difficulties with speech and language skills after starting to talk Difficulty with self help and self care skills e g getting dressed washing and feeding themselves Poor planning or problem solving abilities Behavioral and social problems Failure to grow intellectually or continued infant childlike behavior Problems keeping up in school Failure to adapt or adjust to new situations Difficulty understanding and following social rulesIn early childhood mild ID IQ 50 69 may not be obvious or identified until children begin school Even when poor academic performance is recognized it may take expert assessment to distinguish mild intellectual disability from specific learning disability or emotional behavioral disorders People with mild ID are capable of learning reading and mathematics skills to approximately the level of a typical child aged nine to twelve They can learn self care and practical skills such as cooking or using the local mass transit system As individuals with intellectual disability reach adulthood many learn to live independently and maintain gainful employment About 85 of persons with ID are likely to have mild ID Moderate ID IQ 35 49 is nearly always apparent within the first years of life Speech delays are particularly common signs of moderate ID People with moderate intellectual disabilities need considerable supports in school at home and in the community in order to fully participate While their academic potential is limited they can learn simple health and safety skills and to participate in simple activities As adults they may live with their parents in a supportive group home or even semi independently with significant supportive services to help them for example manage their finances As adults they may work in a sheltered workshop About 10 of persons with ID are likely to have moderate ID People with Severe ID IQ 20 34 accounting for 3 5 of persons with ID or Profound ID IQ 19 or below accounting for 1 5 of persons with ID need more intensive support and supervision for their entire lives They may learn some ADLs but an intellectual disability is considered severe or profound when individuals are unable to independently care for themselves without ongoing significant assistance from a caregiver throughout adulthood Individuals with profound ID are completely dependent on others for all ADLs and to maintain their physical health and safety They may be able to learn to participate in some of these activities to a limited degree
The presentation of acute appendicitis includes acute abdominal pain nausea vomiting and fever As the appendix becomes more swollen and inflamed it begins to irritate the adjoining abdominal wall This leads to the localization of the pain to the right lower quadrant This classic migration of pain may not be seen in children under three years This pain can be elicited through signs which can feel sharp Pain from appendicitis may begin as dull pain around the navel After several hours pain will usually transition towards the right lower quadrant where it becomes localized Symptoms include localized findings in the right iliac fossa The abdominal wall becomes very sensitive to gentle pressure palpation There is pain in the sudden release of deep tension in the lower abdomen Blumberg sign If the appendix is retrocecal localized behind the cecum even deep pressure in the right lower quadrant may fail to elicit tenderness silent appendix This is because the cecum distended with gas protects the inflamed appendix from pressure Similarly if the appendix lies entirely within the pelvis there is typically a complete absence of abdominal rigidity In such cases a digital rectal examination elicits tenderness in the rectovesical pouch Coughing causes point tenderness in this area McBurneys point historically called Dunphys sign
Clinically uterine sarcomas and leiomyomas fibroids both have similar symptoms such as increased uterine size abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding so it can be difficult to tell them apart Unusual or postmenopausal bleeding may be a sign of uterine sarcoma and needs to be investigated Other signs include pelvic pain pressure and unusual discharge A nonpregnant uterus that enlarges quickly is suspicious However none of the signs are specific Specific screening test have not been developed a Pap smear is a screening test for cervical cancer and not designed to detect uterine sarcoma
Children born with craniosynostosis have a distinct phenotype i e appearance observable traits caused by the expression of a conditions genes The features of craniosynostosis particular phenotype are determined by which suture is closed The fusion of this suture causes a certain change in the shape of the skull a deformity of the skull Virchows law dictates that when premature suture closure occurs growth of the skull typically is restricted perpendicularly to the fused suture and enhanced in a plane parallel to it thus trying to provide space for the fast growing brain Using this law the pattern of skull deformity in craniosynostosis often may be predicted

Despite the name the eye itself is not affected Blunt force or trauma to the eye socket results in burst capillaries and subsequent haemorrhaging hematoma The fatty tissue along with the lack of muscle around the eye socket allows a potential space for blood accumulation As this blood decomposes and is resorbed various pigments are released lending itself to the extreme outward appearance The appearance discoloration in purple and blue along with swelling does not usually indicate a serious injury and most black eyes resolve within a week The tissues around the eye are soft and thus bruise easily when compressed against margins of bone which surround and protect the eye socket The treatment is the same as that for bruises in other parts of the body cold compresses during the first twenty four hours During the process of healing and so long as there no breaks in the skin a black eye can be made less conspicuous by using cosmetics designed to obscure discolorations of the skin In a severe contusion blowout of the floor of the orbit may occur leading to double vision Such an injury may require surgical correction
Symptoms generally include heavy bleeding from the vagina that doesnt slow or stop over time Initially there may be an increased heart rate feeling faint upon standing and an increased respiratory rate As more blood is lost the patient may feel cold blood pressure may drop and they may become unconscious Signs and symptoms of circulatory shock may also include blurry vision cold and clammy skin confusion and feeling sleepy or weak
This condition is distinct and usually episodic with the people potentially experiencing remarkably high blood pressure intense headaches profuse sweating facial erythema goosebumps nasal stuffiness a feeling of doom or apprehension and blurred vision An elevation of 20 mm Hg over baseline systolic blood pressure with a potential source below the neurological level of injury meets the current definition of dysreflexia

Dilated cardiomyopathy develops insidiously and may not initially cause symptoms significant enough to impact on quality of life Nevertheless many people experience significant symptoms These might include Shortness of breath Syncope fainting Angina but only in the presence of ischemic heart diseaseA person who has dilated cardiomyopathy may have an enlarged heart with pulmonary edema and an elevated jugular venous pressure and a low pulse pressure Signs of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation may be present
Symptoms of pulmonary embolism are typically sudden in onset and may include one or many of the following dyspnea shortness of breath tachypnea rapid breathing chest pain of a pleuritic nature worsened by breathing cough and hemoptysis coughing up blood More severe cases can include signs such as cyanosis blue discoloration usually of the lips and fingers collapse and circulatory instability because of decreased blood flow through the lungs and into the left side of the heart About 15 of all cases of sudden death are attributable to PE While PE may present with syncope less than 1 of syncope cases are due to PE On physical examination the lungs are usually normal Occasionally a pleural friction rub may be audible over the affected area of the lung mostly in PE with infarct A pleural effusion is sometimes present that is exudative detectable by decreased percussion note audible breath sounds and vocal resonance Strain on the right ventricle may be detected as a left parasternal heave a loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound and or raised jugular venous pressure A low grade fever may be present particularly if there is associated pulmonary hemorrhage or infarction As smaller pulmonary emboli tend to lodge in more peripheral areas without collateral circulation they are more likely to cause lung infarction and small effusions both of which are painful but not hypoxia dyspnea or hemodynamic instability such as tachycardia Larger PEs which tend to lodge centrally typically cause dyspnea hypoxia low blood pressure fast heart rate and fainting but are often painless because there is no lung infarction due to collateral circulation The classic presentation for PE with pleuritic pain dyspnea and tachycardia is likely caused by a large fragmented embolism causing both large and small PEs Thus small PEs are often missed because they cause pleuritic pain alone without any other findings and large PEs are often missed because they are painless and mimic other conditions often causing ECG changes and small rises in troponin and brain natriuretic peptide levels PEs are sometimes described as massive submassive and nonmassive depending on the clinical signs and symptoms Although the exact definitions of these are unclear an accepted definition of massive PE is one in which there is hemodynamic instability This is a cause of obstructive shock which presents as sustained low blood pressure slowed heart rate or pulselessness
Mild cases of metabolic alkalosis often cause no symptoms Typical manifestations of moderate to severe metabolic alkalosis include abnormal sensations neuromuscular irritability tetany abnormal heart rhythms usually due to accompanying electrolyte abnormalities such as low levels of potassium in the blood coma seizures and temporary waxing and waning confusion
The classic history of esophageal rupture is one of severe retching and vomiting followed by excruciating retrosternal chest and upper abdominal pain Odynophagia tachypnea dyspnea cyanosis fever and shock develop rapidly thereafter Physical examination is usually not helpful particularly early in the course Subcutaneous emphysema crepitation is an important diagnostic finding but is not very sensitive being present in only 9 of 34 patients 27 percent in one series A pleural effusion may be detected Macklers triad includes chest pain vomiting and subcutaneous emphysema and while it is a classical presentation it is only present in 14 of people Pain can occasionally radiate to the left shoulder causing physicians to confuse an esophageal perforation with a myocardial infarction It may also be audibly recognized as Hammans sign
The thrombosis events associated with the COVID 19 vaccine may occur 4 28 days after its administration and mainly affects women under 55 Several relatively unusual types of thrombosis were specifically reported to be occurring in those with the reaction cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thrombosis of the splanchnic veins Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis may cause severe headache stroke like symptoms weakness of a limb and or facial muscles seizures and coma Splanchnic vein thrombosis may cause abdominal pain accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity and gastrointestinal bleeding Other forms of thrombosis such as the more common pulmonary embolism may also occur Arterial thrombosis has also been reported The low platelet count may manifest as petechia tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the site of the injection Disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC diffuse formation of blood clots throughout the blood vessels of the body has been reported as part of the syndrome DIC may cause a range of symptoms including abnormal bleeding breathlessness chest pain neurological symptoms low blood pressure or swelling COVID 19 vaccines have some adverse effects that are listed as common in the two or three days following vaccination which are usually mild and temporary
The signs and symptoms of hydronephrosis depend upon whether the obstruction is acute or chronic partial or complete unilateral or bilateral Hydronephrosis that occurs acutely with sudden onset as caused by a kidney stone can cause intense pain in the flank area between the hips and ribs known as a renal colic Historically this type of pain has been described as Dietls crisis Conversely hydronephrosis that develops gradually over time will generally cause either a dull discomfort or no pain Nausea and vomiting may also occur An obstruction that occurs at the urethra or bladder outlet can cause pain and pressure resulting from distension of the bladder Blocking the flow of urine will commonly be prone to urinary tract infections which can lead to further development of stones fever and blood or pus in the urine If complete obstruction occurs a postrenal kidney failure obstructive nephropathy may follow Blood tests may show impaired kidney function elevated urea or creatinine or electrolyte imbalances such as hyponatremia or hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis Urinalysis may indicate an elevated pH due to the secondary destruction of nephrons within the affected kidney which impairs acid excretion Physical examination in a thin patient may detect a palpable abdominal or flank mass caused by the enlarged kidney
Orthostatic hypotension is characterized by symptoms that occur after standing from lying or sitting particularly when done rapidly Many report lightheadedness a feeling that one might be about to faint sometimes severe or even actual fainting with associated fall risk With chronic orthostatic hypotension the condition and its effects may worsen even as fainting and many other symptoms become less frequent Generalized weakness or tiredness may also occur Some also report difficulty concentrating blurred vision tremulousness vertigo anxiety palpitations awareness of the heartbeat unsteadiness feeling sweaty or clammy and sometimes nausea A person may look pale Some people may experience severe orthostatic hypotension with the only symptoms being confusion or extreme fatigue Chronic severe orthostatic hypotension may present as fluctuating cognition delirium Women who are pregnant are also susceptible to orthostatic hypotension
Lactic acidosis is commonly found in people who are unwell such as those with severe heart and or lung disease a severe infection with sepsis the systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to another cause severe physical trauma or severe depletion of body fluids Symptoms in humans include all those of typical metabolic acidosis nausea vomiting generalized muscle weakness and laboured and deep breathing
Dysthymia characteristics include an extended period of depressed mood combined with at least two other symptoms which may include insomnia or hypersomnia fatigue or low energy eating changes more or less low self esteem or feelings of hopelessness Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions are treated as another possible symptom Irritability is one of the more common symptoms in children and adolescents Mild degrees of dysthymia may result in people withdrawing from stress and avoiding opportunities for failure In more severe cases of dysthymia people may withdraw from daily activities They will usually find little pleasure in usual activities and pastimes Diagnosis of dysthymia can be difficult because of the subtle nature of the symptoms and patients can often hide them in social situations making it challenging for others to detect symptoms Additionally dysthymia often occurs at the same time as other psychological disorders which adds a level of complexity in determining the presence of dysthymia particularly because there is often an overlap in the symptoms of disorders There is a high incidence of comorbid illness in those with dysthymia Suicidal behavior is also a particular problem with those with dysthymia It is vital to look for signs of major depression panic disorder generalised anxiety disorder alcohol and substance use disorders and personality disorder
The main symptom is vomiting which typically occurs after meals of undigested food devoid of any bile A history of previous peptic ulcers and loss of weight is not uncommon In advanced cases signs to look for on physical examination are wasting and dehydration Visible peristalsis from left to right may be present Succussion splash is a splash like sound heard over the stomach in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen on shaking the patient with or without the stethoscope Bowel sound may be increased borborygmi due to excessive peristaltic action of the stomach Fullness in the left hypochondrium may also be present
The primary characteristic of all forms of hypertrichosis is excessive hair Hair in hypertrichosis is usually longer than expected and may consist of any hair type lanugo vellus or terminal Patterned forms of hypertrichosis cause hair growth in patterns Generalized forms of hypertrichosis result in hair growth over the entire body Circumscribed and localized forms lead to hair growth restricted to a certain area
While not always present and often overlapping three progressive phases of intestinal ischemia have been described A hyper active stage occurs first in which the primary symptoms are severe abdominal pain and the passage of bloody stools Many patients get better and do not progress beyond this phase A paralytic phase can follow if ischemia continues in this phase the abdominal pain becomes more widespread the belly becomes more tender to the touch and bowel motility decreases resulting in abdominal bloating no further bloody stools and absent bowel sounds on exam Finally a shock phase can develop as fluids start to leak through the damaged colon lining This can result in shock and metabolic acidosis with dehydration low blood pressure rapid heart rate and confusion Patients who progress to this phase are often critically ill and require intensive care
Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop and symptoms may be slow to emerge Some early symptoms include tiredness weakness loss of appetite weight loss and nausea People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver As cirrhosis progresses symptoms can include neurological changes This can consist of cognitive impairments confusion memory loss sleep disorders and personality changes Worsening cirrhosis can cause a build up of fluid in different parts of the body such as the legs edema and abdomen ascites Other signs of advancing disease include itchy skin bruising easily dark urine and yellowing of the skin
Signs and symptoms of arterial occlusion depend on several factors including the location extent and onset of blockage Normally the blockage should affect approximately 70 of the artery for symptoms to become noticeable Symptoms can be less severe during gradual narrowing as this allows time for the widening of existing vessels and the formation of new ones collateral vessels allowing blood to still reach the area Symptoms in this case will simply be intermittent claudication Sudden narrowing leads to more severe consequences given the lack of time for collateral vessels to grow As such coldness numbness or even paralysis of the affected body parts may result The commonest symptom of arterial occlusion is intermittent claudication which consists of a painful aching sensation in the affected muscle This is often provoked with physical activity and relieved with rest Pain and muscle aching may build up with walking and accelerate with light jogging or walking uphill Often pain is relieved after several minutes of rest However affected individuals are limited to short spurts of activity impairing their quality of life For severe symptoms the signs are usually visible and lead to ischemia The clinical presentation of ischemia consists of the 6 Ps including pallor pain paresthesia paralysis pulselessness and poikilothermia Affected individuals initially notice a paleness of the affected region and feel severe pain As the condition worsens the region appears bluish and numb In extreme cases this will give way to paralysis and poikilothermia possibly requiring amputation of the affected limb
A woman may have vaginal irritation itching or burning or may notice a foul smelling or abnormal discharge that could appear green or yellow The following signs or symptoms may indicate the presence of infection Irritation or itching of the genital area inflammation irritation redness and swelling caused by the presence of extra immune cells of the labia majora labia minora or perineal area vaginal discharge foul vaginal odor pain irritation with sexual intercourse
Some or all of the following symptoms may be present though it is possible not to experience any symptoms Abdominal pain Dull aching pain within the abdomen or pelvis especially during intercourse Uterine bleeding Pain during or shortly after beginning or end of menstrual period irregular periods or abnormal uterine bleeding or spotting Fullness heaviness pressure swelling or bloating in the abdomen When a cyst ruptures from the ovary there may be sudden and sharp pain in the lower abdomen on one side Change in frequency or ease of urination such as inability to fully empty the bladder or difficulty with bowel movements due to pressure on adjacent pelvic anatomy Constitutional symptoms such as fatigue headaches Nausea or vomiting Weight gainOther symptoms may depend on the cause of the cysts Symptoms that may occur if the cause of the cysts is polycystic ovarian syndrome PCOS may include increased facial hair or body hair acne obesity and infertility If the cause is endometriosis then periods may be heavy and intercourse painful The effect of cysts not related to PCOS on fertility is unclear
Signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis are consistent with the following fatigue swollen abdomen difficulty breathing dyspnea swelling of legs and general weakness Related conditions are bacterial pericarditis pericarditis and pericarditis after a heart attack
There are no specific symptoms of CIN alone Generally signs and symptoms of cervical cancer include abnormal or post menopausal bleeding abnormal discharge changes in bladder or bowel function pelvic pain on examination abnormal appearance or palpation of cervix HPV infection of the vulva and vagina can cause genital warts or be asymptomatic
For many people cardiomegaly is asymptomatic For others if the enlarged heart begins to affect the bodys ability to pump blood effectively then symptoms associated with congestive heart failure may arise including Heart palpitations the irregular beating of the heart usually associated with a valve issue inside the heart Severe shortness of breath especially when physically active irregularly unable to catch ones breath Chest pain Coughing when lying down Fatigue Swelling in legs Increased abdominal girth Weight gain Edema swelling FaintingThere is not much variation in these symptoms because they are mostly specific to the chest area However some are more common than others depending on each patient
Related conditions Razor burn is a less serious condition caused by shaving characterized by mild to moderate redness and irritation on the surface of the skin Unlike PFB it is usually transient and there is no infection involved There is also a condition called folliculitis barbae The difference between the two is the cause of the inflammation in the hair follicles Where folliculitis barbae is caused by viral or bacterial infections pseudofolliculitis is created by irritation from shaving and ingrown hairs Pseudofolliculitis nuchae a related condition occurs on the back of the neck often along the posterior hairline when curved hairs are cut short and allowed to grow back into the skin Left untreated this can develop into acne keloidalis nuchae a condition in which hard dark keloid like bumps form on the neck Both occur frequently in black men in the military Here it is so common that services often have known protocols for management
TOS affects mainly the upper limbs with signs and symptoms manifesting in the shoulders neck arms and hands Pain can be present on an intermittent or permanent basis It can be sharp stabbing burning or aching TOS can involve only part of the hand as in the pinky and adjacent half of the ring finger all of the hand or the inner aspect of the forearm and upper arm Pain can also be in the side of the neck the pectoral area below the clavicle the armpit axillary area and the upper back i e the trapezius and rhomboid area Discoloration of the hands one hand colder than the other hand weakness of the hand and arm muscles and tingling are commonly present Only 1 of people with carpal tunnel syndrome have concomitant TOS Repetitive motions can cause enlargement of muscles which causes compression of veins Besides overuse injury of the upper limbs causes swellings small bleeding and subsequent fibrosis which would cause the thrombosis of the subclavian vein leading to Paget Schroetter disease or effort induced thrombosis TOS can be related to cerebrovascular arterial insufficiency when affecting the subclavian artery It also can affect the vertebral artery in which case it could produce vision disturbances including transient blindness and embolic cerebral infarction TOS can also lead to eye problems and vision loss as a circumstance of vertebral artery compression Although very rare if compression of the brain stem is also involved in an individual presentation of TOS transient blindness may occur while the head is held in certain positions If left untreated TOS can lead to neurological deficits as a result of the hypoperfusion and hypometabolism of certain areas of the brain and cerebellum TOS has similar symptoms to pectoralis minor syndrome PMS which usually results from compression of the braxial plexus beneath the pectoralis minor muscle while neurogenic TOS is caused by compression of the same nerves above the clavicle Unlike TOS there is typically few headaches or neck pain in patients with PMS only instead with pain in the chest area Initially it was believed that 95 percent of patients with TOS had nerve compression in the scalene area but in the twenty first century it is now recognized that the majority have nerve compression under the pectoralis minor either by itself or in addition to the scalene area One study of 100 patients diagnosed with neurogenic TOS found that 75 percent had neurogenic PMS and 30 percent in fact had PMS without TOS
Frontotemporal dementia FTD is an early onset disorder that mostly occurs before the age of 65 but can begin earlier and in 20 25 of cases onset is later It is the most common early presenting dementia The International Classification of Diseases recognizes the disease as causative to disorder affecting mental and behavioural aspects of the human organism Dissociation from family extreme oniomania vulgar speech characteristics screaming inability to control emotions behavior personality and temperament are characteristic social display patterns A gradual onset and progression of changes in behavior or language deficits are reported to have begun several years prior to presentation to a neurologist
WAS occurs most often in males due to its X linked recessive pattern of inheritance affecting between 1 and 10 males per million The first signs are usually petechiae and bruising resulting from a low platelet count i e thrombocytopenia Spontaneous nose bleeds and bloody diarrhea are also common and eczema typically develops within the first month of life Recurrent bacterial infections typically develop by three months of age The majority of children with WAS develop at least one autoimmune disorder and cancers mainly lymphoma and leukemia develop in up to a third of patients Immunoglobulin M IgM levels are reduced IgA and IgE are elevated and IgG levels can be normal reduced or elevated In addition to thrombocytopenia WAS patients have abnormally small platelets i e microthrombocytes and 30 also have elevated eosinophil counts i e eosinophilia
People with hypothyroidism often have no or only mild symptoms Numerous symptoms and signs are associated with hypothyroidism and can be related to the underlying cause or a direct effect of having not enough thyroid hormones Hashimotos thyroiditis may present with the mass effect of a goiter enlarged thyroid gland In middle aged women the symptoms may be mistaken for those of menopause
Areas that are usually affected include cheeks ears nose and fingers and toes Frostbite is often preceded by frostnip The symptoms of frostbite progress with prolonged exposure to cold Historically frostbite has been classified by degrees according to skin and sensation changes similar to burn classifications However the degrees do not correspond to the amount of long term damage A simplification of this system of classification is superficial first or second degree or deep injury third or fourth degree
Clinical features In adults the most common symptom of meningitis is a severe headache occurring in almost 90 of cases of bacterial meningitis followed by neck stiffness the inability to flex the neck forward passively due to increased neck muscle tone and stiffness The classic triad of diagnostic signs consists of neck stiffness sudden high fever and altered mental status however all three features are present in only 44 46 of bacterial meningitis cases If none of the three signs are present acute meningitis is extremely unlikely Other signs commonly associated with meningitis include photophobia intolerance to bright light and phonophobia intolerance to loud noises Small children often do not exhibit the aforementioned symptoms and may only be irritable and look unwell The fontanelle the soft spot on the top of a babys head can bulge in infants aged up to 6 months Other features that distinguish meningitis from less severe illnesses in young children are leg pain cold extremities and an abnormal skin color Nuchal rigidity occurs in 70 of bacterial meningitis in adults Other signs include the presence of positive Kernigs sign or Brudziński sign Kernigs sign is assessed with the person lying supine with the hip and knee flexed to 90 degrees In a person with a positive Kernigs sign pain limits passive extension of the knee A positive Brudzinskis sign occurs when flexion of the neck causes involuntary flexion of the knee and hip Although Kernigs sign and Brudzinskis sign are both commonly used to screen for meningitis the sensitivity of these tests is limited They do however have very good specificity for meningitis the signs rarely occur in other diseases Another test known as the jolt accentuation maneuver helps determine whether meningitis is present in those reporting fever and headache A person is asked to rapidly rotate the head horizontally if this does not make the headache worse meningitis is unlikely Other problems can produce symptoms similar to those above but from non meningitic causes This is called meningism or pseudomeningitis Meningitis caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis known as meningococcal meningitis can be differentiated from meningitis with other causes by a rapidly spreading petechial rash which may precede other symptoms The rash consists of numerous small irregular purple or red spots petechiae on the trunk lower extremities mucous membranes conjunctiva and occasionally the palms of the hands or soles of the feet The rash is typically non blanching the redness does not disappear when pressed with a finger or a glass tumbler Although this rash is not necessarily present in meningococcal meningitis it is relatively specific for the disease it does however occasionally occur in meningitis due to other bacteria Other clues on the cause of meningitis may be the skin signs of hand foot and mouth disease and genital herpes both of which are associated with various forms of viral meningitis
Epiglottitis is associated with fever throat pain difficulty in swallowing drooling hoarseness of voice and stridor Onset is typically over a day The throat itself may appear normal Stridor is a sign of upper airways obstruction and is a surgical emergency The child often appears acutely ill anxious and will have very quiet shallow breathing often keeping the head held forward and insisting on sitting up in bed The early symptoms are usually insidious but rapidly progressive and swelling of the throat may lead to cyanosis and asphyxiation
The symptoms of leptospirosis usually appear one to two weeks after infection but the incubation period can be as long as a month The illness is biphasic in a majority of symptomatic cases Symptoms of the first phase acute or leptospiremic phase last five to seven days In the second phase immune phase the symptoms resolve as antibodies against the bacteria are produced Additional symptoms develop in the second phase The phases of illness may not be distinct especially in patients with severe illness 90 of those infected experience mild symptoms while 10 experience severe leptospirosis Leptospiral infection in humans causes a range of symptoms though some infected persons may have none The disease begins suddenly with fever accompanied by chills intense headache severe muscle aches and abdominal pain A headache brought on by leptospirosis causes throbbing pain and is characteristically located at the heads bilateral temporal or frontal regions The person could also have pain behind the eyes and a sensitivity to light Muscle pain usually involves the calf muscle and the lower back The most characteristic feature of leptospirosis is the conjunctival suffusion conjunctivitis without exudate which is rarely found in other febrile illnesses Other characteristic findings on the eye include subconjunctival bleeding and jaundice A rash is rarely found in leptospirosis When one is found alternative diagnoses such as dengue fever and chikungunya fever should be considered Dry cough is observed in 20 57 of people with leptospirosis Thus this clinical feature can mislead a doctor to diagnose the disease as a respiratory illness Additionally gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea vomiting abdominal pain and diarrhoea frequently occur Vomiting and diarrhea may contribute to dehydration The abdominal pain can be due to acalculous cholecystitis or inflammation of the pancreas Rarely the lymph nodes liver and spleen may be enlarged and palpable There will be a resolution of symptoms for one to three days The immune phase starts after this and can last from four to 30 days and can be anything from brain to kidney complications The hallmark of the second phase is inflammation of the membranes covering the brain Signs and symptoms of meningitis include severe headache and neck stiffness Kidney involvement is associated with reduced or absent urine output The classic form of severe leptospirosis known as Weils disease is characterised by liver damage causing jaundice kidney failure and bleeding which happens in 5 10 of those infected Lung and brain damage can also occur For those with signs of inflammation of membranes covering the brain and the brain itself altered level of consciousness can happen A variety of neurological problems such as paralysis of half of the body complete inflammation of a whole horizontal section of spinal cord and muscle weakness due to immune damage of the nerves supplying the muscles are the complications Signs of bleeding such as non traumatic bruises at 1 mm 0 039 in non traumatic bruises more than 1 cm 0 39 in nose bleeding blackish stools due to bleeding in the stomach vomiting blood and bleeding from the lungs can also be found Prolongation of prothrombin time in coagulation testing is associated with severe bleeding manifestation However low platelet count is not associated with severe bleeding Pulmonary haemorrhage is alveolar haemorrhage bleeding into the alveoli of the lungs leading to massive coughing up of blood and causing acute respiratory distress syndrome where the risk of death is more than 50 Rarely inflammation of the heart muscles inflammation of membranes covering the heart abnormalities in the hearts natural pacemaker and abnormal heart rhythms may occur
The defining sign of kwashiorkor in a malnourished child is pitting edema particularly swelling of the hands and feet Unlike marasmus where the liver and other essential organs are reduced in size kwashiorkor is characterized by an enlarged fatty liver fibrosis and dysfunction of several organs such as the liver kidneys and nervous system Other signs include a distended abdomen thinning of hair loss of teeth skin or hair depigmentation and dermatitis Children with kwashiorkor often develop irritability and anorexia Generally the disease can be treated by adding protein to the diet however it can have a long term impact on a childs physical and mental development and in severe cases may lead to death In dry climates marasmus is the more frequent disease associated with malnutrition Another malnutrition syndrome includes cachexia although it is often caused by underlying illnesses These are important considerations in the treatment of individuals with kwashiorkor
Differentiating dementia syndromes can be challenging due to the frequently overlapping clinical features and related underlying pathology In particular Alzheimers disease often co occurs with vascular dementia People with vascular dementia present with progressive cognitive impairment acutely or sub acutely as in mild cognitive impairment frequently step wise after multiple cerebrovascular events strokes Some people may appear to improve between events and decline after further silent strokes A rapidly deteriorating condition may lead to death from a stroke heart disease or infection The disease is described as both a mental disorder and behavioural disorder within the International Classification of Diseases Signs and symptoms are cognitive motor behavioral and for a significant proportion of patients also affective These changes typically occur over a period of 5 10 years Signs are typically the same as in other dementias but mainly include cognitive decline and memory impairment of sufficient severity as to interfere with activities of daily living sometimes with presence of focal neurologic signs and evidence of features consistent with cerebrovascular disease on brain imaging CT or MRI The neurologic signs localizing to certain areas of the brain that can be observed are hemiparesis bradykinesia hyperreflexia extensor plantar reflexes ataxia pseudobulbar palsy as well as gait problems and swallowing difficulties People have patchy deficits in terms of cognitive testing They tend to have better free recall and fewer recall intrusions when compared with patients with Alzheimers disease In the more severely affected patients or patients affected by infarcts in Wernickes or Brocas areas specific problems with speaking called dysarthria and aphasias may be present In small vessel disease the frontal lobes are often affected Consequently patients with vascular dementia tend to perform worse than their Alzheimers disease counterparts in frontal lobe tasks such as verbal fluency and may present with frontal lobe problems apathy abulia lack of will or initiative problems with attention orientation and urinary incontinence They tend to exhibit more perseverative behavior VaD patients may also present with general slowing of processing ability difficulty shifting sets and impairment in abstract thinking Apathy early in the disease is more suggestive of vascular dementia Rare genetic disorders that cause vascular lesions in the brain have other presentation patterns As a rule they tend to occur earlier in life and have a more aggressive course In addition infectious disorders such as syphilis can cause arterial damage strokes and bacterial inflammation of the brain
The main symptoms are severe vertigo and nystagmus The most common symptom for vestibular neuritis is the onset of vertigo that has formed from an ongoing infection or trauma The dizziness sensation that is associated with vertigo is thought to be from the inner ear labyrinth Rapid and undesired eye motion nystagmus often results from the improper indication of rotational motion Nausea anxiety and a general ill feeling are common due to the distorted balance signals that the brain receives from the inner ear system Other common symptoms include tinnitus ear ache and a feeling of fullness in the ear
Cryptosporidiosis may occur as an asymptomatic infection an acute infection i e duration shorter than 2 weeks as recurrent acute infections in which symptoms reappear following a brief period of recovery for up to 30 days and as a chronic infection i e duration longer than 2 weeks in which symptoms are severe and persistent It may be fatal in individuals with a severely compromised immune system Symptoms usually appear 5 10 days after infection range 2 28 days and normally last for up to 2 weeks in immunocompetent individuals symptoms are usually more severe and persist longer in immunocompromised individuals Following the resolution of diarrhea symptoms can reoccur after several days or weeks due to reinfection The likelihood of re infection is high in immunocompromised adults and low in those with normal immune systems In immunocompetent individuals cryptosporidiosis is primarily localized to the distal small intestine and sometimes the respiratory tract as well In immunocompromised persons cryptosporidiosis may disseminate to other organs including the hepatobiliary system pancreas upper gastrointestinal tract and urinary bladder pancreatic and biliary infection can involve acalculous cholecystitis sclerosing cholangitis papillary stenosis or pancreatitis
People often have few or no symptoms They may get occasional muscular weakness muscle spasms tingling sensations or excessive urination High blood pressure manifestations of muscle cramps due to hyperexcitability of neurons secondary to low blood calcium muscle weakness due to hypoexcitability of skeletal muscles secondary to hypokalemia and headaches due to low blood potassium or high blood pressure may be seen Secondary hyperaldosteronism is often related to decreased cardiac output which is associated with elevated renin levels
Three main forms have been described thalassemia minor thalassemia intermedia and thalassemia major which vary from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe anemia requiring lifelong transfusions Individuals with beta thalassemia major those who are homozygous for thalassemia mutations or inheriting 2 mutations usually present within the first two years of life with symptomatic severe anemia poor growth and skeletal abnormalities Untreated thalassemia major eventually leads to death usually by heart failure therefore prenatal screening is very important Those with beta thalassemia intermedia those who are compound heterozygoutes for the beta thalassemia mutation usually present later in life with mild to moderate symptoms of anemia Beta thalassemia trait also known as beta thalassemia minor involves heterozygous inheritance of a beta thalassemia mutation and patients usually have borderline microcytic hypochromic anemia and they are usually asymptomatic or have mild symptoms Beta thalassemia minor can also present as beta thalassemia silent carriers those who inherit a beta thalassemic mutation but have no hematologic abnormalities nor symptoms Some people with thalassemia are susceptible to health complications that involve the spleen hypersplenism and gallstones due to hyperbilirubinemia from peripheral hemolysis These complications are mostly found in thalassemia major and intermedia patients Excess iron from hemolysis or transfusions causes serious complications within the liver heart and endocrine glands Severe symptoms include liver cirrhosis liver fibrosis and in extreme cases liver cancer Heart failure growth impairment diabetes and osteoporosis are life threatening conditions which can be caused by beta thalassemia major The main cardiac abnormalities seen as a result of beta thalassemia and iron overload include left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction pulmonary hypertension valvulopathy arrhythmias and pericarditis Increased gastrointestinal iron absorption is seen in all grades of beta thalassemia and increased red blood cell destruction by the spleen due to ineffective erythropoiesis further releases additional iron into the bloodstream Additional symptoms of beta thalassemia major or intermedia include the classic symptoms of moderate to severe anemia including fatigue growth and developmental delay in childhood leg ulcers and organ failure Ineffective erythropoiesis red blood cell production can also lead to compensatory bone marrow expansion which can then lead to bony changes deformities bone pain and craniofacial abnormalities Extramedullary organs such as the liver and spleen that can also undergo erythropoiesis become activated leading to hepatosplenomegaly enlargement of the liver and spleen Other tissues in the body can also become sites of erythropoiesis leading to extramedullary hematopoietic pseudotumors which may cause compressive symptoms if they occur in the thoracic cavity or spinal canal
Babies with this condition usually present any time in the first weeks to 6 months of life with progressively worsening vomiting It is more likely to affect the first born with males more commonly than females at a ratio of 4 to 1 The vomiting is often described as non bile stained non bilious and projectile vomiting because it is more forceful than the usual spitting up gastroesophageal reflux seen at this age Some infants present with poor feeding and weight loss but others demonstrate normal weight gain Dehydration may occur which causes a baby to cry without having tears and to produce less wet or dirty diapers due to not urinating for hours or for a few days Symptoms usually begin between 3 and 12 weeks of age Findings include epigastric fullness with visible peristalsis in the upper abdomen from the infants left to right Constant hunger belching and colic are other possible signs that the baby is unable to eat properly
In mild cases ET can manifest as the inability to stop the tongue or hands from shaking the ability to sing only in vibrato and difficulty doing small precise tasks such as threading a needle Even simple tasks such as cutting in a straight line or using a ruler can range from difficult to impossible depending on the severity of the condition In disabling cases ET can interfere with a persons activities of daily living including feeding dressing and taking care of personal hygiene Essential tremor generally presents as a rhythmic tremor 4 12 Hz that occurs only when the affected muscle is exerting effort Any sort of physical or mental stress tends to make the tremor worse The tremor may also occur in the head neck jaw and voice as well as other body regions with the general pattern being that the tremor begins in the arms and then spreads to these other regions in some people Women are more likely to develop the head tremor than are men Other types of tremor may also occur including postural tremor of the outstretched arms intention tremor of the arms and rest tremor in the arms Some people may have unsteadiness and problems with gait and balance ET related tremors do not occur during sleep but people with ET sometimes complain of an especially coarse tremor upon awakening that becomes noticeably less coarse within the first few minutes of wakefulness Tremor and disease activity intensity can worsen in response to fatigue strong emotions low blood sugar cold and heat caffeine lithium salts some antidepressants and other factors Typically the tremor worsens in performance situations such as when writing a cheque for payment at a store or giving a presentation Parkinsons disease and parkinsonism can also occur simultaneously with ET The degree of tremor rigidity and functional disability did not differ from patients with idiopathic Parkinsons disease Hand tremor predominated as it did in Parkinsons disease and occurred in nearly all cases followed by head tremor voice tremor neck face leg tongue and trunk tremor Most other tremors occurred in association with hand tremor More severe tremors a lower sleep disorder frequency and a similar prevalence of other non motor symptoms also can occur Walking difficulties in essential tremor are common About half of patients have associated dystonia including cervical dystonia writers cramp spasmodic dysphonia and cranial dystonia and 20 of the patients had associated parkinsonism Olfactory dysfunction loss of sense of smell is common in Parkinsons disease and has also been reported to occur in patients with essential tremor A number of patients with essential tremor also exhibit many of the same neuropsychiatric disturbances seen in idiopathic Parkinsons disease Essential tremor with tremor onset after the age of 65 has been associated with mild cognitive impairment as well as dementia although the link between these conditions if any is still not understood Essential tremor has two tremor components central and peripheral These two tremor components were identified by measuring the tremor of ET patients once with no weights on their hands and then with 1 lb weights on their hands The addition of the weights resulted in a tremor spectrum with two peaks one that maintained the same frequency the central tremor and one that decreased in frequency the peripheral tremor Only with the addition of the weights was the peripheral tremor distinguishable from the central tremor The frequency of essential tremor is 4 to 11 Hz depending on which body segment is affected Proximal segments are affected at lower frequencies and distal segments are affected at higher frequencies
The primary symptom of acute otitis media is ear pain other possible symptoms include fever reduced hearing during periods of illness tenderness on touch of the skin above the ear purulent discharge from the ears irritability ear blocking sensation and diarrhea in infants Since an episode of otitis media is usually precipitated by an upper respiratory tract infection URTI there are often accompanying symptoms like a cough and nasal discharge One might also experience a feeling of fullness in the ear Discharge from the ear can be caused by acute otitis media with perforation of the eardrum chronic suppurative otitis media tympanostomy tube otorrhea or acute otitis externa Trauma such as a basilar skull fracture can also lead to cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea discharge of CSF from the ear due to cerebral spinal drainage from the brain and its covering meninges
Hernias usually present as bulges in the groin area that can become more prominent when coughing straining or standing up The bulge commonly disappears on lying down Mild discomfort can develop over time The inability to reduce or place the bulge back into the abdomen usually means the hernia is incarcerated which requires emergency surgery As the hernia progresses contents of the abdominal cavity such as the intestines can descend into the hernia and run the risk of being pinched within the hernia causing an intestinal obstruction Significant pain at the hernia site is suggestive of a more severe course such as incarceration the hernia cannot be reduced back into the abdomen and subsequent ischemia and strangulation when the hernia becomes deprived of blood supply If the blood supply of the portion of the intestine caught in the hernia is compromised the hernia is deemed strangulated and gut ischemia and gangrene can result with potentially fatal consequences The timing of complications is not predictable
Acanthosis nigricans may present with thickened velvety relatively darker areas of skin on the neck armpit and in skin folds
Men with acute prostatitis often have chills fever pain in the lower back perineum or genital area urinary frequency and urgency often at night burning or painful urination body aches and a demonstrable infection of the urinary tract as evidenced by white blood cells and bacteria in the urine Acute prostatitis may be a complication of prostate biopsy Often the prostate gland is very tender to palpation through the rectum
These descriptions refer to classic Alport syndrome which usually causes significant disease from young adult or late childhood life Some individuals usually with milder mutations or carrier status develop disease later or show only some of the features of classic disease
Bronchiolitis typically presents in children under two years old and is characterized by a constellation of respiratory symptoms that consists of fever rhinorrhea cough wheeze tachypnea and increased work of breathing such as nasal flaring or grunting that develops over one to three days Crackles or wheeze are typical findings on listening to the chest with a stethoscope The child may also experience apnea or brief pauses in breathing After the acute illness it is common for the airways to remain sensitive for several weeks leading to recurrent cough and wheeze Some signs of severe disease include increased work of breathing such as use of accessory muscles of respiration rib sternal retraction tracheal tug severe chest wall recession Hoovers sign presence of nasal flaring and or grunting increased respiratory rate above normal hypoxia low oxygen levels cyanosis bluish skin lethargy and decreased activity poor feeding less than half of usual fluid intake in preceding 24 hours history of stopping breathing
The common carotid artery is the large artery whose pulse can be felt on both sides of the neck under the jaw On the right side it starts from the brachiocephalic artery a branch of the aorta and on the left side the artery comes directly off the aortic arch At the throat it forks into the internal carotid artery and the external carotid artery The internal carotid artery supplies the brain and the external carotid artery supplies the face This fork is a common site for atherosclerosis an inflammatory build up of atheromatous plaque inside the common carotid artery or the internal carotid arteries that causes them to narrow The plaque can be stable and asymptomatic or it can be a source of embolization Emboli break off from the plaque and travel through the circulation to blood vessels in the brain As the vessels get smaller an embolus can lodge in the vessel wall and restrict the blood flow to parts of the brain This ischemia can either be temporary yielding a transient ischemic attack TIA or permanent resulting in a thromboembolic stroke Transient ischemic attacks are a warning sign and may be followed by severe permanent strokes particularly within the first two days TIAs by definition last less than 24 hours and frequently take the form of weakness or loss of sensation of a limb or the trunk on one side of the body or the loss of sight amaurosis fugax in one eye Less common symptoms are artery sounds bruits or ringing in the ears tinnitus In asymptomatic individuals with a carotid stenosis the risk of developing a stroke is increased above those without a stenosis The risk of stroke is possibly related to the degree of stenosis on imaging Some studies have found an increased risk with increasing degrees of stenosis while other studies have not been able to find such a relationship
The signs and symptoms of infectious mononucleosis vary with age
The pain is continuous and may be described as extreme growing sharp shooting or throbbing Putting pressure or warmth on the tooth may induce extreme pain The area may be sensitive to touch and possibly swollen as well This swelling may be present at either the base of the tooth the gum and or the cheek and sometimes can be reduced by applying ice packs An acute abscess may be painless but still have a swelling present on the gum It is important to get anything that presents like this checked by a dental professional as it may become chronic later In some cases a tooth abscess may perforate bone and start draining into the surrounding tissues creating local facial swelling In some cases the lymph glands in the neck will become swollen and tender in response to the infection It may even feel like a migraine as the pain can transfer from the infected area The pain does not normally transfer across the face only upwards or downwards as the nerves that serve each side of the face are separate Severe aching and discomfort on the side of the face where the tooth is infected is also fairly common with the tooth itself becoming unbearable to touch due to extreme amounts of pain
Angular cheilitis is a fairly non specific term which describes the presence of an inflammatory lesion in a particular anatomic site i e the corner of the mouth As there are different possible causes and contributing factors from one person to the next the appearance of the lesion is somewhat variable The lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth but sometimes only one side may be affected In some cases the lesion may be confined to the mucosa of the lips and in other cases the lesion may extend past the vermilion border the edge where the lining on the lips becomes the skin on the face onto the facial skin Initially the corners of the mouth develop a gray white thickening and adjacent erythema redness Later the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema edema swelling and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth The mucosa of the lip may become fissured cracked crusted ulcerated or atrophied There is not usually any bleeding Where the skin is involved there may be radiating rhagades linear fissures from the corner of the mouth Infrequently the dermatitis which may resemble eczema can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin If Staphylococcus aureus is involved the lesion may show golden yellow crusts In chronic angular cheilitis there may be suppuration pus formation exfoliation scaling and formation of granulation tissue Sometimes contributing factors can be readily seen such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures which results in mandibular overclosure collapse of jaws If there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis swollen tongue may be present In people with angular cheilitis who wear dentures often there may be erythematous mucosa underneath the denture normally the upper denture an appearance consistent with denture related stomatitis Typically the lesions give symptoms of soreness pain pruritus itching or burning or a raw feeling
Retinoblastoma is universally known as the most intrusive intraocular cancer among children The chance of survival and preservation of the eye depends fully on the severity Retinoblastoma is extremely rare as there are only about 200 to 300 cases every year in the United States Looking at retinoblastoma globally only 1 in about 15 000 children have this malignancy but these numbers continuously increase Intraocular malignancies are more curable rather than extraocular malignancies due to early diagnosis and an early treatment prognosis During infant screenings if they incorporate an eye screening like they do a hearing screening it can be detected at an earlier age therefore preventing its spread Leucocoria is the primary indication of retinoblastoma and is when the cancer is still intraocular meaning inside the eye When light is reflected by the white tumor the view of the red retina is blocked Retinoblastoma can be curable after the initial sign and up to six months if the tumor is intraocular If you do not visit an ophthalmologist with signs of leucocoria within a reasonable amount of time the delay in the diagnosis could lead to a more severe prognosis Due to a delay in the diagnosis it could result in proptosis which is then considered extraocular the most severe The most common and obvious sign of retinoblastoma is an abnormal appearance of the retina as viewed through the pupil the medical term for which is leukocoria also known as amaurotic cats eye reflex Other signs and symptoms include deterioration of vision a red and irritated eye with glaucoma and faltering growth or delayed development Some children with retinoblastoma can develop a squint commonly referred to as cross eyed or wall eyed strabismus Retinoblastoma presents with advanced disease in developing countries and eye enlargement is a common finding Depending on the position of the tumors they may be visible during a simple eye exam using an ophthalmoscope to look through the pupil A positive diagnosis is usually made only with an examination under anesthetic EUA A white eye reflection is not always a positive indication of retinoblastoma and can be caused by light being reflected badly or by other conditions such as Coats disease The presence of the photographic fault red eye in only one eye and not in the other may be a sign of retinoblastoma A clearer sign is white eye or cats eye leukocoria
The symptoms of this condition include
Depending on the level of obstruction bowel obstruction can present with abdominal pain swollen abdomen abdominal distension and constipation Bowel obstruction may be complicated by dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities due to vomiting respiratory compromise from pressure on the diaphragm by a distended abdomen or aspiration of vomitus bowel ischemia or perforation from prolonged distension or pressure from a foreign body In small bowel obstruction the pain tends to be colicky cramping and intermittent in nature with spasms lasting a few minutes The pain tends to be central and mid abdominal Vomiting may occur before constipation In large bowel obstruction the pain is felt lower in the abdomen and the spasms last longer Constipation occurs earlier and vomiting may be less prominent Proximal obstruction of the large bowel may present as small bowel obstruction
Like other types of asthma it is characterized by airway inflammation reversible airways obstruction and bronchospasm but it is caused by something in the workplace environment Symptoms include shortness of breath tightness of the chest coughing sputum production and wheezing Some patients may also develop upper airway symptoms such as itchy eyes tearing sneezing nasal congestion and rhinorrhea Symptoms may develop over many years as in sensitizer induced asthma or may occur after a single exposure to a high concentration agent as in case of RADS
The signs and symptoms of asbestosis typically manifest after a significant amount of time has passed following asbestos exposure often several decades under current conditions in the US The primary symptom of asbestosis is generally the slow onset of shortness of breath especially with physical activity Clinically advanced cases of asbestosis may lead to respiratory failure When a stethoscope is used to listen to the lungs of a person with asbestosis they may hear inspiratory crackles The characteristic pulmonary function finding in asbestosis is a restrictive ventilatory defect This manifests as a reduction in lung volumes particularly the vital capacity VC and total lung capacity TLC The TLC may be reduced through alveolar wall thickening however this is not always the case Large airway function as reflected by FEV1 FVC is generally well preserved In severe cases the drastic reduction in lung function due to the stiffening of the lungs and reduced TLC may induce right sided heart failure cor pulmonale In addition to a restrictive defect asbestosis may produce reduction in diffusion capacity and a low amount of oxygen in the blood of the arteries
Symptoms of toxic multinodular goitre are similar to that of hyperthyroidism including heat intolerance muscle weakness wasting hyperactivity fatigue tremor irritability weight loss osteoporosis increased appetite non painful goitre swelling of the thyroid gland tachycardia high heart rate above 100 beats per minute at rest in adults tracheal compression exophthalmos
Pain in the perianal area is the most common symptom of an anorectal abscess The pain may be dull aching or throbbing It is worst when the person sits down and right before a bowel movement After the individual has a bowel movement the pain usually lessens Other signs and symptoms of anorectal abscess include constipation drainage from the rectum fever and chills or a palpable mass near the anus
Tetralogy of Fallot results in low oxygenation of blood This is due to a mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the left ventricle via the ventricular septal defect VSD and preferential flow of the mixed blood from both ventricles through the aorta because of the obstruction to flow through the pulmonary valve The latter is known as a right to left shunt Infants with TOF a cyanotic heart disease have low blood oxygen saturation Blood oxygenation varies greatly from one patient to another depending on the severity of the anatomic defects Typical ranges vary from 60 to around 90 Depending on the degree of obstruction symptoms vary from no cyanosis or mild cyanosis to profound cyanosis at birth If the baby is not cyanotic then it is sometimes referred to as a pink tet Other symptoms include a heart murmur which may range from almost imperceptible to very loud difficulty in feeding failure to gain weight retarded growth and physical development labored breathing dyspnea on exertion clubbing of the fingers and toes and polycythemia The baby may turn blue with breastfeeding or crying Those born with tetralogy of Fallot are more likely to experience psychiatric disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD in later life potentially due to underlying genetic changes that predispose to both conditions
Classically patients with chronic granulomatous disease will have recurrent bouts of infection due to the decreased capacity of their immune system to fight off disease causing organisms The recurrent infections they acquire are specific and are in decreasing order of frequency pneumonia abscesses of the skin tissues and organs septic arthritis osteomyelitis bacteremia fungemia superficial skin infections such as cellulitis or impetigoMost people with CGD are diagnosed in childhood usually before age 5 Early diagnosis is important since these people can be placed on antibiotics to ward off infections before they occur Small groups of CGD patients may also be affected by McLeod syndrome because of the proximity of the two genes on the same X chromosome
In infantile laryngomalacia the supraglottic larynx the part above the vocal cords is tightly curled with a short band holding the cartilage shield in the front the epiglottis tightly to the mobile cartilage in the back of the larynx the arytenoids These bands are known as the aryepiglottic folds The shortened aryepiglottic folds cause the epiglottis to be curled on itself This is the well known omega shaped epiglottis in laryngomalacia Another common finding of laryngomalacia involves the posterior or back part of the larynx where the arytenoid cartilages or the mucosa tissue over the arytenoid cartilages can collapse into the airway and cause airway obstruction Laryngomalacia results in partial airway obstruction most commonly causing a characteristic high pitched squeaking noise on inhalation inspiratory stridor Some infants have feeding difficulties related to this problem Rarely children will have significant life threatening airway obstruction The vast majority however will only have stridor without other more serious symptoms such as dyspnea difficulty breathing
Because common systems involved include the eye the urinary system and the hands and feet one clinical mnemonic in reactive arthritis is Cant see cant pee cant climb a tree The classic triad consists of Conjunctivitis Nongonococcal urethritis Asymmetric oligoarthritis Symptoms generally appear within 1 3 weeks but can range from 4 to 35 days from the onset of the inciting episode of the disease The classical presentation of the syndrome starts with urinary symptoms such as burning pain on urination dysuria or an increased frequency of urination Other urogenital problems may arise such as prostatitis in men and cervicitis salpingitis and or vulvovaginitis in women It presents with monoarthritis affecting the large joints such as the knees and sacroiliac spine causing pain and swelling An asymmetrical inflammatory arthritis of interphalangeal joints may be present but with relative sparing of small joints such as the wrist and hand Patient can have enthesitis presenting as heel pain Achilles tendinitis or plantar fasciitis along with balanitis circinata circinate balanitis which involves penile lesions present in roughly 20 to 40 percent of the men with the disease A small percentage of men and women develop small hard nodules called keratoderma blennorrhagicum on the soles of the feet and less commonly on the palms of the hands or elsewhere The presence of keratoderma blennorrhagica is diagnostic of reactive arthritis in the absence of the classical triad Subcutaneous nodules are also a feature of this disease Ocular involvement mild bilateral conjunctivitis occurs in about 50 of men with urogenital reactive arthritis syndrome and about 75 of men with enteric reactive arthritis syndrome Conjunctivitis and uveitis can include redness of the eyes eye pain and irritation or blurred vision Eye involvement typically occurs early in the course of reactive arthritis and symptoms may come and go Dactylitis or sausage digit a diffuse swelling of a solitary finger or toe is a distinctive feature of reactive arthritis and other peripheral spondylarthritides but can also be seen in polyarticular gout and sarcoidosis Mucocutaneous lesions can be present Common findings include oral ulcers that come and go In some cases these ulcers are painless and go unnoticed In the oral cavity the patients may experience recurrent aphthous stomatitis geographic tongue and migratory stomatitis in higher prevalence than the general population Some patients experience serious gastrointestinal problems similar to those of Crohns disease About 10 percent of people with reactive arthritis especially those with a prolonged course of the disease will develop cardiac manifestations including aortic regurgitation and pericarditis Reactive arthritis has been described as a precursor of other joint conditions including ankylosing spondylitis
The clinical signs of minimal change disease are proteinuria abnormal excretion of proteins mainly albumin into the urine edema swelling of soft tissues as a consequence of water retention weight gain and hypoalbuminaemia low serum albumin These signs are referred to collectively as nephrotic syndrome
Women with placenta previa often present with painless bright red vaginal bleeding This commonly occurs around 32 weeks of gestation but can be as early as late mid trimester More than half of women affected by placenta praevia 51 6 have bleeding before delivery This bleeding often starts mildly and may increase as the area of placental separation increases Placenta praevia should be suspected if there is bleeding after 24 weeks of gestation Bleeding after delivery occurs in about 22 of those affected Women may also present as a case of failure of engagement of fetal head
Almost all patients have clinically diagnosed asthma and present with wheezing usually episodic in nature coughing shortness of breath and exercise intolerance especially in patients with cystic fibrosis Moderate and severe cases have symptoms suggestive of bronchiectasis in particular thick sputum production often containing brown mucus plugs as well as symptoms mirroring recurrent infection such as pleuritic chest pain and fever Patients with asthma and symptoms of ongoing infection who do not respond to antibiotic treatment should be suspected of ABPA
Typically the first episode develops in the spring following the first exposure to intense sun Further episodes of the irritable rash occur several hours to days following subsequent sun exposure PLE appears on areas of the skin newly exposed to sunlight such as the visible part of the neckline backs of hands arms and legs and feet but less commonly the face At these areas there may be feelings of burning and severe itching Smooth red topped small papules which merge into plaques small fluid filled blisters papulovesicles and less commonly target shaped lesions which look like erythema multiforme may be visible In addition it may occur in other parts of the body in some people treated for inflammatory skin diseases with phototherapy The rash is usually quite symmetrical and characteristic for each individual appearing similar with each recurrence but can look dissimilar in different people Fever fatigue and headaches have been previously associated with the eruption but are rare The rash may persist for many days to a couple of weeks resolving spontaneously without scarring as long as further sunlight exposure is avoided Recurring yearly the eruption can sometimes last longer than a few days if persistent and repeated sun exposure occurs However the hardening effect with respite during the later summer frequently occurs with gradual exposure of sunlight eventually leading to significant improvement
Fever occurs in 97 of people malaise and endurance fatigue in 90 of people A new or changing heart murmur weight loss and coughing occurs in 35 of people Vascular phenomena septic embolism a piece of infected debris or tissue breaking off and traveling through the bloodstream to a distant site causing thromboembolic problems such as a stroke or gangrene of the fingers Janeway lesions painless hemorrhagic cutaneous lesions on the palms and soles bleeding in the brain conjunctival hemorrhage splinter hemorrhages kidney infarcts and splenic infarcts Infective endocarditis can also lead to the formation of mycotic aneurysms Immunologic phenomena glomerulonephritis which allows for blood and albumin to enter the urine Oslers nodes ephemeral spots of a painful nodular erythema chiefly in the skin of the hands and feet Roths spots on the retina positive serum rheumatoid factor Other signs may include night sweats rigors anemia spleen enlargement
The signs and symptoms of POI can be seen as part of a continuum of changes leading to menopause POI contrasts with age appropriate menopause in the age of onset degree of symptoms and sporadic return to normal ovarian function As some women retain partial ovarian function symptoms may not be as severe as regular menopause In others particularly with coexistent depression symptoms such as decreased quality of life can be severe Hormonally POI is defined by abnormally low levels of estrogen and high levels of FSH which demonstrate that the ovaries are no longer responding to circulating FSH by producing estrogen and developing fertile eggs The ovaries will likely appear smaller than normal The age of onset can be as early as 11 years POI can be seen as part of a continuum of changes leading to menopause that differ from age appropriate menopause in the age of onset degree of symptoms and sporadic return to normal ovarian function A contrasting problem can be when a girl never begins menstruation due to a genetic condition causing primary amenorrhea
In osteochondritis dissecans fragments of cartilage or bone become loose within a joint leading to pain and inflammation These fragments are sometimes referred to as joint mice OCD is a type of osteochondrosis in which a lesion has formed within the cartilage layer itself giving rise to secondary inflammation OCD most commonly affects the knee although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow People with OCD report activity related pain that develops gradually Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain swelling catching locking popping noises and buckling giving way the primary presenting symptom may be a restriction in the range of movement Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stage I however the onset of stage II occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis The disease progresses rapidly beyond stage II as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments Non specific symptoms caused by similar injuries such as sprains and strains can delay a definitive diagnosis Physical examination typically reveals fluid in the joint tenderness and crepitus The tenderness may initially spread but often reverts to a well defined focal point as the lesion progresses Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies acute osteochondral fracture has a similar presentation with tenderness in the affected joint but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis Although there is no significant pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur
Shortness of breath is the most common symptom followed by face or arm swelling Following are frequent symptoms
People with PLMD often have excessive daytime sleepiness EDS falling asleep during the day trouble falling asleep at night and difficulty staying asleep throughout the night Patients also display involuntary limb movements that occur at periodic intervals anywhere from 20 to 40 seconds apart They often only last the first half of the night during non REM sleep stages Movements do not occur during REM because of muscle atonia PLMS can be unilateral or bilateral and not really symmetrical or simultaneous PLMS is often a symptom of RLS but evidence for differences between those two sleep disorders was found in literature Sleep structure differed when RLS patients had significantly more REM sleep and less stage 1 sleep compared to PLMD patients Besides PLMI was significantly higher in patients with PLMD
Signs and symptoms of acute pyelonephritis generally develop rapidly over a few hours or a day It can cause high fever pain on passing urine and abdominal pain that radiates along the flank towards the back There is often associated vomiting Chronic pyelonephritis causes persistent flank or abdominal pain signs of infection fever unintentional weight loss malaise decreased appetite lower urinary tract symptoms and blood in the urine Chronic pyelonephritis can in addition cause fever of unknown origin Furthermore inflammation related proteins can accumulate in organs and cause the condition AA amyloidosis Physical examination may reveal fever and tenderness at the costovertebral angle on the affected side
Usually the atypical causes also involve atypical symptoms
The acute syndrome presents with rapidly progressive severe upper abdominal pain yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes liver enlargement enlargement of the spleen fluid accumulation within the peritoneal cavity elevated liver enzymes and eventually encephalopathy The fulminant syndrome presents early with encephalopathy and ascites Liver cell death and severe lactic acidosis may be present as well Caudate lobe enlargement is often present The majority of patients have a slower onset form of Budd Chiari syndrome This can be painless A system of venous collaterals may form around the occlusion which may be seen on imaging as a spiders web Patients may progress to cirrhosis and show the signs of liver failure On the other hand incidental finding of a silent asymptomatic form may not be a cause for concern
Symptoms of fungal meningitis are generally similar to those of other types of meningitis and include a fever stiff neck severe headache photophobia sensitivity to light nausea and vomiting and altered mental status drowsiness or confusion
The risks associated with this syndrome include a substantial risk of cancer especially of the breast and gastrointestinal tracts Colorectal is the most common malignancy with a lifetime risk of 39 percent followed by breast cancer in females with a lifetime risk of 32 to 54 percent Patients with the syndrome also have an increased risk of developing carcinomas of the liver lungs breast ovaries uterus testes and other organs Specifically it is associated with an increased risk of sex cord stromal tumor with annular tubules in the ovaries Due to the increased risk of malignancies direct surveillance is recommended The average age of first diagnosis is 23 The first presentation is often bowel obstruction or intussuseption from the hamartomatous gastrointestinal polyps Dark blue brown and black pigmented mucocutaneous macules are present in over 95 percent of individuals with Peutz Jeghers syndrome Pigmented lesions are rarely present at birth but often appear before 5 years of age The macules may fade during puberty The mealoncytic macules are not associated with malignant transformation Complications associated with Peutz Jeghers syndrome include obstruction and intussusception which occur in up to 69 percent of patients typically first between the ages of 6 and 18 though surveillance for them is controversial Anemia is also common due to gastrointestinal bleeding from the polyps
A hernia is present at the site of the umbilicus commonly called a navel or belly button in newborns although sometimes quite large these hernias tend to resolve without any treatment by around the age of 2 3 years Obstruction and strangulation of the hernia is rare because the underlying defect in the abdominal wall is larger than in an inguinal hernia of the newborn The size of the base of the herniated tissue is inversely correlated with risk of strangulation i e a narrow base is more likely to strangulate Babies are prone to this malformation because of the process during fetal development by which the abdominal organs form outside the abdominal cavity later returning into it through an opening which will become the umbilicus Hernias may be asymptomatic and present only as a bulge of the umbilicus Symptoms may develop when the contracting abdominal wall causes pressure on the hernia contents This results in abdominal pain or discomfort These symptoms may be worsened by the patient lifting or straining
Symptoms of PPD can occur any time in the first year postpartum Typically a diagnosis of postpartum depression is considered after signs and symptoms persist for at least two weeks
Other more common conditions e g otitis externa may also present with these symptoms but cholesteatoma is much more serious and should not be overlooked If a patient presents to a doctor with ear discharge and hearing loss the doctor should consider cholesteatoma until the disease is definitely excluded Other less common symptoms all less than 15 of cholesteatoma may include pain balance disruption tinnitus earache headaches and bleeding from the ear There can also be facial nerve weakness Balance symptoms in the presence of a cholesteatoma raise the possibility that the cholesteatoma is eroding the balance organs in the inner ear Doctors initial inspections may only reveal an ear canal full of discharge Until the doctor has cleaned the ear and inspected the entire tympanic membrane cholesteatoma cannot be diagnosed Once the debris is cleared cholesteatoma can give rise to a number of appearances If there is significant inflammation the tympanic membrane may be partially obscured by an aural polyp If there is less inflammation the cholesteatoma may present the appearance of semolina discharging from a defect in the tympanic membrane The posterior and superior parts of the tympanic membrane are most commonly affected If the cholesteatoma has been dry the cholesteatoma may present the appearance of wax over the attic The attic is just above the eardrum If untreated a cholesteatoma can eat into the three small bones located in the middle ear the malleus incus and stapes collectively called ossicles which can result in nerve deterioration deafness imbalance and vertigo It can also affect and erode through the enzymes it produces the thin bone structure that isolates the top of the ear from the brain as well as lay the covering of the brain open to infection with serious complications rarely even death due to brain abscess and sepsis Both the acquired as well as the congenital types of the disease can affect the facial nerve that extends from the brain to the face and passes through the inner and middle ear and leaves at the anterior tip of the mastoid bone and then rises to the front of the ear and extends into the upper and lower face
People burdened with LSC report pruritus followed by uncontrollable scratching of the same body region excessively Most common sites of LSC are the sides of the neck the scalp ankles vulva pubis scrotum and extensor sides of the forearms However due to the stigma associated with chronic scratching some patients will not admit to chronic rubbing or abrasion The skin may become thickened and hyperpigmented lichenified as a direct result of chronic excoriation Typically this period of increased scratching is associated with stressors
When plantar fasciitis occurs the pain is typically sharp and usually unilateral 70 of cases Bearing weight on the heel after long periods of rest worsens heel pain in affected individuals Individuals with plantar fasciitis often report their symptoms are most intense during their first steps after getting out of bed or after prolonged periods of sitting Symptoms typically improve with continued walking Rare but reported symptoms include numbness tingling swelling or radiating pain Typically there are no fevers or night sweats If the plantar fascia is overused in the setting of plantar fasciitis the plantar fascia can rupture Typical signs and symptoms of plantar fascia rupture include a clicking or snapping sound significant local swelling and acute pain in the bottom of the foot
The symptoms of organophosphate poisoning include muscle weakness fatigue muscle cramps fasciculation and paralysis Other symptoms include hypertension and hypoglycemia Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system due to accumulation of ACh results in anxiety headache convulsions ataxia depression of respiration and circulation tremor general weakness and potentially coma When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances tightness in chest wheezing due to bronchoconstriction increased bronchial secretions increased salivation lacrimation sweating peristalsis and urination can occur The effects of organophosphate poisoning on muscarinic receptors are recalled using the mnemonic SLUDGEM salivation lacrimation urination defecation gastrointestinal motility emesis miosis An additional mnemonic is MUDDLES miosis urination diarrhea diaphoresis lacrimation excitation and salivation The onset and severity of symptoms whether acute or chronic depends upon the specific chemical the route of exposure skin lungs or GI tract the dose and the individuals ability to degrade the compound which the PON1 enzyme level will affect
Signs and symptoms may include the following stiff neck limited neck mobility or torticollis some form of palpable neck pain may be in front of the neck or around the Adams Apple malaise difficulty swallowing fever stridor drooling croup like cough or enlarged cervical lymph nodes Any combination of these symptoms should arouse suspicion of RPA
The clinical features of cryoglobulinemic disease can reflect those due not only to the circulation of cryoglobulins but also to any underlying hematological premalignant or malignant disorder infectious disease or autoimmune syndrome The following sections of clinical features focuses on those attributed to the cryoglobulins Cryoglobulins cause tissue damage by three mechanisms they can
Lyme disease can affect several body systems and produce a broad range of symptoms Not everyone with Lyme disease has all of the symptoms and many of the symptoms are not specific to Lyme disease but can occur with other diseases as well The incubation period from infection to the onset of symptoms is usually one to two weeks but can be much shorter days or much longer months to years Lyme symptoms most often occur from May to September in the northern hemisphere because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases Asymptomatic infection exists but occurs in less than 7 of infected individuals in the United States Asymptomatic infection may be much more common among those infected in Europe
Most people with gallstones do not have symptoms However when a gallstone temporarily lodges in the cystic duct they experience biliary colic Biliary colic is abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastric region It is episodic occurring after eating greasy or fatty foods and leads to nausea and or vomiting People with cholecystitis most commonly have symptoms of biliary colic before developing cholecystitis The pain becomes severe and constant in cholecystitis Nausea is common and vomiting occurs in 75 of people with cholecystitis In addition to abdominal pain right shoulder pain can be present On physical examination an inflamed gallbladder is almost always tender to the touch and palpable 25 50 of cases in the midclavicular right lower rib margin Additionally a fever is common A gallbladder with cholecystitis is almost always tender to touch Because of the inflammation its size can be felt from the outside of the body in 25 50 of people with cholecystitis Pain with deep inspiration leading to termination of the breath while pressing on the right upper quadrant of the abdomen usually causes severe pain Murphys sign Yellowing of the skin jaundice may occur but is often mild Severe jaundice suggests another cause of symptoms such as choledocholithiasis People who are old have diabetes chronic illness or who are immunocompromised may have vague symptoms that may not include fever or localized tenderness
Signs and symptoms of psychogenic polydipsia include Excessive thirst and xerostomia leading to overconsumption of water Hyponatraemia causing headache muscular weakness twitching confusion vomiting irritability etc although this is only seen in 20 30 of cases Hypervolemia leading to oedema hypertension and weight gain due to the kidneys being unable to filter the excess blood in extreme episodes Tonic clonic seizure Behavioural changes including fluid seeking behaviour patients have been known to seek fluids from any available source such as toilets and shower rooms The most common presenting symptom is tonic clonic seizure found in 80 of patients Psychogenic polydipsia should be considered a life threatening condition since it has been known to cause severe hyponatraemia leading to cardiac arrest coma and cerebral oedema
Lower urinary tract infection is also referred to as a bladder infection The most common symptoms are burning with urination and having to urinate frequently or an urge to urinate in the absence of vaginal discharge and significant pain These symptoms may vary from mild to severe and in healthy women last an average of six days Some pain above the pubic bone or in the lower back may be present People experiencing an upper urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis may experience flank pain fever or nausea and vomiting in addition to the classic symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection Rarely the urine may appear bloody or contain visible pus in the urine UTIs have been associated with onset or worsening of delirium dementia and neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and psychosis The reasons for this are unknown but may involve a UTI mediated systemic inflammatory response which affects the brain Cytokines produced as part of the inflammatory response may produce neuroinflammation in turn affecting dopaminergic and or glutamatergic neurotransmission as well as brain glucose metabolism
Cerebral palsy is defined as a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture causing activity limitation that are attributed to non progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain While movement problems are the central feature of CP difficulties with thinking learning feeling communication and behavior often co occur with 28 having epilepsy 58 having difficulties with communication at least 42 having problems with their vision and 23 56 having learning disabilities Muscle contractions in people with cerebral palsy are commonly thought to arise from overactivation Cerebral palsy is characterized by abnormal muscle tone reflexes or motor development and coordination The neurological lesion is primary and permanent while orthopedic manifestations are secondary and progressive In cerebral palsy unequal growth between muscle tendon units and bone eventually leads to bone and joint deformities At first deformities are dynamic Over time deformities tend to become static and joint contractures develop Deformities in general and static deformities in specific joint contractures cause increasing gait difficulties in the form of tip toeing gait due to tightness of the Achilles tendon and scissoring gait due to tightness of the hip adductors These gait patterns are among the most common gait abnormalities in children with cerebral palsy However orthopaedic manifestations of cerebral palsy are diverse Additionally crouch gait excessive knee flexion gait is prevalent among children who possess the ability to walk The effects of cerebral palsy fall on a continuum of motor dysfunction which may range from slight clumsiness at the mild end of the spectrum to impairments so severe that they render coordinated movement virtually impossible at the other end of the spectrum Although most people with CP have problems with increased muscle tone some have normal or low muscle tone High muscle tone can either be due to spasticity or dystonia Babies born with severe cerebral palsy often have irregular posture their bodies may be either very floppy or very stiff Birth defects such as spinal curvature a small jawbone or a small head sometimes occur along with CP Symptoms may appear or change as a child gets older Babies born with cerebral palsy do not immediately present with symptoms Classically CP becomes evident when the baby reaches the developmental stage at 6 to 9 months and is starting to mobilise where preferential use of limbs asymmetry or gross motor developmental delay is seen Drooling is common among children with cerebral palsy which can have a variety of impacts including social rejection impaired speaking damage to clothing and books and mouth infections It can additionally cause choking An average of 55 5 of people with cerebral palsy experience lower urinary tract symptoms more commonly excessive storage issues than voiding issues Those with voiding issues and pelvic floor overactivity can deteriorate as adults and experience upper urinary tract dysfunction Children with CP may also have sensory processing issues Adults with cerebral palsy have a higher risk of respiratory failure
Pilonidal cysts are itchy and often very painful and typically occur between the ages of 15 and 35 Although usually found near the coccyx the condition can also affect the navel armpit the cheek or the genital region though these locations are much rarer Signs and symptoms may include Intermittent pain discomfort or swelling above the anus or near the tailbone Opaque yellow purulent or bloody discharge from the tailbone area Unexpected moisture in the tailbone region Discomfort sitting on the tailbone doing sit ups or riding a bicycle any activities that roll over the tailbone areaSome people with a pilonidal cyst will be asymptomatic
As open angle glaucoma is usually painless with no symptoms early in the disease process screening through regular eye exams is important The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss and optic nerve changes increased cup to disc ratio on fundoscopic examination About 10 of people with closed angles present with acute angle closure characterized by sudden ocular pain seeing halos around lights red eye very high intraocular pressure 30 mmHg 4 0 kPa nausea and vomiting suddenly decreased vision and a fixed mid dilated pupil It is also associated with an oval pupil in some cases Acute angle closure is an emergency Opaque specks may occur in the lens in glaucoma known as glaukomflecken
Signs and symptoms are mainly due to secondary increased intracranial pressure due to blockage of the fourth ventricle and tumors are usually present for 1 to 5 months before diagnosis is made The child typically becomes listless with repeated episodes of vomiting and a morning headache which may lead to a misdiagnosis of gastrointestinal disease or migraine Soon after the child will develop a stumbling gait truncal ataxia frequent falls diplopia papilledema and sixth cranial nerve palsy Positional vertigo and nystagmus are also frequent and facial sensory loss or motor weakness may be present Decerebrate attacks appear late in the disease Extraneural metastasis to the rest of the body is rare and when it occurs it is in the setting of relapse more commonly in the era prior to routine chemotherapy
NPH exhibits a classic triad of clinical findings known as the Adams triad or Hakims triad The triad consists of walking difficulty reduced attention span and urinary frequency or incontinence The triad is considered obsolete for diagnosis purposes and newer guidelines are available Gait deviations are present in nearly all patients and usually the first symptom This is caused by expansion of the lateral ventricles to impinge on the corticospinal tract motor fibers The typical gait abnormality in NPH is a broad based slow short stepped stuck to the floor or magnetic movement The gait abnormalities in NPH may bear resemblance to a gait associated with Parkinsons disease The gait deviation can be classified as mild marked or severe marked is when the patient has difficulty walking because of considerable instability severe is when it is not possible for the patient to walk without aids such as a cane or a wheeled walker Dementia presents as progressive cognitive impairment which is present in 60 of patients at time of treatment This is caused by distortions predominantly at the frontal lobe and the subcortex Initial deficits involve planning organization attention and concentration Further deficits include difficulty managing finances taking medications driving keeping track of appointments daytime sleeping short term memory impairments and psychomotor slowing Late stage features include apathy reduced drive slowed thinking and reduced speech Urinary incontinence appears late in the illness and is present in 50 of patients at time of treatment Urinary dysfunction begins as increased frequency often at night and progresses to urge incontinence and permanent incontinence
The vast majority of aneurysms are asymptomatic However as the abdominal aorta expands and or ruptures the aneurysm may become painful and lead to pulsating sensations in the abdomen or pain in the chest lower back legs or scrotum
The symptoms due to a prolactinoma are broadly divided into those that are caused by increased prolactin levels or mass effect Those that are caused by increased prolactin levels are Amenorrhea disappearance of ovulation periods Galactorrhea Milk production infrequent in men Loss of axillary and pubic hair Hypogonadism Reduced function of the gonads Gynecomastia an increase in male breast size Erectile dysfunction in males Those that are caused by mass effect are
Symptoms
Hiatal hernia has often been called the great mimic because its symptoms can resemble many disorders Among them a person with a hiatal hernia can experience dull pains in the chest shortness of breath caused by the hernias effect on the diaphragm heart palpitations due to irritation of the vagus nerve and swallowed food balling up and causing discomfort in the lower esophagus until it passes on to the stomach In addition hiatal hernias often result in heartburn but may also cause chest pain or pain with eating In most cases however a hiatal hernia does not cause any symptoms The pain and discomfort that a patient experiences is due to the reflux of gastric acid air or bile While there are several causes of acid reflux it occurs more frequently in the presence of hiatal hernia In newborns the presence of Bochdalek hernia can be recognised from symptoms such as difficulty breathing fast respiration increased heart rate
Most cases are asymptomatic or are discovered during an investigation of blood in the urine Symptomatic patients typically present as middle aged adults with renal colic kidney stones nephrocalcinosis and or recurrent urinary tract infections however MSK also may affect children very rarely In addition to the typical clinical phenotype of recurrent stone disease other clinical profiles have now been recognized that is an indolent almost asymptomatic MSK and a rare form characterized by intractable pain
The first signs of HELLP usually start appearing midway through the third trimester though the signs can appear in earlier and later stages Symptoms vary in severity and between individuals and are commonly mistaken with normal pregnancy symptoms especially if they are not severe HELLP syndrome patients experience general discomfort followed by severe epigastric pain or right upper abdominal quadrant pain accompanied by nausea vomiting backache anaemia and hypertension Some patients may also have a headache and visual issues These symptoms may also become more severe at night As the condition progresses and worsens a spontaneous hematoma occurs following the rupture of the liver capsule which occurs more frequently in the right lobe The presence of any combinations of these symptoms subcapsular liver hematoma in particular warrants an immediate check up due to the high morbidity and mortality rates of this condition
According to the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders the attacks must meet the following criteria
This group of disorders affects connective tissues across the body with symptoms most typically present in the joints skin and blood vessels However as connective tissue is found throughout the body EDS may result in an array of unexpected impacts with any degree of severity and the condition is not limited to joints skin and blood vessels Effects may range from mildly loose joints to life threatening cardiovascular complications Due to the diversity of subtypes within the EDS family symptoms may vary widely between individuals diagnosed with EDS
Viral meningitis characteristically presents with fever headache and neck stiffness Fever is the result of cytokines released that affect the thermoregulatory temperature control neurons of the hypothalamus Cytokines and increased intracranial pressure stimulate nociceptors in the brain that lead to headaches Neck stiffness is the result of inflamed meninges stretching due to flexion of the spine The various layers of meninges act form a separation between the brain and the skull In contrast to bacterial meningitis symptoms associated with viral meningitis are often less severe and do not progress as quickly Nausea vomiting and photophobia light sensitivity also commonly occur as do general signs of a viral infection such as muscle aches and malaise Increased cranial pressure from viral meningitis stimulates the area postrema which causes nausea and vomiting Widened pulse pressure systolic diastolic blood pressure bradycardia and irregular respiration would be alarming for Cushings reflex a sign of acutely elevated intracranial pressure Photophobia is due to meningeal irritation In severe cases people may experience concomitant encephalitis meningoencephalitis which is suggested by symptoms such as altered mental status seizures or focal neurologic deficits Babies with viral meningitis may only appear irritable sleepy or have trouble eating Infection in the neonatal period may be the result of infection during pregnancy In severe cases people may experience concomitant encephalitis meningoencephalitis which is suggested by symptoms such as altered mental status seizures or focal neurologic deficits The pediatric population may show some additional signs and symptoms that include jaundice and bulging fontanelles A biphasic fever is more often seen in children compared to adults The first fever arrives with the onset of general constitutional symptoms and the second accompanying the onset of the neurological symptoms Symptoms can vary depending on the virus responsible for infection Enteroviral meningitis the most common cause typically presents with the classic headache photophobia fever nausea vomiting and nuchal rigidity With coxsackie and echo virus specifically a maculopapular rash may be present or even the typical vesicles seen with Herpangina Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus LCMV can be differentiated from the common presenting meningeal symptoms by the appearance of a prodromal influenza like sickness about 10 days before other symptoms begin Mumps meningitis can present similarly to isolated mumps with possible parotid and testicular swelling Interestingly research has shown that HSV 2 meningitis most often occurs in people with no history of genital herpes and that a severe frontal headache is among the most common presenting symptoms Patients with varicella zoster meningitis may present with herpes zoster Shingles in conjunction with classic meningeal signs Meningitis can be an indication that an individual with HIV is undergoing seroconversion the time when the human body is forming antibodies in response to the virus
Craniopharyngiomas are almost always benign However as with many brain tumors their treatment can be difficult and significant morbidities are associated with both the tumor and treatment
The most frequently observed problems related to an AVM are headaches and seizures cranial nerve deficits backaches neckaches and eventual nausea as the coagulated blood makes its way down to be dissolved in the individuals spinal fluid It is supposed that 15 of the population at detection have no symptoms at all Other common symptoms are a pulsing noise in the head progressive weakness and numbness and vision changes as well as debilitating excruciating pain In serious cases the blood vessels rupture and there is bleeding within the brain intracranial hemorrhage Nevertheless in more than half of patients with AVM hemorrhage is the first symptom Symptoms due to bleeding include loss of consciousness sudden and severe headache nausea vomiting incontinence and blurred vision amongst others Impairments caused by local brain tissue damage on the bleed site are also possible including seizure one sided weakness hemiparesis a loss of touch sensation on one side of the body and deficits in language processing aphasia Ruptured AVMs are responsible for considerable mortality and morbidity AVMs in certain critical locations may stop the circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid causing accumulation of the fluid within the skull and giving rise to a clinical condition called hydrocephalus A stiff neck can occur as the result of increased pressure within the skull and irritation of the meninges
Varicocele might be noticed as soft lumps usually above the testicle and mostly on the left side of the scrotum Right sided and bilateral varicocele does also occur Men with varicocele can feel symptoms of pain or heaviness in their scrotum Large varicoceles present as plexus of veins and may be described as bag of worms Varicocele is sometimes discovered when investigating the cause of male infertility
Although astigmatism may be asymptomatic higher degrees of astigmatism may cause symptoms such as blurred vision double vision squinting eye strain fatigue or headaches Some research has pointed to the link between astigmatism and higher prevalence of migraine headaches
A reaction typically begins within 24 hours of exposure and peaks at 48 72 hours after exposure Initially the skin turns red and starts to itch and burn Large blisters or bullae form within 48 hours The blisters may leave black brown or purplish scars that can last for several years This hyperpigmentation of the skin is caused by the production of melanin triggered by the furanocoumarins Although media reports have suggested that eye exposure to the agent can lead to temporary or permanent blindness the risk of permanent blindness is not supported by existing research Phytophotodermatitis can affect people of any age In children it has sometimes been mistaken for child abuse
The first sign of a stye is a small yellowish spot at the center of the bump that develops as pus and expands in the area Other stye symptoms may include
Infants are often born in a collodion membrane a shiny wax outer layer on the skin and usually with ectropion a condition in which the eyelids turn outwards When the membrane is shed the skin is red with a generalized white scale Palms soles and areas on the joints are often affected with hyperkeratosis a thickening of the layer of dead skin cells on the surface of the skin forming scales Eclabium eversion of the lips ectropion and alopecia hair loss are more common in CIE than in lamellar ichthyosis LI CIE can present very similarly to LI and they often share characteristics though the two conditions can often be differentiated by the appearance of the scales Scales on patients with CIE are fine and white on skin with erythema while appear larger and greyer on the limbs compared to LI where scales appear large and dark
The symptoms of a chylothorax depend its size and the underlying cause A small chylothorax may not cause any symptoms and only be detected on a chest X ray performed for another reason A large chylothorax may lead to breathlessness or a feeling of pressure in the chest caused by fluid restricting the expansion of the lungs although large chylothoraces may remain asymptomatic if the chylothorax has accumulated slowly as the lungs may have had time to become used to the pressure Fever or chest pain are not usually associated with chylothorax as chyle does not generate inflammation by itself On examination chylothorax may lead to reduced breath sounds on the affected side associated with a dull sound when the chest is tapped or percussed In cases of postoperative chylothorax the first sign may be persistent drainage from intercostal drains Large chylothoraces may cause signs related to the loss of nutrients including features of malnutrition or decreased ability to fight infections Rapidly accumulating chylothoraces can cause a sudden drop in blood volume leading to low blood pressure
The signs and symptoms of uveitis include the following
Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception thoughts mood and behavior Symptoms are described in terms of positive negative and cognitive symptoms The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms These may be present in any of the different psychoses and are often transient making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first episode psychosis FEP
The presentation of amyloidosis is broad and depends on the site of amyloid accumulation The kidney and heart are the most common organs involved
The 10th version of the International Classification of Diseases ICD 10 classifies social anxiety as a mental and behavioral disorder
A common symptom of laryngeal papillomatosis is a change in voice quality More specifically hoarseness is observed As a consequence of the narrowing of the laryngeal or tracheal parts of the airway shortness of breath chronic cough and stridor i e noisy breathing which can sound like a whistle or a snore can be present As the disease progresses occurrence of secondary symptoms such as dysphagia pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome failure to thrive and recurrent upper respiratory infections can be diagnosed The risk of laryngeal papillomatosis spreading to the lungs is higher in the juvenile onset than the adult onset In children symptoms are usually more severe and often mistaken for manifestations of other diseases such as asthma croup or bronchitis Therefore diagnosis is usually delayed
Primary infection Primary infection most commonly manifests as blepharoconjunctivitis i e infection of lids and conjunctiva that heals without scarring Lid vesicles and conjunctivitis are seen in primary infection Corneal involvement is rarely seen in primary infection
Individuals with congenital hypfibringenemia often lack any symptoms are detected by routine lab testing of fibrinogen or when tested for it because close relatives have symptomatic hypofibrinogenemia Indeed studies indicate that among family members with the identical congenital hypofibrinogenemia mutation some never exhibit symptoms and those that are symptomatic develop symptoms only as adults
In some cases EGJOO may cause no symptoms and the manometry findings are identified during an evaluation prior to anti reflux surgery In other cases EGJOO may be identified after an evaluation for esophageal symptoms The most common symptoms are dysphagia 50 75 typical reflux 29 67 atypical reflux 21 36 chest pain 16 46 abdominal pain 43 or regurgitation 38 One study suggested about 5 of individuals have no symptoms
Symptoms in asymptomatic infantile onset 12 months after birth and later onset Krabbe disease present themselves differently Of individuals with infantile onset Krabbe disease 85 90 display progressive neurologic deterioration in infancy and death before the age of two Symptoms include irritability fevers limb stiffness seizures feeding difficulties like GERD vomiting staring episodes and slowing of mental and motor development In the first stages of the disease doctors often mistake the symptoms for those of cerebral palsy Other symptoms include muscle weakness spasticity deafness optic atrophy optic nerve enlargement blindness paralysis and difficulty when swallowing Prolonged weight loss may also occur 10 15 of individuals with later onset Krabbe disease have a much slower disease progression These individuals may also display symptoms such as esotropia slurred speech and slow development or loss of motor milestones
Kawasaki disease often begins with a high and persistent fever that is not very responsive to normal treatment with paracetamol acetaminophen or ibuprofen This is the most prominent symptom of Kawasaki disease and is a characteristic sign that the disease is in its acute phase the fever normally presents as a high above 39 40 C and remittent and is followed by extreme irritability Recently it is reported to be present in patients with atypical or incomplete Kawasaki disease nevertheless it is not present in 100 of cases The first day of fever is considered the first day of the illness and its duration is typically one to two weeks in the absence of treatment it may extend for three to four weeks Prolonged fever is associated with a higher incidence of cardiac involvement It responds partially to antipyretic drugs and does not cease with the introduction of antibiotics However when appropriate therapy is started intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin the fever subsides after two days Bilateral conjunctival inflammation has been reported to be the most common symptom after fever It typically involves the bulbar conjunctivae is not accompanied by suppuration and is not painful This usually begins shortly after the onset of fever during the acute stage of the disease Anterior uveitis may be present under slit lamp examination Iritis can occur too Keratic precipitates are another eye manifestation detectable by a slit lamp but are usually too small to be seen by the unaided eye Kawasaki disease also presents with a set of mouth symptoms the most characteristic of which are a red tongue swollen lips with vertical cracking and bleeding The mucosa of the mouth and throat may be bright red and the tongue may have a typical strawberry tongue appearance marked redness with prominent gustative papillae These mouth symptoms are caused by necrotizing microvasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis Cervical lymphadenopathy is seen in 50 to 75 of children whereas the other features are estimated to occur in 90 but sometimes it can be the dominant presenting symptom According to the diagnostic criteria at least one impaired lymph node 15 mm in diameter should be involved Affected lymph nodes are painless or minimally painful nonfluctuant and nonsuppurative erythema of the neighboring skin may occur Children with fever and neck adenitis who do not respond to antibiotics should have Kawasaki disease considered as part of the differential diagnoses
Signs and symptoms of neutropenia include fever painful swallowing gingival pain skin abscesses and otitis These symptoms may exist because individuals with neutropenia often have infection Children may show signs of irritability and poor feeding Additionally hypotension has also been observed in individuals who have this condition
Signs and symptoms may include
CPEO is a rare disease that may affect those of all ages but typically manifests in the young adult years CPEO is the most common manifestation of mitochondrial myopathy occurring in an estimated two thirds of all cases of mitochondrial myopathy Patients typically present with ptosis drooping eyelids Other diseases like Graves disease myasthenia gravis and glioma that may cause an external ophthalmoplegia must be ruled out
Substernal or left precordial pleuritic chest pain with radiation to the trapezius ridge the bottom portion of scapula on the back is the characteristic pain of pericarditis The pain is usually relieved by sitting up or bending forward and worsened by lying down both recumbent and supine positions or by inspiration taking a breath in The pain may resemble that of angina but differs in that pericarditis pain changes with body position where heart attack pain is generally constant and pressure like Other symptoms of pericarditis may include dry cough fever fatigue and anxiety Due to its similarity to the pain of myocardial infarction heart attack pericarditis can be misdiagnosed as a heart attack Acute myocardial infarction can also cause pericarditis but the presenting symptoms often differ enough to warrant diagnosis The following table organizes the clinical presentation of pericarditis differential to myocardial infarction
People usually complain of pain in one joint which persists for months or even years does not ease with exercise steroid injection or heat treatment shows nothing on X ray but shows a definite restriction of movement There are 3 defined stages to this disease
Each of the five classical lacunar syndromes has a relatively distinct symptom complex Symptoms may occur suddenly progressively or in a fluctuating e g the capsular warning syndrome manner Occasionally cortical infarcts and intracranial hemorrhages can mimic lacunar infarcts but true cortical signs aphasia visuospatial neglect gaze deviation and visual field defects are always absent in lacunar strokes The classic syndromes are as follows
Prodrome TEN ultimately results in extensive skin involvement with redness necrosis and detachment of the top epidermal layer of the skin and mucosa Before these severe findings develop people often have a flu like prodrome with a cough runny nose fever decreased appetite and malaise A history of drug exposure exists on average 14 days ranging from 1 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms but may result as early as 48 hours if it is a reexposure
People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough fever accompanied by shaking chills shortness of breath sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths and an increased rate of breathing In elderly people confusion may be the most prominent sign The typical signs and symptoms in children under five are fever cough and fast or difficult breathing Fever is not very specific as it occurs in many other common illnesses and may be absent in those with severe disease malnutrition or in the elderly In addition a cough is frequently absent in children less than 2 months old More severe signs and symptoms in children may include blue tinged skin unwillingness to drink convulsions ongoing vomiting extremes of temperature or a decreased level of consciousness Bacterial and viral cases of pneumonia usually result in similar symptoms Some causes are associated with classic but non specific clinical characteristics Pneumonia caused by Legionella may occur with abdominal pain diarrhea or confusion Pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with rusty colored sputum Pneumonia caused by Klebsiella may have bloody sputum often described as currant jelly Bloody sputum known as hemoptysis may also occur with tuberculosis Gram negative pneumonia lung abscesses and more commonly acute bronchitis Pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae may occur in association with swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck joint pain or a middle ear infection Viral pneumonia presents more commonly with wheezing than bacterial pneumonia Pneumonia was historically divided into typical and atypical based on the belief that the presentation predicted the underlying cause However evidence has not supported this distinction therefore it is no longer emphasized
Most cases of leukoplakia cause no symptoms but infrequently there may be discomfort or pain The exact appearance of the lesion is variable Leukoplakia may be white whitish yellow or grey The size can range from a small area to much larger lesions The most common sites affected are the buccal mucosa the labial mucosa and the alveolar mucosa although any mucosal surface in the mouth may be involved The clinical appearance including the surface texture and color may be homogeneous or non homogeneous see classification Some signs are generally associated with a higher risk of cancerous changes see prognosis Leukoplakia may rarely be associated with esophageal carcinoma 805
A headache is called thunderclap headache if it is severe in character and reaches maximum severity within seconds to minutes of onset In many cases there are no other abnormalities but the various causes of thunderclap headaches may lead to a number of neurological symptoms
The lesion at the base of the keratin mound is benign in the majority of cases Malignancy is present in up to 20 of cases with squamous cell carcinoma being the most common type The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma increases to 37 when the cutaneous horn is present on the penis Tenderness at the base of the lesion often suggests the presence of a possible underlying squamous cell carcinoma
Symptoms of the familial form include visual impairment caused by diffuse corneal opacities target cell hemolytic anemia and kidney failure Less common symptoms include atherosclerosis hepatomegaly enlarged liver splenomegaly enlarged spleen and enlarged lymph nodes Fish eye disease is less severe and most commonly presents with impaired vision due to corneal opacification It rarely presents with other findings although atherosclerosis hepatomegaly splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy can occur Carlson and Philipson found that the disease was named so because the cornea of the eye was so opaque or cloudy with dots of cholesterol that it resembled a boiled fish If an individual only carries one copy of the mutated gene they typically do not show symptoms
Micropsia causes affected individuals to perceive objects as being smaller or more distant than they actually are The majority of individuals with micropsia are aware that their perceptions do not mimic reality Many can imagine the actual sizes of objects and distances between objects It is common for patients with micropsia to be able to indicate true size and distance despite their inability to perceive objects as they actually are One specific patient was able to indicate the dimensions of specific objects with her hands She was also able to estimate the distances between two objects and between an object and herself She succeeded in indicating horizontal vertical and 45 degree positions and did not find it difficult to search for an object in a cluttered drawer indicating that her figure ground discrimination was intact despite having micropsia Individuals experiencing hemimicropsia often complain that objects in their left or right visual field appear to be shrunken or compressed They may also have difficulty appreciating the symmetry of pictures When drawing patients often have a tendency to compensate for their perceptual asymmetry by drawing the left or right half of objects slightly larger than the other In a case of one person with hemimicropsia asked to draw six symmetrical objects the size of the picture on the left half was on average 16 larger than the corresponding right half
Up to 7 difference in image size is well tolerated If magnification difference becomes excessive the effect can cause diplopia suppression disorientation eyestrain headache and dizziness and balance disorders Asthenopic symptoms alone may occur even if image size difference is less than 7
Medulloepithelioma have been reported to occur in the cerebral hemispheres brainstem cerebellum and peripheral sites Due to rapid growth of the tumour patients typically present with increased intracranial pressure seizures and focal neurologic signs
It is a characterized by a breakdown or damage of the epithelium of the cornea in a pinpoint pattern which can be seen with examination with a slit lamp Patients may present with non specific symptoms such as red eye tearing foreign body sensation photophobia and burning
The initial retinal degenerative symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa are characterized by decreased night vision nyctalopia and the loss of the mid peripheral visual field The rod photoreceptor cells which are responsible for low light vision and are orientated mainly in the retinal periphery are the retinal processes affected first during non syndromic without other conditions forms of this disease Visual decline progresses relatively quickly to the far peripheral field eventually extending into the central visual field as tunnel vision increases Visual acuity and color vision can become compromised due to accompanying loss of the cone photoreceptor cells which are responsible for color vision visual acuity and sight in the central visual field The progression of disease occurs in both eyes in a similar but not identical pattern A variety of indirect symptoms characterize retinitis pigmentosa along with the direct effects of the initial rod photoreceptor degeneration and later cone photoreceptor decline Phenomena such as photophobia which describes the event in which light is perceived as an intense glare and photopsia the presence of blinking swirling or shimmering lights spontaneously occurring within the visual field often manifest during the later stages of RP Findings related to RP have often been characterized in the fundus back layer of the eye as the ophthalmic triad This includes the development of 1 a mottled appearance of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium RPE that gives the same visual appearance of Bone Spicule patterns but are not Bone Spicules 2 a waxy yellow appearance of the optic disk and 3 the attenuation of blood vessels in size and Arterial Venous ratio as they enter and exit the Optic Disk of the retina and transverse it Non syndromic RP RP appears alone without other co morbidities usually presents a variety of the following symptoms Night blindness Tunnel vision due to loss of peripheral vision Latticework vision due to patchy loss of peripheral vision
Acute metabolic acidosis Symptoms are not specific and diagnosis can be difficult unless patients present with clear indications for arterial blood gas sampling Symptoms may include palpitations headache altered mental status such as severe anxiety due to hypoxia decreased visual acuity nausea vomiting abdominal pain altered appetite and weight gain muscle weakness bone pain and joint pain People with acute metabolic acidosis may exhibit deep rapid breathing called Kussmaul respirations which is classically associated with diabetic ketoacidosis Rapid deep breaths increase the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled thus lowering the serum carbon dioxide levels resulting in some degree of compensation Overcompensation via respiratory alkalosis to form an alkalemia does not occur Extreme acidemia can also lead to neurological and cardiac complications
Complications A rare but severe complication of this disease is vertebrobasilar insufficiency This is a result of the vertebral artery becoming occluded as it passes up in the transverse foramen The spinal joints become stiff in cervical spondylosis Thus the chondrocytes which maintain the disc become deprived of nutrition and die Secondary osteophytes may cause stenosis for spinal nerves manifesting as radiculopathy
According to an April 2010 U S Department of Veterans Affairs VA sponsored study conducted by the Institute of Medicine IOM part of the U S National Academy of Sciences 250 000 of the 696 842 U S servicemen and women in the 1991 Gulf War continue to be affected by chronic multi symptom illness which the IOM now refers to as Gulf War illness The IOM found that it continued to affect these veterans nearly 20 years after the war According to the IOM It is clear that a significant portion of the soldiers deployed to the Gulf War have experienced troubling constellations of symptoms that are difficult to categorize said committee chair Stephen L Hauser professor and chair department of neurology University of California San Francisco UCSF Unfortunately symptoms that cannot be easily quantified are sometimes incorrectly dismissed as insignificant and receive inadequate attention and funding by the medical and scientific establishment Veterans who continue to suffer from these symptoms deserve the very best that modern science and medicine can offer to speed the development of effective treatments cures and we hope prevention Our report suggests a path forward to accomplish this goal and we believe that through a concerted national effort and rigorous scientific input answers can be found Questions still exist regarding why certain veterans showed and still show medically unexplained symptoms while others did not why symptoms are diverse in some and specific in others and why combat exposure is not consistently linked to having or not having symptoms The lack of data on veterans pre deployment and immediate post deployment health status and lack of measurement and monitoring of the various substances to which veterans may have been exposed make it difficult and in many cases impossible to reconstruct what happened to service members during their deployments nearly 20 years after the fact the committee noted The report called for a substantial commitment to improving identification and treatment of multisymptom illness in Gulf War veterans focussing on continued monitoring of Gulf War veterans improved medical care examination of genetic differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups and studies of environment gene interactions A variety of signs and symptoms have been associated with GWI
The onset of HLH occurs before the age of one year in approximately 70 percent of cases Familial HLH should be suspected if siblings are diagnosed with HLH or if symptoms recur when therapy has been stopped Familial HLH is an autosomal recessive disease hence each sibling of a child with familial HLH has a twenty five percent chance of developing the disease a fifty percent chance of carrying the defective gene which is very rarely associated with any risk of disease and a twenty five percent chance of not being affected and not carrying the gene defect Patients with HLH especially when untreated may need intensive therapy Therefore HLH should be included in the differential diagnosis of intensive care unit patients with cytopenia and hyperferritinemia Patients in the earlier stages of HLH are frequently hospitalized at internal medicine wards HLH clinically manifests with fever enlargement of the liver and spleen enlarged lymph nodes yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes and a rash Laboratory findings may include elevated triglyceride levels low fibrinogen levels transaminitis and elevated ferritin levels among others
Signs and symptoms of this disorder include low levels of ketones hypoketosis and low blood sugar hypoglycemia Together these signs are called hypoketotic hypoglycemia People with this disorder typically also have an enlarged liver hepatomegaly muscle weakness and elevated levels of carnitine in the blood
Gallstones regardless of size or number are often asymptomatic These silent stones do not require treatment and can remain asymptomatic even years after they form A characteristic symptom of a gallstone attack is the presence of colic like pain in the upper right side of the abdomen often accompanied by nausea and vomiting Pain from symptomatic gallstones may range from mild to severe and can steadily increase over a period lasting from 30 minutes to several hours Other symptoms may include fever as well as referred pain between the shoulder blades or below the right shoulder If one or more gallstones block the bile ducts and cause bilirubin to leak into the bloodstream and surrounding tissue jaundice and itching may also occur In this case liver enzyme levels are likely to be raised Often gallbladder attacks occur after eating a heavy meal Attacks are most common in the evening or at night
Acute adenoiditis is characterized by fever runny nose nasal airway obstruction resulting in predominantly oral breathing snoring and sleep apnea Rhinorrhea with serous secretion in viral forms and mucous purulent secretion in bacterial forms In cases due to viral infection symptoms usually recede spontaneously after 48 hours symptoms of bacterial adenoiditis typically persist up to a week Adenoiditis is sometimes accompanied by tonsillitis Repeated adenoiditis may lead to enlarged adenoids
KP results in small rough bumps on the surface of the skin They are skin colored bumps the size of a grain of sand many of which are surrounded by a slight pink color in light skinned people and dark spots in dark skinned people Most people with KP do not have symptoms but the bumps in the skin can occasionally be itchy Irritation due to scratching KP bumps can result in redness and inflammation Though people with KP experience the condition year round the problem can become exacerbated with the bumps likely to look and feel more pronounced in color and texture during the colder months when moisture levels in the air are lower The symptoms may also worsen during pregnancy or after childbirth Increased sun exposure might mitigate the symptoms of KP
A supplemental system of phenotypic grading that uses seven classes instead of the traditional three was proposed by pediatric endocrinologist Charmian A Quigley et al in 1995 The first six grades of the scale grades 1 through 6 are differentiated by the degree of genital masculinization grade 1 is indicated when the external genitalia is fully masculinized grade 6 is indicated when the external genitalia is fully feminized and grades 2 through 5 quantify four degrees of increasingly feminized genitalia that lie in the interim Grade 7 is indistinguishable from grade 6 until puberty and is thereafter differentiated by the presence of secondary terminal hair grade 6 is indicated when secondary terminal hair is present whereas grade 7 is indicated when it is absent The Quigley scale can be used in conjunction with the traditional three classes of AIS to provide additional information regarding the degree of genital masculinization and is particularly useful when the diagnosis is PAIS
The classic symptom of subarachnoid hemorrhage is thunderclap headache a headache described as like being kicked in the head or the worst ever developing over seconds to minutes This headache often pulsates towards the occiput the back of the head About one third of people have no symptoms apart from the characteristic headache and about one in ten people who seek medical care with this symptom are later diagnosed with a subarachnoid hemorrhage Vomiting may be present and 1 in 14 have seizures Confusion decreased level of consciousness or coma may be present as may neck stiffness and other signs of meningism Neck stiffness usually presents six hours after initial onset of SAH Isolated dilation of a pupil and loss of the pupillary light reflex may reflect brain herniation as a result of rising intracranial pressure pressure inside the skull Intraocular hemorrhage bleeding into the eyeball may occur in response to the raised pressure subhyaloid hemorrhage bleeding under the hyaloid membrane which envelops the vitreous body of the eye and vitreous hemorrhage may be visible on fundoscopy This is known as Terson syndrome occurring in 3 13 percent of cases and is more common in more severe SAH Oculomotor nerve abnormalities affected eye looking downward and outward and inability to lift the eyelid on the same side or palsy loss of movement may indicate bleeding from the posterior communicating artery Seizures are more common if the hemorrhage is from an aneurysm it is otherwise difficult to predict the site and origin of the hemorrhage from the symptoms SAH in a person known to have seizures is often diagnostic of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation The combination of intracerebral hemorrhage and raised intracranial pressure if present leads to a sympathetic surge i e over activation of the sympathetic system This is thought to occur through two mechanisms a direct effect on the medulla that leads to activation of the descending sympathetic nervous system and a local release of inflammatory mediators that circulate to the peripheral circulation where they activate the sympathetic system As a consequence of the sympathetic surge there is a sudden increase in blood pressure mediated by increased contractility of the ventricle and increased vasoconstriction leading to increased systemic vascular resistance The consequences of this sympathetic surge can be sudden severe and are frequently life threatening The high plasma concentrations of adrenaline also may cause cardiac arrhythmias irregularities in the heart rate and rhythm electrocardiographic changes in 27 percent of cases and cardiac arrest in 3 percent of cases may occur rapidly after the onset of hemorrhage A further consequence of this process is neurogenic pulmonary edema where a process of increased pressure within the pulmonary circulation causes leaking of fluid from the pulmonary capillaries into the air spaces the alveoli of the lung Subarachnoid hemorrhage may also occur in people who have had a head injury Symptoms may include headache decreased level of consciousness and hemiparesis weakness of one side of the body SAH is a frequent occurrence in traumatic brain injury and carries a poor prognosis if it is associated with deterioration in the level of consciousness While thunderclap headache is the characteristic symptom of subarachnoid hemorrhage less than 10 of those with concerning symptoms have SAH on investigations A number of other causes may need to be considered
The index and middle fingers are most commonly affected and may present with redness swelling and pain Pus or discharge may be present
Symptoms of sideroblastic anemia include skin paleness fatigue dizziness and enlarged spleen and liver Heart disease liver damage and kidney failure can result from iron buildup in these organs

During early menopause transition the menstrual cycles remain regular but the interval between cycles begins to lengthen Hormone levels begin to fluctuate Ovulation may not occur with each cycle The term menopause refers to a point in time that follows one year after the last menstruation During the menopausal transition and after menopause women can experience a wide range of symptoms However for women who enter the menopause transition without having regular menstrual cycles due to prior surgery other medical conditions or ongoing hormonal contraception the menopause cannot be identified by bleeding patterns and is defined as the permanent loss of ovarian function
Symptoms of a prior nuchal cord shortly after birth in the baby may include duskiness of face facial petechia and bleeding in the whites of the eye Complications can include meconium respiratory disease anemia and still birth
The initial trauma causing the infection is often forgotten or not noticed The infection builds at the site over a period of years and a small red papule skin elevation appears The lesion is usually not painful with few if any symptoms Patients rarely seek medical care at this point Several complications may occur Usually the infection slowly spreads to the surrounding tissue while still remaining localized to the area around the original wound However sometimes the fungi may spread through the blood vessels or lymph vessels producing metastatic lesions at distant sites Another possibility is secondary infection with bacteria This may lead to lymph stasis obstruction of the lymph vessels and elephantiasis The nodules may become ulcerated or multiple nodules may grow and coalesce affecting a large area of a limb
Antenatal depression is classified based on a womans symptoms During pregnancy a lot of changes to mood memory eating habits and sleep are common When these common traits become severe and begin to alter ones day to day life that is when it is considered to be antenatal depression Symptoms of antenatal depression are
The size of oral mucoceles vary from 1 mm to several centimeters and they usually are slightly transparent with a blue tinge On palpation mucoceles may appear fluctuant but can also be firm Their duration lasts from days to years and may have recurrent swelling with occasional rupturing of its contents
AMS is generally characterized by abnormal appearances of the skin eyes fingers genitals head and face Infants with AMS will have thin redundantly wrinkled skin and excessive facial creases wide set eyes with absent or severely underdeveloped eyelids and down turned lower eyelids and a wide fish like mouth that may be fused together at the corners Other appearances of the face and head include broad nasal bridge wide flared nostrils and thick and flared alae nasi edges of the nostrils Abnormalities can also be seen in the hands and fingers as infants with AMS will also have webbed fingers with limited ability to flex and extend the fingers Infants with AMS will also display small rudimentary ears that are atypically low set on the skull Absence of the zygomatic bone is also possible Skin may be dry and coarse excessively wrinkled around the face and loose around the hands yet tight around the finger joints leading to diminished use of the fingers Genital defects may include ambiguous genitalia a displaced and or atypically small penis micropenis an absent scrotum around the testes and undescended testicles Finally alopecia and thin sparse hair are also frequently observed

Rhinoliths present as a unilateral nasal obstruction Foul smelling blood stained discharge is often present Nosebleed and pain may occur due to the ulceration of surrounding mucosa
Central nervous system Central nervous system oxygen toxicity manifests as symptoms such as visual changes especially tunnel vision ringing in the ears tinnitus nausea twitching especially of the face behavioural changes irritability anxiety confusion and dizziness This may be followed by a tonic clonic seizure consisting of two phases intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds tonic phase followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking clonic phase The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness the postictal state The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration However exposure time before onset is unpredictable as tests have shown a wide variation both amongst individuals and in the same individual from day to day In addition many external factors such as underwater immersion exposure to cold and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide Other factors such as darkness and caffeine increase tolerance in test animals but these effects have not been proven in humans
Yaws is classified as primary secondary and tertiary this is useful but people often have a mix of stages Within 9 90 days but usually about 21 days of infection a painless but distinctive mother yaw nodule appears Initially reddened and inflamed it may become a papilloma which can then become an ulcer possibly with a yellow crust Mother yaws are most commonly found on the legs and ankles and are rarely found on the genitals unlike syphilis The mother yaw enlarges and becomes warty in appearance Nearby daughter yaws may also appear simultaneously This primary stage resolves completely with scarring within 3 6 months The scar is often pigmented
Symptoms vary according to the kind of dystonia involved In most cases dystonia tends to lead to abnormal posturing in particular on movement Many individuals with the condition have continuous pain cramping and relentless muscle spasms due to involuntary muscle movements Other motor symptoms are possible including lip smacking Early symptoms may include loss of precision muscle coordination sometimes first manifested in declining penmanship frequent small injuries to the hands and dropped items cramping pain with sustained use and trembling Significant muscle pain and cramping may result from very minor exertions like holding a book and turning pages It may become difficult to find a comfortable position for arms and legs with even the minor exertions associated with holding arms crossed causing significant pain similar to restless leg syndrome Affected persons may notice trembling in the diaphragm while breathing or the need to place hands in pockets under legs while sitting or under pillows while sleeping to keep them still and to reduce pain Trembling in the jaw may be felt and heard while lying down and the constant movement to avoid pain may result in the grinding and wearing down of teeth or symptoms similar to temporomandibular joint disorder The voice may crack frequently or become harsh triggering frequent throat clearing Swallowing can become difficult and accompanied by painful cramping Electrical sensors EMG inserted into affected muscle groups while painful can provide a definitive diagnosis by showing pulsating nerve signals being transmitted to the muscles even when they are at rest The brain appears to signal portions of fibers within the affected muscle groups at a firing speed of about 10 Hz causing them to pulsate tremble and contort When called upon to perform an intentional activity the muscles fatigue very quickly and some portions of the muscle groups do not respond causing weakness while other portions over respond or become rigid causing micro tears under load The symptoms worsen significantly with use especially in the case of focal dystonia and a mirror effect is often observed in other body parts Use of the right hand may cause pain and cramping in that hand as well as in the other hand and legs that were not being used Stress anxiety lack of sleep sustained use and cold temperatures can worsen symptoms Direct symptoms may be accompanied by secondary effects of the continuous muscle and brain activity including disturbed sleep patterns exhaustion mood swings mental stress difficulty concentrating blurred vision digestive problems and short temper People with dystonia may also become depressed and find great difficulty adapting their activities and livelihood to a progressing disability Side effects from treatment and medications can also present challenges in normal activities In some cases symptoms may progress and then plateau for years or stop progressing entirely The progression may be delayed by treatment or adaptive lifestyle changes while forced continued use may make symptoms progress more rapidly In others the symptoms may progress to total disability making some of the more risky forms of treatment worth considering In some cases with patients who already have dystonia a subsequent traumatic injury or the effects of general anesthesia during an unrelated surgery can cause the symptoms to progress rapidly An accurate diagnosis may be difficult because of the way the disorder manifests itself Affected individuals may be diagnosed as having similar and perhaps related disorders including Parkinsons disease essential tremor carpal tunnel syndrome temporomandibular joint disorder Tourettes syndrome conversion disorder or other neuromuscular movement disorders It has been found that the prevalence of dystonia is high in individuals with Huntingtons disease where the most common clinical presentations are internal shoulder rotation sustained fist clenching knee flexion and foot inversion Risk factors for increased dystonia in patients with Huntingtons disease include long disease duration and use of antidopaminergic medication
Acute Most people exposed to B pseudomallei experience no symptoms The mean incubation period of acute melioidosis is 9 days range 1 21 days Nevertheless symptoms of melioidosis can appear in 24 hours for those who experienced near drowning in water Those affected present with symptoms of sepsis predominantly fever with or without pneumonia or localised abscess or other focus of infection The presence of non specific signs and symptoms has caused melioidosis to be nicknamed the great mimicker Diabetes mellitus is one of the most important risk factors in developing melioidosis The disease should be considered in anyone who has spent time in endemic areas who develops a fever pneumonia or abscesses in their liver spleen prostate or parotid gland The clinical manifestation of the disease can range from simple skin changes such as abscesses or ulcerations to severe organ problems The commonest organs affected are liver spleen lungs prostate and kidneys Among the most common features are bacteremia in 40 to 60 of cases pneumonia 50 and septic shock 20 People with only pneumonia may have a prominent cough with sputum and shortness of breath However those with septic shock together with pneumonia may have minimal coughing Results of a chest X ray can range from diffuse nodular infiltrates in those with septic shock to progressive consolidation located most commonly in the upper lobes for those with pneumonia only Pleural effusion and empyema are more common for melioidosis affecting lower lobes of the lungs In 10 of cases people develop secondary pneumonia caused by other bacteria after the primary infection In northern Australia 60 of the infected children presented with only skin lesions while 20 presented with pneumonia Depending on the course of infection other severe manifestations develop Approximately 1 to 5 of those infected develop inflammation of the brain and brain covering or brain abscess 14 to 28 develop pyelonephritis kidney abscess or prostatic abscesses 0 to 30 develop neck or salivary gland abscesses 10 to 33 develop liver spleen or paraintestinal abscesses and 4 to 14 develop septic arthritis and osteomyelitis Rare manifestations include lymph node disease resembling tuberculosis mediastinal masses pericardial effusion mycotic aneurysm and inflammation of the pancreas In Australia up to 20 of infected males develop prostatic abscess which may manifests clinically as pain during urination difficulty in passing urine and urinary retention requiring catheterisation Rectal examination may find enlarged prostate In Thailand 30 of the infected children develop parotid abscesses Encephalomyelitis not only happens in those with risk factors but can also occur in healthy people without risk factors Those with melioidosis encephomyelitis tend to have normal computed tomography CT scans but increased T2 signal by magnetic resonance imaging MRI extending to the brain stem and spinal cord Clinical signs include unilateral upper motor neuron limb weakness cerebellar signs and cranial nerve palsies VI VII nerve palsies and bulbar palsy Some cases presented with flaccid paralysis alone In northern Australia all melioidosis with encephalomyelitis cases had elevated white cells in the cerebrospinal fluid CSF mostly mononuclear cells with elevated CSF protein
Avoidant individuals are preoccupied with their own shortcomings and form relationships with others only if they believe they will not be rejected They often view themselves with contempt while showing a decreased ability to identify traits within themselves that are generally considered as positive within their societies Loss and social rejection are so painful that these individuals will choose to be alone rather than risk trying to connect with others Some with this disorder fantasize about idealized accepting and affectionate relationships because of their desire to belong They often feel themselves unworthy of the relationships they desire and shame themselves from ever attempting to begin them If they do manage to form relationships it is also common for them to pre emptively abandon them out of fear of the relationship failing Individuals with the disorder tend to describe themselves as uneasy anxious lonely unwanted and isolated from others They often choose jobs of isolation in which they do not have to interact with others regularly Avoidant individuals also avoid performing activities in public spaces for fear of embarrassing themselves in front of others Symptoms include
BPOP generally presents with a 1 3 cm painless lump in a finger or more frequently a toe Growth can be rapid
Paratyphoid fever resembles typhoid fever Infection is characterized by a sustained fever headache abdominal pain malaise anorexia a nonproductive cough in early stage of illness a relative bradycardia slow heart rate and hepatosplenomegaly an enlargement of the liver and spleen About 30 of Caucasians develop rosy spots on the central body In adults constipation is more common than diarrhea Only 20 to 40 of people initially have abdominal pain Nonspecific symptoms such as chills sweating headache loss of appetite cough weakness sore throat dizziness and muscle pains are frequently present before the onset of fever Some very rare symptoms are psychosis mental disorder confusion and seizures
In general ulnar neuropathy will result in symptoms in a specific anatomic distribution affecting the little finger the ulnar half of the ring finger and the intrinsic muscles of the hand The specific symptoms experienced in the characteristic distribution depend on the specific location of ulnar nerve impingement Symptoms of ulnar neuropathy may be motor sensory or both depending on the location of injury Motor symptoms consistent of muscle weakness sensory symptoms or paresthesias consist of numbness or tingling in the areas innervated by the ulnar nerve Proximal impingement is associated with mixed symptoms as the proximal nerve consists of mixed sensory and motor innervation Distal impingement is associated with variable symptoms as the ulnar nerve separates near the hand into distinct motor and sensory branches In cubital tunnel syndrome a proximal impingement sensory and motor symptoms tend to occur in a certain sequence Initially there may be numbness of the small and ulnar fourth finger which may be transient If the impingement is not corrected the numbness may become constant and progress to hand weakness A characteristic resting hand position of ulnar claw where the small and ring fingers curl up occurs late in the disease and is a sign of severe neuropathy By contrast in Guyons canal syndrome distal impingement motor symptoms and claw hand may be more pronounced a phenomenon known as the ulnar paradox Also the back of the hand will have normal sensation
It generally presents with fragile skin that blisters and becomes red with or without trauma Marked scarring is left with thin skin milia and nail changes It typically begins around age 50 years
In one of the few reported cases the subject presented with muscle weakness and fatigue muscle twitching excessive sweating and salivation small joint pain itching and weight loss The subject also developed confusional episodes with spatial and temporal disorientation visual and auditory hallucinations complex behavior during sleep and progressive nocturnal insomnia associated with diurnal drowsiness There was also severe constipation urinary incontinence and excessive lacrimation When left alone the subject would slowly lapse into a stuporous state with dreamlike episodes characterized by complex and quasi purposeful gestures and movements enacted dreams Marked hyperhidrosis and excessive salivation were evident Neurological examination disclosed diffuse muscle twitching and spontaneous and reflex myoclonus slight muscle atrophy in the limbs absence of tendon reflexes in the lower limbs and diffuse erythema especially on the trunk with scratching lesions of the skin Compulsive behaviours stereotypies and reduplicative paramnesias can be part of the CNS spectrum
Up to 20 of those with calcific tendinitis have no symptoms For those with symptoms the symptoms vary based on the phase of the disease In the initial formative phase when the calcium deposits are being formed people rarely experience any symptoms Those that do have symptoms tend to have intermittent shoulder pain particularly during forward should flexion i e lifting the arm in front of the body In the resorptive phase when the calcium deposit is breaking down many experience severe acute pain that worsens at night Those affected tend to hold the shoulder rotated inwards to alleviate pain and have difficulty lying on the affected shoulder Some people experience heat and redness at the affected shoulder as well as a limited range of motion
Newborn children with WAGR syndrome are soon noted to have aniridia The clinical suspicion for WAGR may be increased with the presence of other genital anomalies though genitourinary anomalies are not always present particularly in girls In older children clinical diagnosis of the syndrome can be made when aniridia and one of the other features are present While aniridia is rarely absent in WAGR syndrome cases have been reported without it Chromosomal analysis is necessary for definitive diagnosis Other common eye defects include cataracts and ptosis About 50 of people develop Wilms tumour
Genetics Costello syndrome is caused by any of at least five different mutations in the HRAS gene on chromosome 11 This gene provides instructions for making a protein H Ras that helps control cell growth and division Mutations that cause Costello syndrome lead to the production of an H Ras protein that is permanently active Instead of triggering cell growth in response to particular signals from outside the cell the overactive protein directs cells to grow and divide constantly This unchecked cell division may predispose those affected to the development of benign and malignant tumors It remains unclear how mutations in HRAS cause other features of Costello syndrome but many of the signs and symptoms may result from cell overgrowth and abnormal cell division HRAS is a proto oncogene in which somatic mutations in healthy people can contribute to cancer Whereas children with Costello syndrome typically have a mutation in HRAS in every cell of their bodies an otherwise healthy person with a tumor caused in part by HRAS mutation will only have mutant HRAS within the tumor The test for the mutation in cancer tumors can also be used to test children for Costello syndrome Costello syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner which means one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the disorder Almost all cases have resulted from new mutations and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family This condition is rare as of 20 April 2007 200 to 300 cases have been reported worldwide
Mitral regurgitation may be present for many years before any symptoms appear The symptoms associated with MR are dependent on which phase of the disease process the individual is in Individuals with acute MR are typically severely symptomatic and will have the signs and symptoms of acute decompensated congestive heart failure i e shortness of breath pulmonary edema orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea In acute cases a murmur and tachycardia may be the only distinctive signs Individuals with chronic compensated MR may be asymptomatic for long periods of time with a normal exercise tolerance and no evidence of heart failure Over time however there may be decompensation and patients can develop volume overload congestive heart failure Symptoms of entry into a decompensated phase may include fatigue shortness of breath particularly on exertion and leg swelling Also there may be development of an irregular heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation Findings on clinical examination depend on the severity and duration of MR The mitral component of the first heart sound is usually soft and with a laterally displaced apex beat often with heave The first heart sound is followed by a high pitched holosystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the back or clavicular area Its duration is as the name suggests the whole of systole The loudness of the murmur does not correlate well with the severity of regurgitation It may be followed by a loud palpable P2 heard best when lying on the left side A third heart sound is commonly heard Patients with mitral valve prolapse may have a holosystolic murmur or often a mid to late systolic click and a late systolic murmur Cases with a late systolic regurgitant murmur may still be associated with significant hemodynamic consequences Mitral regurgitation as a result of papillary muscle damage or rupture may be a complication of a heart attack and lead to cardiogenic shock
The primary symptoms of hypotension are lightheadedness or dizziness If the blood pressure is sufficiently low fainting syncope may occur Low blood pressure is sometimes associated with certain symptoms many of which are related to causes rather than effects of hypotension
An estimated 60 of people infected with the fungi responsible for coccidioidomycosis have minimal to no symptoms while 40 will have a range of possible clinical symptoms Of those who do develop symptoms the primary infection is most often respiratory with symptoms resembling bronchitis or pneumonia that resolve over a matter of a few weeks In endemic regions coccidioidomycosis is responsible for 20 of cases of community acquired pneumonia Notable coccidioidomycosis signs and symptoms include a profound feeling of tiredness loss of smell and taste fever cough headaches rash muscle pain and joint pain Fatigue can persist for many months after initial infection The classic triad of coccidioidomycosis known as desert rheumatism includes the combination of fever joint pains and erythema nodosum A minority 3 5 of infected individuals do not recover from the initial acute infection and develop a chronic infection This can take the form of chronic lung infection or widespread disseminated infection affecting the tissues lining the brain soft tissues joints and bone Chronic infection is responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality Chronic fibrocavitary disease is manifested by cough sometimes productive of mucus fevers night sweats and weight loss Osteomyelitis including involvement of the spine and meningitis may occur months to years after initial infection Severe lung disease may develop in HIV infected persons
The symptoms of Filippi Syndrome can be congenital apparent as an infant The occurrence and severity of such symptoms are variable across affected individuals The progression of symptoms over ones lifetime has not been thoroughly studied due to the small number of people with Filippi Syndrome globally
Findings are due to brain stem and lower cranial nerve dysfunction Onset of symptoms are less likely to be present during adulthood in most patients Younger children generally have a substantially different presentation of clinical symptoms from older children Younger children are more likely to have a more rapid neurological degeneration with profound brain stem dysfunction over several days Neurogenic dysphagia Difficulty swallowing Seen by poor feeding in patient Cyanosis Bluish discoloration of skin while feeding Weak crying Facial weakness Aspiration Headaches aggravated by Valsalva maneuvers such as yawning laughing crying coughing sneezing or straining bending over or getting up suddenly Tinnitus ringing in the ears Lhermittes sign electrical sensation that runs down the back and into the limbs Vertigo dizziness Nausea Schmahmann syndrome Nystagmus irregular eye movements typically so called downbeat nystagmus Facial pain Muscle weakness Impaired gag reflex Dysphagia difficulty swallowing Restless leg syndrome Sleep apnea Sleep disorders Impaired coordination Severe cases may develop all the symptoms and signs of a bulbar palsy Paralysis due to pressure at the cervico medullary junction may progress in a so called clockwise fashion affecting the right arm then the right leg then the left leg and finally the left arm or the opposite way around Papilledema on fundoscopic exam due to Increased intracranial pressure Pupillary dilation Dysautonomia tachycardia rapid heart syncope fainting polydipsia extreme thirst chronic fatigue Apnea Sudden pause of breathing usually during sleep Opisthotonos Spasm of the head which causes head to arch backwards More common in infants than adults StridorThe blockage of cerebrospinal fluid CSF flow may also cause a syrinx to form eventually leading to syringomyelia Central cord symptoms such as hand weakness dissociated sensory loss and in severe cases paralysis may occur
The symptoms of a cystocele may include
Signs and symptoms of DIOS include a sudden onset of crampy abdominal pain vomiting and a palpable mass often in the right lower quadrant in the abdomen The characteristic abdominal pain is typically located in the center or right lower quadrant of the abdomen X rays of the abdomen may reveal stool in the colon and air fluid levels in the small intestines
Symptoms associated with scoliosis can include Pain in the back shoulders neck ribs and buttock pain nearest the bottom of the back Respiratory or cardiac problems in severe cases Constipation due to curvature causing tightening of the stomach intestines etc Limited mobility secondary to pain or functional limitation in adults mostly when twisting the torso The signs of scoliosis can include
The condition manifests as an allergic like reaction causing a warm red wheal to appear on the skin As it is often the result of scratches involving contact with other materials it can be confused with an allergic reaction when in fact it is the act of being scratched that causes a wheal to appear These wheals are a subset of urticaria hives and appear within minutes in some cases accompanied by itching The first outbreak of urticaria can lead to other reactions on body parts not directly stimulated scraped or scratched In a normal case the swelling will decrease without treatment within 15 30 minutes but in extreme cases itchy red welts may last anywhere from a few hours to days
LS can occur without symptoms White patches on the LS body area itching pain dyspareunia in genital LS easier bruising cracking tearing and peeling and hyperkeratosis are common symptoms in both men and women In women the condition most commonly occurs on the vulva and around the anus with ivory white elevations that may be flat and glistening In males the disease may take the form of whitish patches on the foreskin and its narrowing preputial stenosis forming an indurated ring which can make retraction more difficult or impossible phimosis In addition there can be lesions white patches or reddening on the glans In contrast to women anal involvement is less frequent Meatal stenosis making it more difficult or even impossible to urinate may also occur On the non genital skin the disease may manifest as porcelain white spots with small visible plugs inside the orifices of hair follicles or sweat glands on the surface Thinning of the skin may also occur
The signs and symptoms of frontal lobe disorder can be indicated by dysexecutive syndrome which consists of a number of symptoms which tend to occur together Broadly speaking these symptoms fall into three main categories cognitive movement and speech emotional or behavioral Although many of these symptoms regularly co occur it is common to encounter patients who have several but not all of these symptoms This is one reason why some researchers are beginning to argue that dysexecutive syndrome is not the best term to describe these various symptoms The fact that many of the dysexecutive syndrome symptoms can occur alone has led some researchers to suggest that the symptoms should not be labelled as a syndrome as such Some of the latest imaging research on frontal cortex areas suggests that executive functions may be more discrete than was previously thought Signs symptoms can be divided as follows
The signs and symptoms consistent with muscular dystrophy are
Clinical manifestations of HFpEF are similar to those observed in HFrEF and include shortness of breath including exercise induced dyspnea paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea exercise intolerance fatigue elevated jugular venous pressure and edema Patients with HFpEF poorly tolerate stress particularly hemodynamic alterations of ventricular loading or increased diastolic pressures Often there is a more dramatic elevation in systolic blood pressure in HFpEF than is typical of HFrEF
Gonorrhea infections of mucosal membranes can cause swelling itching pain and the formation of pus The time from exposure to symptoms is usually between two and 14 days with most symptoms appearing between four and six days after infection if they appear at all Both men and women with infections of the throat may experience a sore throat though such infection does not produce symptoms in 90 of cases Other symptoms may include swollen lymph nodes around the neck Either sex can become infected in the eyes or rectum if these tissues are exposed to the bacterium
People with WPW are usually asymptomatic when not having a fast heart rate However individuals may experience palpitations dizziness shortness of breath or infrequently syncope fainting or near fainting during episodes of supraventricular tachycardia WPW is also associated with a very small risk of sudden death due to more dangerous heart rhythm disturbances
Ventricular septal defect is usually symptomless at birth It usually manifests a few weeks after birth VSD is an acyanotic congenital heart defect aka a left to right shunt so there are no signs of cyanosis in the early stage However uncorrected VSD can increase pulmonary resistance leading to the reversal of the shunt and corresponding cyanosis Pansystolic Holosystolic murmur along lower left sternal border depending upon the size of the defect palpable thrill palpable turbulence of blood flow Heart sounds are normal Larger VSDs may cause a parasternal heave a displaced apex beat the palpable heartbeat moves laterally over time as the heart enlarges An infant with a large VSD will fail to thrive and become sweaty and tachypnoeic breathe faster with feeds The restrictive ventricular septal defects smaller defects are associated with a louder murmur and more palpable thrill grade IV murmur Larger defects may eventually be associated with pulmonary hypertension due to the increased blood flow Over time this may lead to an Eisenmengers syndrome the original VSD operating with a left to right shunt now becomes a right to left shunt because of the increased pressures in the pulmonary vascular bed
Yellow fever begins after an incubation period of three to six days Most cases cause only a mild infection with fever headache chills back pain fatigue loss of appetite muscle pain nausea and vomiting In these cases the infection lasts only three to six days But in 15 of cases people enter a second toxic phase of the disease characterized by recurring fever this time accompanied by jaundice due to liver damage as well as abdominal pain Bleeding in the mouth nose the eyes and the gastrointestinal tract cause vomit containing blood hence the Spanish name for yellow fever vómito negro black vomit There may also be kidney failure hiccups and delirium Among those who develop jaundice the fatality rate is 20 to 50 while the overall fatality rate is about 3 to 7 5 Severe cases may have a mortality greater than 50 Surviving the infection provides lifelong immunity and normally results in no permanent organ damage
Bite wounds can cause a number of signs and symptoms
The clinical manifestations of absence seizures vary significantly among patients Impairment of consciousness is the essential symptom and may be the only clinical symptom but this can be combined with other manifestations The hallmark of the absence seizures is abrupt and sudden onset impairment of consciousness interruption of ongoing activities a blank stare possibly a brief upward rotation of the eyes If the patient is speaking speech is slowed or interrupted if walking they stand transfixed if eating the food will stop on its way to the mouth Usually the patient will be unresponsive when addressed In some cases attacks are aborted when the patient is called The attack lasts from a few seconds to half a minute and evaporates as rapidly as it commenced Absence seizures generally are not followed by a period of disorientation or lethargy postictal state in contrast to the majority of seizure disorders Absence with impairment of consciousness only as per the above description Absence with mild clonic components Here the onset of the attack is indistinguishable from the above but clonic components may occur in the eyelids at the corner of the mouth or in other muscle groups which may vary in severity from almost imperceptible movements to generalised myoclonic jerks Objects held in the hand may be dropped Absence with atonic components Here there may be a diminution in tone of muscles subserving posture as well as in the limbs leading to dropping of the head occasionally slumping of the trunk dropping of the arms and relaxation of the grip Rarely tone is sufficiently diminished to cause this person to fall Absence with tonic components Here during the attack tonic muscular contraction may occur leading to increase in muscle tone which may affect the extensor muscles or the flexor muscles symmetrically or asymmetrically If the patient is standing the head may be drawn backward and the trunk may arch This may lead to retropulsion which may cause eyelids to twitch rapidly eyes may jerk upwards or the patients head may rock back and forth slowly as if nodding The head may tonically draw to one or another side Absence with automatisms Purposeful or quasi purposeful movements occurring in the absence of awareness during an absence attack are frequent and may range from lip licking and swallowing to clothes fumbling or aimless walking If spoken to the patient may grunt and when touched or tickled may rub the site Automatisms are quite elaborate and may consist of combinations of the above described movements or may be so simple as to be missed by casual observation Absence with autonomic components These may be pallor and less frequently flushing sweating dilatation of pupils and incontinence of urine Mixed forms of absence frequently occur These seizures can happen a few times a day or in some cases hundreds of times a day to the point that the person cannot concentrate in school or in other situations requiring sustained concentrated attention
The majority of people with a Meckels diverticulum are asymptomatic An asymptomatic Meckels diverticulum is called a silent Meckels diverticulum If symptoms do occur they typically appear before the age of two years The most common presenting symptom is painless rectal bleeding such as melaena like black offensive stools followed by intestinal obstruction volvulus and intussusception Occasionally Meckels diverticulitis may present with all the features of acute appendicitis Also severe pain in the epigastric region is experienced by the person along with bloating in the epigastric and umbilical regions At times the symptoms are so painful that they may cause sleepless nights with acute pain felt in the foregut region specifically in the epigastric and umbilical regions In some cases bleeding occurs without warning and may stop spontaneously The symptoms can be extremely painful often mistaken as just stomach pain resulting from not eating or constipation Rarely a Meckels diverticulum containing ectopic pancreatic tissue can present with abdominal pain and increased serum amylase levels mimicking acute pancreatitis
Symptoms include shoulder pain and limited range of motion although these symptoms are common in many shoulder conditions An important symptom of adhesive capsulitis is the severity of stiffness that often makes it nearly impossible to carry out simple arm movements Pain due to frozen shoulder is usually dull or aching and may be worse at night and with any motion The symptoms of primary frozen shoulder have been described as having three or four stages Sometimes a prodromal stage is described that can be present up to three months prior to the shoulder freezing During this stage people describe sharp pain at end ranges of motion achy pain at rest and sleep disturbances
The risk of alcohol dependence begins at low levels of drinking and increases directly with both the volume of alcohol consumed and a pattern of drinking larger amounts on an occasion to the point of intoxication which is sometimes called binge drinking
Chagas disease occurs in two stages an acute stage which develops one to two weeks after the insect bite and a chronic stage which develops over many years The acute stage is often symptom free When present the symptoms are typically minor and not specific to any particular disease Signs and symptoms include fever malaise headache and enlargement of the liver spleen and lymph nodes Sometimes people develop a swollen nodule at the site of infection which is called Romañas sign if it is on the eyelid or a chagoma if it is elsewhere on the skin In rare cases less than 1 5 infected individuals develop severe acute disease which can involve inflammation of the heart muscle fluid accumulation around the heart and inflammation of the brain and surrounding tissues and may be life threatening The acute phase typically lasts four to eight weeks and resolves without treatment Unless treated with antiparasitic drugs individuals remain infected with T cruzi after recovering from the acute phase Most chronic infections are asymptomatic which is referred to as indeterminate chronic Chagas disease However over decades with the disease approximately 30 40 of people develop organ dysfunction determinate chronic Chagas disease which most often affects the heart or digestive system The most common long term manifestation is heart disease which occurs in 14 45 of people with chronic Chagas disease People with Chagas heart disease often experience heart palpitations and sometimes fainting due to irregular heart function By electrocardiogram people with Chagas heart disease most frequently have arrhythmias As the disease progresses the hearts ventricles become enlarged dilated cardiomyopathy which reduces its ability to pump blood In many cases the first sign of Chagas heart disease is heart failure thromboembolism or chest pain associated with abnormalities in the microvasculature Also common in chronic Chagas disease is damage to the digestive system which affects 10 21 of people Enlargement of the esophagus or colon are the most common digestive issues Those with enlarged esophagus often experience pain odynophagia or trouble swallowing dysphagia acid reflux cough and weight loss Individuals with enlarged colon often experience constipation and may develop severe blockage of the intestine or its blood supply Up to 10 of chronically infected individuals develop nerve damage that can result in numbness and altered reflexes or movement While chronic disease typically develops over decades some individuals with Chagas disease less than 10 progress to heart damage directly after acute disease Signs and symptoms differ for people infected with T cruzi through less common routes People infected through ingestion of parasites tend to develop severe disease within three weeks of consumption with symptoms including fever vomiting shortness of breath cough and pain in the chest abdomen and muscles Those infected congenitally typically have few to no symptoms but can have mild non specific symptoms or severe symptoms such as jaundice respiratory distress and heart problems People infected through organ transplant or blood transfusion tend to have symptoms similar to those of vector borne disease but the symptoms may not manifest for anywhere from a week to five months Chronically infected individuals who become immunosuppressed due to HIV infection can have particularly severe and distinct disease most commonly characterized by inflammation in the brain and surrounding tissue or brain abscesses Symptoms vary widely based on the size and location of brain abscesses but typically include fever headaches seizures loss of sensation or other neurological issues that indicate particular sites of nervous system damage Occasionally these individuals also experience acute heart inflammation skin lesions and disease of the stomach intestine or peritoneum
Skin and mucosa Nearly all people with Behçets disease present with some form of painful ulcerations inside the mouth They are a form of aphthous ulcers or non scarring oral lesions The oral lesions are similar to those found in inflammatory bowel disease and can be relapsing Painful genital ulcerations usually develop around the anus vulva or scrotum and cause scarring in 75 percent of the patients Additionally patients may present with erythema nodosum cutaneous pustular vasculitis and lesions similar to pyoderma gangrenosum
The symptoms of Feltys syndrome are similar to those of rheumatoid arthritis Affected individuals have painful stiff and swollen joints most commonly in the joints of the hands feet and arms In some affected individuals Feltys syndrome may develop during a period when the symptoms and physical findings associated with rheumatoid arthritis have subsided or are not present in this case Feltys syndrome may remain undiagnosed In more rare instances the development of Feltys syndrome may precede the development of the symptoms and physical findings associated with rheumatoid arthritis Feltys syndrome is also characterized by an abnormally enlarged spleen splenomegaly and abnormally low levels of certain white blood cells neutropenia As a result of neutropenia affected individuals are increasingly susceptible to certain infections Keratoconjunctivitis sicca may occur due to secondary Sjögrens syndrome Individuals with Feltys syndrome may also experience fever weight loss and or fatigue In some cases affected individuals may have discoloration abnormal brown pigmentation of the skin particularly of the leg sores ulcers on the lower leg and or an abnormally large liver hepatomegaly In addition affected individuals may have abnormally low levels of circulating red blood cells anemia a decrease in circulating blood platelets that assist in blood clotting functions thrombocytopenia abnormal liver function tests and or inflammation of the blood vessels vasculitis
People with monoclonal gammopathy generally do not experience signs or symptoms Some people may experience a rash or nerve problems such as numbness or tingling MGUS is usually detected by chance when the patient has a blood test for another condition or as part of standard screening
The key of FASD can vary between individuals exposed to alcohol during pregnancy While consensus exists for the definition and diagnosis of FAS minor variations among the systems lead to differences in definitions and diagnostic cut off criteria for other diagnoses across the FASD continuum The central nervous system damage criteria particularly lacks clear consensus A working knowledge of the key features is helpful in understanding FASD diagnoses and conditions and each is reviewed with attention to similarities and differences across the four diagnostic systems More than 400 problems however can occur with FASD
Symptoms of invasive candidiasis can be confused with other medical conditions however the most common symptoms are fever and chills that do not improve with antibiotic treatment Other symptoms develop as the infection spreads depending on which parts of the body are involved
Early research into GSD I identified numerous clinical manifestations falsely thought to be primary features of the genetic disorder However continuing research has revealed that these clinical features are the consequences of only one in GSD Ia or two in GSD Ib fundamental abnormalities
The main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis People with liver problems tend to come for medical attention earlier generally as children or teenagers than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms who tend to be in their twenties or older Some are identified only because relatives have been diagnosed with Wilsons disease many of these when tested turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis
The clinical presentation of CST can be varied Both acute fulminant disease and indolent subacute presentations have been reported in the literature The most common signs of CST are related to anatomical structures affected within the cavernous sinus notably cranial nerves III VI as well as symptoms resulting from impaired venous drainage from the orbit and eye Classic presentations are abrupt onset of unilateral periorbital edema headache photophobia and bulging of the eye exophthalmos Other common signs and symptoms include Ptosis chemosis cranial nerve palsies III IV V VI Sixth nerve palsy is the most common Sensory deficits of the ophthalmic and maxillary branch of the fifth nerve are common Periorbital sensory loss and impaired corneal reflex may be noted Papilledema retinal hemorrhages and decreased visual acuity and blindness may occur from venous congestion within the retina Fever tachycardia and sepsis may be present Headache with nuchal rigidity neck stiffness may occur One or both pupils may be dilated and sluggishly reactive Infection can spread to contralateral cavernous sinus within 24 48 hours of initial presentation
The common signs and symptoms of a torn meniscus are knee pain particularly along the joint line and swelling These are worse when the knee bears more weight for example when running Another typical complaint is joint locking when the affected person is unable to straighten the leg fully This can be accompanied by a clicking feeling Sometimes a meniscal tear also causes a sensation that the knee gives way A person with a torn meniscus can sometimes remember a specific activity during which the injury was sustained A tear of the meniscus commonly follows a trauma that involves rotation of the knee while it was slightly bent These maneuvers also exacerbate the pain after the injury for example getting out of a car is often reported as painful
The symptoms of laryngeal cancer depend on the size and location of the tumour Symptoms may include the following Hoarseness or other voice changes A lump in the neck A sore throat or feeling that something is stuck in the throat Persistent cough Stridor a high pitched wheezing sound indicative of a narrowed or obstructed airway Bad breath Earache due to referred pain Difficulty swallowingAdverse effects of treatment can include changes in appearance difficulty eating dry mouth or loss of voice that may require learning alternate methods of speaking
Most of the women who develop DCIS do not experience any symptoms The majority of cases 80 85 are detected through screening mammography The first signs and symptoms may appear if the cancer advances Because of the lack of early symptoms DCIS is most often detected at screening mammography In a few cases DCIS may cause
Symptoms of CMT usually begin in early childhood or early adulthood but can begin later Some people do not experience symptoms until their early 30s or 40s Usually the initial symptom is foot drop early in the course of the disease This can also cause hammertoe where the toes are always curled Wasting of muscle tissue of the lower parts of the legs may give rise to a stork leg or inverted champagne bottle appearance Weakness in the hands and forearms occurs in many people as the disease progresses Loss of touch sensation in the feet ankles and legs as well as in the hands wrists and arms occurs with various types of the disease Early and late onset forms occur with on and off painful spasmodic muscular contractions that can be disabling when the disease activates High arched feet pes cavus or flat arched feet pes planus are classically associated with the disorder Sensory and proprioceptive nerves in the hands and feet are often damaged while unmyelinated pain nerves are left intact Overuse of an affected hand or limb can activate symptoms including numbness spasm and painful cramping Symptoms and progression of the disease can vary Involuntary grinding of teeth and squinting are prevalent and often go unnoticed by the person affected Breathing can be affected in some as can hearing vision and neck and shoulder muscles Scoliosis is common causing hunching and loss of height Hip sockets can be malformed Gastrointestinal problems can be part of CMT as can difficulty chewing swallowing and speaking due to atrophy of vocal cords A tremor can develop as muscles waste Pregnancy has been known to exacerbate CMT as well as severe emotional stress Patients with CMT must avoid periods of prolonged immobility such as when recovering from a secondary injury as prolonged periods of limited mobility can drastically accelerate symptoms of CMT Pain due to postural changes skeletal deformations muscle fatigue and cramping is fairly common in people with CMT It can be mitigated or treated by physical therapies surgeries and corrective or assistive devices Analgesic medications may also be needed if other therapies do not provide relief from pain Neuropathic pain is often a symptom of CMT though like other symptoms of CMT its presence and severity vary from case to case For some people pain can be significant to severe and interfere with daily life activities However pain is not experienced by all people with CMT When neuropathic pain is present as a symptom of CMT it is comparable to that seen in other peripheral neuropathies as well as postherpetic neuralgia and complex regional pain syndrome among other diseases
Bad breath is when a noticeably unpleasant odour is believed to be present on the breath It can result in anxiety among those affected It is also associated with depression and symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder
The symptoms of TR depend on its severity Severe TR causes right sided heart failure with the development of ascites and peripheral edema A pansystolic heart murmur may be heard on auscultation of the chest The murmur is usually of low frequency and best heard on the lower left sternal border It increases with inspiration and decreases with expiration this is known as Carvallos sign However the murmur may be inaudible due to the relatively low pressures in the right side of the heart A third heart sound may also be present also heard at the lower sternal border and increasing in intensity with inspiration On examination of the neck there may be giant C V waves in the jugular pulse With severe TR there may be an enlarged liver detected on palpation of the right upper quadrant of the abdomen the liver may be pulsatile on palpation and even on inspection
Aching heavy legs Appearance of spider veins telangiectasia in the affected leg Ankle swelling A brownish yellow shiny skin discoloration near the affected veins Redness dryness and itchiness of areas of skin termed stasis dermatitis or venous eczema Muscle cramps when making sudden movements such as standing Abnormal bleeding or healing time for injuries in the affected area Lipodermatosclerosis or shrinking skin near the ankles Restless legs syndrome appears to be a common overlapping clinical syndrome in people with varicose veins and other chronic venous insufficiency Atrophie blanche or white scar like formations Burning or throbbing sensation in the legsPeople with varicose veins might have a positive D dimer blood test result due to chronic low level thrombosis within dilated veins varices
SCC of the skin begins as a small nodule and as it enlarges the center becomes necrotic and sloughs and the nodule turns into an ulcer and generally are developed from an actinic keratosis Once keratinocytes begin to grow uncontrollably they have the potential to become cancerous and produce squamous cell carcinoma The lesion caused by SCC is often asymptomatic Ulcer or reddish skin plaque that is slow growing Intermittent bleeding from the tumor especially on the lip The clinical appearance is highly variable Usually the tumor presents as an ulcerated lesion with hard raised edges The tumor may be in the form of a hard plaque or a papule often with an opalescent quality with tiny blood vessels The tumor can lie below the level of the surrounding skin and eventually ulcerates and invades the underlying tissue The tumor commonly presents on sun exposed areas e g back of the hand scalp lip and superior surface of pinna On the lip the tumor forms a small ulcer which fails to heal and bleeds intermittently Evidence of chronic skin photodamage as in multiple actinic keratoses solar keratoses The tumor grows relatively slowly
No single diagnostic test currently exists to predict the likelihood of developing gestational hypertension High blood pressure is the major sign in diagnosing gestational hypertension Some women with gestational hypertension may present asymptomatic but a number of symptoms are associated with the condition 1 Symptoms
Most people with essential thrombocythemia are without symptoms at the time of diagnosis which is usually made after noting an elevated platelet level on a routine complete blood count CBC The most common symptoms are bleeding due to dysfunctional platelets blood clots e g deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism fatigue headache nausea vomiting abdominal pain visual disturbances dizziness fainting and numbness in the extremities the most common signs are increased white blood cell count reduced red blood cell count and an enlarged spleen
Transient synovitis causes pain in the hip thigh groin or knee on the affected side However children with transient synovitis of the hip can usually weight bear with varying degrees of limping There may be a limp or abnormal crawling in infants with or without pain In small infants the presenting complaint can be unexplained crying for example when changing a diaper The condition is nearly always limited to one side The pain and limp can range from mild to severe Some children may have a slightly raised temperature high fever and general malaise point to other more serious conditions On clinical examination the child typically holds the hip slightly bent turned outwards and away from the middle line flexion external rotation and abduction Active and passive movements may be limited because of pain especially abduction and internal rotation The hip can be tender to palpation The log roll test involves gently rotating the entire lower limb inwards and outwards with the patient on his back to check when muscle guarding occurs The unaffected hip and the knees ankles feet and spine are found to be normal
Signs and symptoms of malrotation vary depending on if the patient is suffering from an acute volvulus or experiencing chronic symptoms If the patient most often an infant presents acutely with midgut volvulus it is usually manifested by bilious vomiting crampy abdominal pain abdominal distention and in late cases the passage of blood and mucus in their stools Patients with chronic uncorrected or undiagnosed malrotation can have recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting Malrotation may be asymptomatic
ITBS symptoms range from a stinging sensation just above the knee and outside of the knee lateral side of the knee joint to swelling or thickening of the tissue in the area where the band moves over the femur The stinging sensation just above the knee joint is felt on the outside of the knee or along the entire length of the iliotibial band Pain may not occur immediately during activity but may intensify over time Pain is most commonly felt when the foot strikes the ground and pain might persist after activity Pain may also be present above and below the knee where the ITB attaches to the tibia
Signs and symptoms of corneal abrasion include pain trouble with bright lights a foreign body sensation excessive squinting and reflex production of tears Signs include epithelial defects and edema and often redness of the eye The vision may be blurred both from any swelling of the cornea and from excess tears Crusty buildup from excess tears may also be present
Most Bartholins cysts do not cause any symptoms although some may cause pain during walking sitting or sexual intercourse dyspareunia They are usually between 1 and 4 cm and are located just medial to the labia minora Most Bartholins cysts only affect the left or the right side unilateral While small cysts are usually not painful larger cysts can cause significant pain
Mild or early cases of Pagets are asymptomatic and so most people are diagnosed with Pagets disease incidentally during medical evaluation for another problem Approximately 35 of patients with Pagets have symptoms related to the disease when they are first diagnosed Overall the most common symptom is bone pain When symptoms do occur they may be confused with those of arthritis or other disorders and so diagnosis may be delayed Pagets may first be noticed as an increasing deformity of a persons bones Pagets disease affecting the skull may cause frontal bossing increased hat size and headaches Often patients may develop loss of hearing in one or both ears due to auditory foramen narrowing and resultant compression of the nerves in the inner ear Rarely skull involvement may lead to compression of the nerves that supply the eye leading to vision loss
In both the American Psychiatric Associations DSM 5 and the World Health Organizations ICD 10 the same criteria used to diagnose bipolar disorder in adults are used to make the diagnosis in children with some adjustments to account for differences in age and developmental stage For example the DSM 5 specifies that in children depressive episodes can manifest as persistently irritable moods In diagnosing manic episodes it is important to compare the changes in mood and behavior to the childs normal mood and behaviors at baseline instead of to other children or adults For example grandiosity i e unrealistic overestimation of ones intelligence talent or abilities is normal at varying degrees during childhood and adolescence Therefore grandiosity is only considered symptomatic of mania in children when the beliefs are held despite being presented with concrete evidence otherwise or when they lead to a child attempting activities that are clearly dangerous and most importantly when the grandiose beliefs are an obvious change from that particular childs normal self view in between episodes
Because pulmonic regurgitation is the result of other factors in the body any noticeable symptoms are ultimately caused by an underlying medical condition rather than the regurgitation itself However more severe regurgitation may contribute to right ventricular enlargement by dilation and in later stages right heart failure A diastolic decrescendo murmur can sometimes be identified heard best over the left lower sternal border
Stomach cancer is often either asymptomatic producing no noticeable symptoms or it may cause only nonspecific symptoms which may also be present in other related or unrelated disorders in its early stages By the time symptoms are recognized the cancer has often reached an advanced stage see below and may have metastasized spread to other perhaps distant parts of the body which is one of the main reasons for its relatively poor prognosis Stomach cancer can cause the following signs and symptoms Unexplained nausea vomiting diarrhoea and constipation Patients also can experience unexplained weight loss Early cancers may be associated with indigestion or a burning sensation heartburn However fewer than one in every 50 people referred for endoscopy due to indigestion has cancer Abdominal discomfort and loss of appetite especially for meat can occur Gastric cancers that have enlarged and invaded normal tissue can cause weakness fatigue bloating of the stomach after meals abdominal pain in the upper abdomen nausea and occasional vomiting Further enlargement may cause weight loss or bleeding with vomiting blood or having blood in the stool the latter apparent as black discolouration melena and sometimes leading to anemia Dysphagia suggests a tumour in the cardia or extension of the gastric tumour into the esophagus These can be symptoms of other problems such as a stomach virus gastric ulcer or tropical sprue
SARS produces flu like symptoms which may include fever muscle pain lethargy cough sore throat and other nonspecific symptoms The only symptom common to all patients appears to be a fever above 38 C 100 F SARS often leads to shortness of breath and pneumonia which may be direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia The average incubation period for SARS is 4 6 days although it is rarely as short as 1 day or as long as 14 days
Calcinosis CREST causes thickening and tightening of the skin with deposition of calcific nodules calcinosis
Around 85 of people infected with Chikungunya virus experience symptoms typically beginning with a sudden high fever above 39 C 102 F The fever is soon followed by severe muscle and joint pain Pain usually affects multiple joints in the arms and legs and is symmetric i e if one elbow is affected the other is as well People with Chikungunya also frequently experience headache back pain nausea and fatigue Around half of those affected develop a rash with reddening and sometimes small bumps on the palms foot soles torso and face For some the rash remains constrained to a small part of the body for others the rash can be extensive covering more than 90 of the skin Some people experience gastrointestinal issues with abdominal pain and vomiting Others experience eye problems namely sensitivity to light conjunctivitis and pain behind the eye This first set of symptoms called the acute phase of Chikungunya lasts around a week after which most symptoms resolve on their own Many people continue to have symptoms after the acute phase resolves termed the post acute phase for symptoms lasting three weeks to three months and the chronic stage for symptoms lasting longer than three months In both cases the lasting symptoms tend to be joint pains arthritis tenosynovitis and or bursitis If the affected person had pre existing joint issues these tend to worsen Overuse of a joint can result in painful swelling stiffness nerve damage and neuropathic pain Typically the joint pain improves with time however the chronic stage can last anywhere from a few months to several years Joint pain is reported in 87 98 of cases and nearly always occurs in more than one joint though joint swelling is uncommon Typically the affected joints are located in both arms and legs Joints are more likely to be affected if they have previously been damaged by disorders such as arthritis Pain most commonly occurs in peripheral joints such as the wrists ankles and joints of the hands and feet as well as some of the larger joints typically the shoulders elbows and knees Pain may also occur in the muscles or ligaments In more than half of cases normal activity is limited by significant fatigue and pain Infrequently inflammation of the eyes may occur in the form of iridocyclitis or uveitis and retinal lesions may occur Temporary damage to the liver may occur People with Chikungunya occasionally develop neurologic disorders most frequently swelling or degeneration of the brain inflammation or degneration of the myelin sheaths around neurons Guillain Barré syndrome acute disseminated encephalomyelitis hypotonia in newborns and issues with visual processing In particularly rare cases people may develop behavioral changes seizures irritation of the cerebellum or meninges oculomotor nerve palsy or paralysis of the eye muscles Newborns are susceptible to particularly severe effects of Chikungunya infection Signs of infection typically begin with fever rash and swelling at the extremities Around half of newborns have a mild case of the disease that resolves on its own the other half have severe disease with inflammation of the brain and seizures In severe cases affected newborns may also have issues with bleeding and bloodflow and problems with heart function In addition to newborns the elderly and those with diabetes heart disease liver and kidney diseases and human immunodeficiency virus infection tend to have more severe cases of Chikungunya Around 1 to 5 in 1 000 people with symptomatic Chikungunya die of the disease
When an individual has an ACL injury they are likely to hear a pop in their knee followed by pain and swelling They may also experience instability in the knee once they resume walking and other activities as the ligament can no longer stabilize the knee joint and keep the tibia from sliding forward Reduced range of motion of the knee and tenderness along the joint line are also common signs of an acute ACL injury The pain and swelling may resolve on its own however the knee will remain unstable and returning to sport without treatment may result in further damage to the knee
Rotor syndrome has many features in common with Dubin Johnson syndrome an exception being that the liver cells are not pigmented The main symptom is a non itching jaundice There is a rise in bilirubin in the patients serum mainly of the conjugated type It can be differentiated from Dubin Johnson syndrome in the following ways Rotor syndrome may exacerbate toxic side effects of the medication irinotecan
The infection causes a red intensely pruritic itchy eruption and may look like twirling lesions The itching can become very painful and if scratched may allow a secondary bacterial infection to develop Cutaneous larva migrans usually heals spontaneously over weeks to months and has been known to last as long as one year However the severity of the symptoms usually causes those infected to seek medical treatment before spontaneous resolution occurs Following proper treatment migration of the larvae within the skin is halted and relief of the associated itching can occur in less than 48 hours reported for thiabendazole This is separate from the similar cutaneous larva currens which is caused by Strongyloides Larva currens is also a cause of migratory pruritic eruptions but is marked by 1 migratory speed on the order of inches per hour 2 perianal involvement due to autoinfection from stool and 3 a wide band of urticaria
Symptoms may include headache nausea or vomiting Chest pain may occur due to increased workload on the heart resulting in inadequate delivery of oxygen to meet the heart muscles metabolic needs The kidneys may be affected resulting in blood or protein in the urine and acute kidney failure People can have decreased urine production fluid retention and confusion Other signs and symptoms can include Chest pain Abnormal heart rhythms Headache Nosebleeds that are difficult to stop Dyspnea Fainting or the sensation of the world spinning around them vertigo Severe anxiety Agitation Altered mental status Abnormal sensationsThe most common presentations of hypertensive emergencies are cerebral infarction 24 5 pulmonary edema 22 5 hypertensive encephalopathy 16 3 and congestive heart failure 12 Less common presentations include intracranial bleeding aortic dissection and pre eclampsia or eclampsia Massive rapid elevations in blood pressure can trigger any of these symptoms and warrant further work up by physicians Physical exam would include measurement of blood pressure in both arms Laboratory tests to be conducted include urine toxicology blood glucose a basic metabolic panel evaluating kidney function or a complete metabolic panel evaluating liver function EKG chest x rays and pregnancy screening The eyes may show bleeding in the retina an exudate cotton wool spots scattered splinter hemorrhages or swelling of the optic disc called papilledema
Fifth disease starts with a low grade fever headache rash and cold like symptoms such as a runny or stuffy nose These symptoms pass then a few days later the rash appears The bright red rash most commonly appears in the face particularly the cheeks This is a defining symptom of the infection in children hence the name slapped cheek disease Occasionally the rash will extend over the bridge of the nose or around the mouth In addition to red cheeks children often develop a red lacy rash on the rest of the body with the upper arms torso and legs being the most common locations The rash typically lasts a few days and may itch some cases have been known to last for several weeks Patients are usually no longer infectious once the rash has appeared Teenagers and adults may present with a self limited arthritis It manifests in painful swelling of the joints that feels similar to arthritis Older children and adults with fifth disease may have difficulty in walking and in bending joints such as wrists knees ankles fingers and shoulders The disease is usually mild but in certain risk groups and rare circumstances it can have serious consequences
More than 30 signs and symptoms are variably associated with Marfan syndrome The most prominent of these affect the skeletal cardiovascular and ocular systems but all fibrous connective tissue throughout the body can be affected
Most people who are infected have no or few symptoms Otherwise the most common signs and symptoms of Zika fever are fever rash conjunctivitis red eyes muscle and joint pain and headache which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever The time from a mosquito bite to developing symptoms is not yet known but is probably a few days to a week The disease lasts for several days to a week and is usually mild enough that people do not have to go to a hospital Due to being in the same family as dengue there has been concern that it could cause similar bleeding disorders However that has only been documented in one case with blood seen in semen also known as hematospermia
The hallmark symptom of Sjögren syndrome is dry mouth and keratoconjunctivitis sicca dry eyes Vaginal dryness dry skin and dry nose may also occur Other organs of the body may also be affected including the kidneys blood vessels lungs liver pancreas and brain Skin dryness in some people with SS may be the result of lymphocytic infiltration into skin glands The symptoms may develop insidiously with the diagnosis often not considered for several years because sicca may be attributed to medications a dry environment or aging or may be regarded as not of a severity warranting the level of investigation necessary to establish the presence of the underlying autoimmune disorder Sjögrens syndrome can damage vital organs with symptoms that may plateau or worsen or go into remission as with other autoimmune diseases Some people may experience only the mild symptoms of dry eyes and mouth while others have symptoms of severe disease Many patients can treat problems symptomatically Others experience blurred vision constant eye discomfort recurrent mouth infections swollen parotid glands dysphonia vocal disorders including hoarseness and difficulty in swallowing and eating Debilitating fatigue and joint pain can seriously impair quality of life Some patients can develop kidney involvement autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis leading to proteinuria excess protein in urine urinary concentrating defect and distal renal tubular acidosis Hypokalemic paralysis due to primary Sjögren syndrome was rarely reported in the literature
Signs of hemolytic disease of the newborn include a positive direct Coombs test also called direct agglutination test elevated cord bilirubin levels and hemolytic anemia It is possible for a newborn with this disease to have neutropenia and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia as well Hemolysis leads to elevated bilirubin levels After delivery bilirubin is no longer cleared via the placenta from the neonates blood and the symptoms of jaundice yellowish skin and yellow discoloration of the whites of the eyes or icterus increase within 24 hours after birth Like other forms of severe neonatal jaundice there is the possibility of the neonate developing acute or chronic kernicterus however the risk of kernicterus in HDN is higher because of the rapid and massive destruction of blood cells It is important to note that isoimmunization is a risk factor for neurotoxicity and lowers the level at which kernicterus can occur Untreated profound anemia can cause high output heart failure with pallor enlarged liver and or spleen generalized swelling and respiratory distress HDN can be the cause of hydrops fetalis an often severe form of prenatal heart failure that causes fetal edema
Common constitutional signs and symptoms of the HFMD include fever nausea vomiting feeling tired generalized discomfort loss of appetite and irritability in infants and toddlers Skin lesions frequently develop in the form of a rash of flat discolored spots and bumps which may be followed by vesicular sores with blisters on palms of the hands soles of the feet buttocks and sometimes on the lips The rash is rarely itchy for children but can be extremely itchy for adults Painful facial ulcers blisters or lesions may also develop in or around the nose or mouth HFMD usually resolves on its own after 7 10 days Most cases of the disease are relatively harmless but complications including encephalitis meningitis and paralysis that mimics the neurological symptoms of polio can occur
Molluscum contagiosum lesions are flesh colored dome shaped and pearly in appearance They are often 1 5 mm in diameter with a dimpled center Molluscum lesions are most commonly found on the face arms legs torso and armpits in children Adults typically have molluscum lesions in the genital region and this is considered to be a sexually transmitted infection because of this if genital lesions are found on a child sexual abuse should be suspected These lesions are generally not painful but they may itch or become irritated Picking or scratching the bumps may lead to a spread of the viral infection responsible for molluscum contagiosum an additional bacterial infection and scarring In some cases eczema develops around the lesions Individual molluscum lesions may go away on their own within two months and generally clear completely without treatment or scarring in six to twelve months Mean durations for an outbreak are variously reported from eight to about 18 months but durations are reported as widely as six months to five years lasting longer in immunosuppressed individuals
Symptoms may occur at any time but most often they accompany a change of body position Pedunculated myxomata can have a wrecking ball effect as they lead to stasis and may eventually embolize themselves Symptoms may include Shortness of breath with activity Platypnea Difficulty breathing in the upright position with relief in the supine position Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea Breathing difficulty when asleep Dizziness Fainting Palpitations Sensation of feeling your heart beat Chest pain or tightness Sudden Death In which case the disease is an autopsy finding The symptoms and signs of left atrial myxomata often mimic mitral stenosis General symptoms may also be present such as Cough Pulmonary edema as blood backs up into the pulmonary artery after increased pressures in the left atrium and atrial dilation Hemoptysis Fever Cachexia Involuntary weight loss General discomfort malaise Joint pain Blue discoloration of the skin especially the fingers change color upon pressure cold or stress Raynauds phenomenon Clubbing Curvature of nails accompanied with soft tissue enlargement of the fingers Swelling any part of the body Presystolic heart murmurThese general symptoms may also mimic those of infective endocarditis
In mild cases children may show no signs or symptoms at first and their condition may not be diagnosed until later in life Some children born with coarctation of the aorta have additional heart defects such as aortic stenosis ventricular septal defect patent ductus arteriosus or mitral valve abnormalities Coarctation is about twice as common in boys as it is in girls It is frequently found in girls who have Turner syndrome Symptoms may be absent with mild narrowings coarctation When present they include breathing difficulties poor appetite or trouble feeding and failure to thrive Later on children may develop symptoms related to problems with blood flow and an enlarged heart They may experience dizziness or shortness of breath fainting or near fainting episodes chest pain abnormal tiredness or fatigue headaches or nosebleeds They have cold legs and feet or have pain in their legs with exercise intermittent claudication In cases of more severe coarctations babies may develop serious problems soon after birth because not enough blood can get through the aorta to the rest of their body Arterial hypertension in the arms with low blood pressure in the lower extremities is classic In the lower extremities weak pulses in the femoral arteries and arteries of the feet are found The coarctation typically occurs after the left subclavian artery However if situated before it blood flow to the left arm is compromised and asynchronous or radial pulses of different strength may be detected normal on the right arm weak or delayed on the left termed radio radial delay In these cases a difference between the normal radial pulse in the right arm and the delayed femoral pulse in the legs either side may be apparent whilst no such delay would be appreciated with palpation of both delayed left arm and either femoral pulses On the other hand a coarctation occurring after the left subclavian artery will produce synchronous radial pulses but radio femoral delay will be present under palpation in either arm both arm pulses are normal compared to the delayed leg pulses
Concussions symptoms vary between people and include physical cognitive and emotional symptoms Symptoms may appear immediately or be delayed Up to one third of people with concussion experience prolonged or persistent concussion symptoms also known as post concussion syndrome which is defined as concussion symptoms lasting for 4 weeks or longer in children adolescents and symptoms lasting for more than 14 days in an adult The severity of the initial symptoms is the strongest predictor of recovery time in adults
Signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorder vary in their presentation The symptoms will usually involve more than one of the various components of the masticatory system muscles nerves tendons ligaments bones connective tissue or the teeth The three classically described cardinal signs and symptoms of TMD are Pain and tenderness on palpation in the muscles of mastication or of the joint itself preauricular pain pain felt just in front of the ear Pain is the defining feature of TMD and is usually aggravated by manipulation or function such as when chewing clenching or yawning and is often worse upon waking The character of the pain is usually dull or aching poorly localized and intermittent although it can sometimes be constant The pain is more usually unilateral located on one side rather than bilateral It is rarely severe Limited range of mandibular movement which may cause difficulty eating or even talking There may be locking of the jaw or stiffness in the jaw muscles and the joints especially present upon waking There may also be incoordination asymmetry or deviation of mandibular movement Noises from the joint during mandibular movement which may be intermittent Joint noises may be described as clicking popping or crepitus grating TMJ dysfunction is commonly associated with symptoms affecting cervical spine dysfunction and altered head and cervical spine posture Other signs and symptoms have also been described although these are less common and less significant than the cardinal signs and symptoms listed above Examples include
The major clinical features are prolonged watery diarrhea fasting stool volume 750 to 1000 mL day and symptoms of hypokalemia and dehydration Half of the patients have relatively constant diarrhea while the rest have alternating periods of severe and moderate diarrhea One third have diarrhea 1yr before diagnosis but in 25 diarrhea is present for 5 yr or more before diagnosis Lethargy muscle weakness nausea vomiting and crampy abdominal pain are frequent symptoms Hypokalemia and impaired glucose tolerance occur in 50 of patients Achlorhydria is also a feature During attacks of diarrhea flushing similar to the carcinoid syndrome occur rarely
Loss of appetite and weight loss can occur Additional signs are weakness sore tongue headaches heart palpitations irritability and behavioral disorders In adults anemia macrocytic megaloblastic anemia can be a sign of advanced folate deficiency Women with folate deficiency who become pregnant are more likely to give birth to low birth weight premature infants and infants with neural tube defects and even spina bifida In infants and children folate deficiency can lead to failure to thrive or slow growth rate diarrhea oral ulcers megaloblastic anemia neurological deterioration An abnormally small head irritability developmental delay seizures blindness and cerebellar ataxia can also be observed
Most people who brux are unaware of the problem either because there are no symptoms or because the symptoms are not understood to be associated with a clenching and grinding problem The symptoms of sleep bruxism are usually most intense immediately after waking and then slowly abate and the symptoms of a grinding habit which occurs mainly while awake tend to worsen through the day and may not be present on waking Bruxism may cause a variety of signs and symptoms including
Typically people infected with dengue virus are asymptomatic 80 or have only mild symptoms such as an uncomplicated fever Others have more severe illness 5 and in a small proportion it is life threatening The incubation period time between exposure and onset of symptoms ranges from 3 to 14 days but most often it is 4 to 7 days Therefore travelers returning from endemic areas are unlikely to have dengue fever if symptoms start more than 14 days after arriving home Children often experience symptoms similar to those of the common cold and gastroenteritis vomiting and diarrhea and have a greater risk of severe complications though initial symptoms are generally mild but include high fever
A small unchanging aneurysm will produce few if any symptoms Before a larger aneurysm ruptures the individual may experience such symptoms as a sudden and unusually severe headache nausea vision impairment vomiting and loss of consciousness or no symptoms at all
Fever Symptoms begin with a three to six day febrile illness During this time temperatures can peak above 40 C and children can experience increased irritability with general malaise However many children in the febrile phase feel well engaged and alert For these patients fever is usually diagnosed incidentally The most common complication 10 15 of children between 6 and 18 months and most common cause of hospitalization in children with primary infection of HHV 6B is febrile seizures which can precipitate status epilepticus due to the sudden rise in body temperature
The reaction to a sting is of three types The normal reaction involves the area around the bite with redness itchiness and pain A large local reaction occurs when the area of swelling is greater than 5 centimetres 2 in Systemic reactions are when symptoms occur in areas besides that of the bites With insect stings a large local reaction may occur an area of skin redness greater than 10 centimetres 4 in in size It can last one to two days It occurs in about 10 of those bitten
Those with Down syndrome nearly always have physical and intellectual disabilities As adults their mental abilities are typically similar to those of an 8 or 9 year old They also typically have poor immune function and generally reach developmental milestones at a later age They have an increased risk of a number of other health problems including congenital heart defect epilepsy leukemia thyroid diseases and mental disorders
The following symptoms are common with any type of dislocation Intense pain Joint instability Deformity of the joint area Reduced muscle strength Bruising or redness of joint area Difficulty moving joint Stiffness
Jaundice Gilbert syndrome produces an elevated level of unconjugated bilirubin in the bloodstream but normally has no consequences Mild jaundice may appear under conditions of exertion stress fasting and infections but the condition is otherwise usually asymptomatic Severe cases are seen by yellowing of the skin tone and yellowing of the conjunctiva in the eye Gilbert syndrome has been reported to contribute to an accelerated onset of neonatal jaundice The syndrome cannot cause severe indirect hyperbilirubinemia in neonates by itself but it may have a summative effect on rising bilirubin when combined with other factors for example in the presence of increased red blood cell destruction due to diseases such as G6PD deficiency This situation can be especially dangerous if not quickly treated as the high bilirubin causes irreversible neurological disability in the form of kernicterus
Hip dysplasia can range from barely detectable to severely malformed or dislocated The congenital form teratologic or non reducible dislocation occurs as part of more complex conditions The condition can be bilateral or unilateral
Signs and symptoms vary depending on the degree of hypothermia and may be divided by the three stages of severity People with hypothermia may appear pale and feel cold to touch Infants with hypothermia may feel cold when touched with bright red skin and an unusual lack of energy Cold stress refers to a near normal body temperature with low skin temperature signs include shivering Cold stress is caused by cold exposure and it can lead to hypothermia and frostbite if not treated Individuals with hypothermia often have impaired judgement impaired sense of time and place unusual aggression and numbness A person with hypothermia can be euphoric and hallucinating
Colic is defined as episodes of crying for more than three hours a day for more than three days a week for at least a three week duration in an otherwise healthy child It is most common around six weeks of age and gets better by six months of age By contrast infants normally cry an average of just over two hours a day with the duration peaking at six weeks With colic periods of crying most commonly happen in the evening and for no obvious reason Associated symptoms may include legs pulled up to the stomach a flushed face clenched hands and a wrinkled brow The cry is often high pitched piercing
Cleft lip If the cleft does not affect the palate structure of the mouth it is referred to as cleft lip Cleft lip is formed in the top of the lip as either a small gap or an indentation in the lip partial or incomplete cleft or it continues into the nose complete cleft Lip cleft can occur as a one sided unilateral or two sided bilateral condition It is due to the failure of fusion of the maxillary prominence and medial nasal processes formation of the primary palate
Cocaine is a powerful stimulant known to make users feel energetic cheerful talkative etc In time negative side effects include increased body temperature irregular or rapid heart rate high blood pressure increased risk of heart attacks strokes and even sudden death from cardiac arrest Many people who habitually use cocaine develop a transient manic like condition similar to amphetamine psychosis and schizophrenia whose symptoms include aggression severe paranoia restlessness confusion and tactile hallucinations which can include the feeling of something crawling under the skin formication also known as coke bugs during binges Different ingestion techniques have their own symptoms that accompany them Snorting it can cause a loss of sense of smell nose bleeds problems swallowing and an inflamed runny nose Smoking it causes lung damage and injecting it puts users at risk of contracting infectious diseases like HIV and hepatitis C Heavy users of cocaine have also reported having thoughts of suicide unusual weight loss trouble maintaining relationships and an unhealthy pale appearance
Initial symptoms can be nonspecific particularly in children Over 50 of children with leukemia had one or more of five features a liver one can feel 64 a spleen one can feel 61 pale complexion 54 fever 53 and bruising 52 Additionally recurrent infections feeling tired arm or leg pain and enlarged lymph nodes can be prominent features The B symptoms such as fever night sweats and weight loss are often present as well Central nervous system CNS symptoms such as cranial neuropathies due to meningeal infiltration are identified in less than 10 of adults and less than 5 of children particularly mature B cell ALL Burkitt leukemia at presentation The signs and symptoms of ALL are variable and include Generalized weakness and feeling tired Anemia Dizziness Headache vomiting lethargy neck stiffness or cranial nerve palsies CNS involvement Frequent or unexplained fever and infection Weight loss and or loss of appetite Excessive and unexplained bruising Bone pain joint pain caused by the spread of blast cells to the surface of the bone or into the joint from the marrow cavity Breathlessness Enlarged lymph nodes liver and or spleen Pitting edema swelling in the lower limbs and or abdomen Petechiae which are tiny red spots or lines in the skin due to low platelet levels Testicular enlargement Mediastinal mass
Skin The most common skin findings associated with bed bugs are pruritic maculopapular erythematous lesions Each lesion is about 2 5 mm but may be as large as 2 cm in diameter and there may or may not be the presence of a central punctum Bites are usually present on areas of exposed skin especially exposed areas not covered by sheets or blankets such as arms legs feet face or neck Individual responses to bites vary ranging from no visible effect in about 20 70 to small flat macular spots to the formation of prominent blisters wheals and bullae along with intense itching that may last several days Vesicles and nodules may also form The lesions due to bites may become secondarily infected due to scratching but systemic effects from bed bug bites are very rare A central spot of bleeding may also occur due to the release of blood thinning substances in the bugs saliva Symptoms may not appear until some days after the bites have occurred Reactions often become brisker after multiple bites due to possible sensitization to the salivary proteins of the bed bug Numerous bites may lead to a red rash or hives
The features of this syndrome vary widely even among members of the same family and affect many parts of the body Characteristic signs and symptoms may include birth defects such as congenital heart disease defects in the palate most commonly related to neuromuscular problems with closure velopharyngeal insufficiency learning disabilities mild differences in facial features and recurrent infections Infections are common in children due to problems with the immune systems T cell mediated response that in some patients is due to an absent or hypoplastic thymus DiGeorge syndrome may be first spotted when an affected newborn has heart defects or convulsions from hypocalcemia due to malfunctioning parathyroid glands and low levels of parathyroid hormone parathormone Affected individuals may also have other kinds of birth defects including kidney abnormalities and significant feeding difficulties as babies Gastrointestinal issues are also very common in this patient population Digestive motility issues may result in constipation Disorders such as hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism or thrombocytopenia low platelet levels and psychiatric illnesses are common late occurring features Microdeletions in chromosomal region 22q11 2 are associated with a 20 to 30 fold increased risk of schizophrenia Studies provide various rates of 22q11 2DS in schizophrenia ranging from 0 5 to 2 0 and averaging about 1 0 compared with the overall estimated 0 025 risk of the 22q11 2DS in the general population Salient features can be summarized using the mnemonic CATCH 22 to describe 22q11 2DS with the 22 signifying the chromosomal abnormality is found on the 22nd chromosome as below Cardiac abnormality commonly interrupted aortic arch truncus arteriosus and tetralogy of Fallot Abnormal facies Thymic aplasia or hypoplasia Cleft palate Hypocalcemia hypoparathyroidism early in lifeIndividuals can have many possible features ranging in number of associated features and from the mild to the very serious Symptoms shown to be common include
The onset of the condition is usually gradual although some cases may appear suddenly following trauma The most common symptom is diffuse vague pain around the kneecap peripatellar and localized pain focused behind the kneecap retropatellar Affected individuals typically have difficulty describing the location of the pain They may place their hands over the anterior patella or describe a circle around the patella This is often called the circle sign Pain is usually initiated when weight is put on the knee extensor mechanism such as when ascending or descending stairs or slopes squatting kneeling cycling or running Pain during prolonged sitting is sometimes termed the movie sign or theatre sign because individuals might experience pain while sitting to watch a film or similar activity The pain is typically aching and occasionally sharp Pain may be exacerbated by activities The knee joint may exhibit noises such as clicking However this has no relation to pain and function Giving way of the knee may be reported Reduced knee flexion may be experienced during activities
Gastrointestinal Many people with Crohns disease have symptoms for years before the diagnosis The usual onset is in the teens and twenties but can occur at any age Because of the patchy nature of the gastrointestinal disease and the depth of tissue involvement initial symptoms can be more subtle than those of ulcerative colitis People with Crohns disease experience chronic recurring periods of flare ups and remission The symptoms experienced can change over time as inflammation increases and spreads Symptoms can also be different depending on which organs are involved It is generally thought that the presentation of Crohns disease is different for each patient due to the high variability of symptoms organ involvement and initial presentation
The most common symptom of IIH is headache which occurs in almost all 92 94 cases It is characteristically worse in the morning generalized in character and throbbing in nature It may be associated with nausea and vomiting The headache can be made worse by any activity that further increases the intracranial pressure such as coughing and sneezing The pain may also be experienced in the neck and shoulders Many have pulsatile tinnitus a whooshing sensation in one or both ears 64 87 this sound is synchronous with the pulse Various other symptoms such as numbness of the extremities generalized weakness loss of smell and loss of coordination are reported more rarely none are specific for IIH In children numerous nonspecific signs and symptoms may be present The increased pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves a group of nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck Most commonly the abducens nerve sixth nerve is involved This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side More rarely the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve third and fourth nerve palsy respectively are affected both play a role in eye movements The facial nerve seventh cranial nerve is affected occasionally the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face The increased pressure leads to papilledema which is swelling of the optic disc the spot where the optic nerve enters the eyeball This occurs in practically all cases of IIH but not everyone experiences symptoms from this Those who do experience symptoms typically report transient visual obscurations episodes of difficulty seeing that occur in both eyes but not necessarily at the same time Long term untreated papilledema leads to visual loss initially in the periphery but progressively towards the center of vision Physical examination of the nervous system is typically normal apart from the presence of papilledema which is seen on examination of the eye with a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a fundus camera If there are cranial nerve abnormalities these may be noticed on eye examination in the form of a squint third fourth or sixth nerve palsy or as facial nerve palsy If the papilledema has been longstanding visual fields may be constricted and visual acuity may be decreased Visual field testing by automated Humphrey perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate Longstanding papilledema leads to optic atrophy in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced
Symptoms include aural fullness ears popping a feeling of pressure in the affected ear s a feeling that the affected ear s is clogged crackling ear pain tinnitus autophony and muffled hearing
Ménières is characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo fluctuating hearing loss and tinnitus episodes may be preceded by a headache and a feeling of fullness in the ears People may also experience additional symptoms related to irregular reactions of the autonomic nervous system These symptoms are not symptoms of Menieres disease per se but rather are side effects resulting from failure of the organ of hearing and balance and include nausea vomiting and sweating which are typically symptoms of vertigo and not of Ménières This includes a sensation of being pushed sharply to the floor from behind Sudden falls without loss of consciousness drop attacks may be experienced by some people
Typically Hirschsprung disease is diagnosed shortly after birth although it may develop well into adulthood because of the presence of megacolon or because the baby fails to pass the first stool meconium within 48 hours of delivery Normally 90 of babies pass their first meconium within 24 hours and 99 within 48 hours Other symptoms include symptoms of bowel perforation such as vomiting constipation poor feeding lethargy and diarrhea Symptoms of bowel obstruction would include vomiting of bile and abdominal distension Those who pass stools after 36 to 48 hours after birth should raise suspicion of Hirschsprung disease Such suspicion can also be risen if there is only passage of stools after suppository rectal exam or enema Children who do not respond to constipation treatment for six months should also raise suspicion of such disease Enterocolitis an acute complication of Hirschsprung disease is characterised by sudden onset of fever abdominal distension vomiting passage of bloody stools or release of explosive gas or stools after rectal examination Some cases are diagnosed later into childhood but usually before age 10 The child may experience fecal retention constipation or abdominal distention
This typically results in chest pain that is worse with inspiration Bruising may occur at the site of the break
There is a recurrent acute and chronic inflammation and thrombosis of arteries and veins of the hands and feet The main symptom is pain in the affected areas at rest and while walking claudication The impaired circulation increases sensitivity to cold Peripheral pulses are diminished or absent There are color changes in the extremities The colour may range from cyanotic blue to reddish blue Skin becomes thin and shiny Hair growth is reduced Ulcerations and gangrene in the extremities are common complications often resulting in the need for amputation of the involved extremity
Dyshidrosis has been described as having the following characteristics
Testicular torsion usually presents with severe testicular pain or pain in the groin and lower abdomen Pain generally begins suddenly and typically involves only one side There is often associated nausea and vomiting The testicle may lie higher in the scrotum due to twisting and subsequent shortening of the spermatic cord or may be positioned in a horizontal orientation Mild warmth and redness of the overlying area may be present Elevation of the testicle may worsen the pain Urinary symptoms such as pain or increased frequency of urination are also typically absent Symptom onset often follows physical activity or trauma to the testes or scrotum Children with testicular torsion may awaken with testicular or abdominal pain in the middle of the night or in the morning There may be a history of previous similar episodes of scrotal pain due to prior transient testicular torsion with spontaneous resolution
Symptoms in PID range from none to severe If there are symptoms fever cervical motion tenderness lower abdominal pain new or different discharge painful intercourse uterine tenderness adnexal tenderness or irregular menstruation may be noted Other complications include endometritis salpingitis tubo ovarian abscess pelvic peritonitis periappendicitis and perihepatitis
PND may present itself through the constant presence of discomfort in the upper airways It is classically described as the sensation of a substance dripping down the throat and may also present with rhinorrhea constant throat clearing and cough although its symptoms can be very nonspecific PND is one of the most common etiologies for chronic cough defined as a cough persisting beyond 8 weeks GERD is often associated with a high prevalence of upper respiratory symptoms similar to those of PND such as coughing throat clearing hoarseness and change in voice Reflux causes throat irritation leading to a sensation of increased mucus in the throat which is believed to aggravate and in some cases cause post nasal drip Post nasal drip can be a cause of laryngeal inflammation and hyperresponsiveness leading to symptoms of vocal cord dysfunction
Many rotator cuff tears have no symptoms Both partial and full thickness tears have been found on post mortem and MRI studies in those without any history of shoulder pain or symptoms However the most common presentation is shoulder pain or discomfort This may occur with activity particularly shoulder activity above the horizontal position but may also be present at rest in bed Pain restricted movement above the horizontal position may be present as well as weakness with shoulder flexion and abduction Abnormal mobility or function of the scapula scapular dyskinesia may be present and is related to lower functional scores it unclear whether scapular dyskinesia is a cause effect or compensation for rotator cuff pathology
Symptoms of aortic regurgitation are similar to those of heart failure and include the following Dyspnea on exertion Orthopnea Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea Palpitations Angina pectoris Cyanosis in acute cases
On average exposures at 100 ppm or greater is dangerous to human health In the United States the OSHA limits long term workplace exposure levels to less than 50 ppm averaged over an 8 hour period in addition employees are to be removed from any confined space if an upper limit ceiling of 100 ppm is reached
The classic presentation of COP is the development of nonspecific systemic e g fevers chills night sweats fatigue weight loss and respiratory e g difficulty breathing cough symptoms in association with filling of the lung alveoli that is visible on chest x ray This presentation is usually so suggestive of an infection that the majority of patients with COP have been treated with at least one failed course of antibiotics by the time the true diagnosis is made Symptoms are usually subacute occurring over weeks to months with dry cough seen in 71 of people dyspnea shortness of breath 62 and fever 44 being the most common symptoms
The presentation of individuals with alpha thalassemia consists of
The disease is characterised by the formation of painful abscesses in the mouth lungs breast or gastrointestinal tract Actinomycosis abscesses grow larger as the disease progresses often over months In severe cases they may penetrate the surrounding bone and muscle to the skin where they break open and leak large amounts of pus which often contains characteristic granules filled with progeny bacteria These granules are often called sulfur granules due to their yellow appearance although they may also be white gray or brown
Fever headache and neurological problems while classic only occur in 20 of people with brain abscess The famous triad of fever headache and focal neurologic findings are highly suggestive of brain abscess These symptoms are caused by a combination of increased intracranial pressure due to a space occupying lesion headache vomiting confusion coma infection fever fatigue etc and focal neurologic brain tissue damage hemiparesis aphasia etc The most frequent presenting symptoms are headache drowsiness confusion seizures hemiparesis or speech difficulties together with fever with a rapidly progressive course Headache is characteristically worse at night and in the morning as the intracranial pressure naturally increases when in the supine position This elevation similarly stimulates the medullary vomiting center and area postrema leading to morning vomiting Other symptoms and findings depend largely on the specific location of the abscess in the brain An abscess in the cerebellum for instance may cause additional complaints as a result of brain stem compression and hydrocephalus Neurological examination may reveal a stiff neck in occasional cases erroneously suggesting meningitis
Signs and symptoms of CVI in the leg include the following
One of the first signs of testicular cancer is often a lump or swelling in the testes The U S Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF recommends against routine screening for testicular cancer in asymptomatic adolescent and adults including routine testicular self exams However the American Cancer Society suggests that some men should examine their testicles monthly especially if they have a family history of cancer and the American Urological Association recommends monthly testicular self examinations for all young men Symptoms may also include one or more of the following
In humans after an incubation period of 5 19 days the symptoms of the disease range from inapparent illness to systemic illness with severe pneumonia It presents chiefly as an atypical pneumonia In the first week of psittacosis the symptoms mimic typhoid fever prostrating high fevers joint pains diarrhea conjunctivitis nose bleeds and low level of white blood cells Rose spots called Horders spots can appear Spleen enlargement is common towards the end of the first week It may become a serious lung infection Diagnosis can be suspected in case of respiratory infection associated with splenomegaly and or epistaxis Headache can be so severe that it suggests meningitis and some nuchal rigidity is not unusual Towards the end of the first week stupor or even coma can result in severe cases The second week is more akin to acute bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia with continuous high fevers headaches cough and dyspnea X rays show patchy infiltrates or a diffuse whiteout of lung fields Complications in the form of endocarditis liver inflammation inflammation of the hearts muscle joint inflammation keratoconjunctivitis occasionally extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the lacrimal gland orbit and neurologic complications brain inflammation may occasionally occur Severe pneumonia requiring intensive care support may also occur Fatal cases have been reported less than 1 of cases
Burns Heating due to resistance can cause extensive and deep burns When applied to the hand electricity can cause involuntary muscle contraction producing the no let go phenomenon and increasing the risk for serious burns Voltage levels of 500 to 1000 volts tend to cause internal burns due to the large energy which is proportional to the duration multiplied by the square of the voltage divided by resistance available from the source Damage due to current is through tissue heating and or electroporation injury For most cases of high energy electrical trauma the Joule heating in the deeper tissues along the extremity will reach damaging temperatures in a few seconds
Signs and symptoms of foreign body aspiration vary based on the site of obstruction the size of the foreign body and the severity of obstruction 20 of foreign bodies become lodged in the upper airway while 80 become lodged in a bronchus Signs of foreign body aspiration are usually abrupt in onset and can involve coughing choking and or wheezing however symptoms can be slower in onset if the foreign body does not cause a large degree of obstruction of the airway With this said aspiration can also be asymptomatic on rare occasions Classically patients present with acute onset of choking In these cases the obstruction is classified as a partial or complete obstruction Signs of partial obstruction include choking with drooling stridor and the patient maintains the ability to speak Signs of complete obstruction include choking with inability to speak or absence of bilateral breath sounds among other signs of respiratory distress such as cyanosis A fever may be present When this is the case it is possible the object may be chemically irritating or contaminated Foreign bodies above the larynx often present with stridor while objects below the larynx present with wheezing Foreign bodies above the vocal cords often present with difficulty and pain with swallowing and excessive drooling Foreign bodies below the vocal cords often present with pain and difficulty with speaking and breathing Increased respiratory rate may be the only sign of foreign body aspiration in a child who cannot verbalize or report if they have swallowed a foreign body If the foreign body does not cause a large degree of obstruction patients may present with chronic cough asymmetrical breath sounds on exam or recurrent pneumonia of a specific lung lobe If the aspiration occurred weeks or even months ago the object may lead to an obstructive pneumonia or even a lung abscess Therefore it is important to consider chronic foreign body aspiration in patients whose histories include unexplained recurrent pneumonia or lung abscess with or without fever In adults the right lower lobe of the lung is the most common site of recurrent pneumonia in foreign body aspiration This is due to the fact that the anatomy of the right main bronchus is wider and steeper than that of the left main bronchus allowing objects to enter more easily than the left side Unlike adults there is only a slight propensity towards objects lodging in the right bronchus in children This is likely due to the bilateral bronchial angles being symmetric until about 15 years of age when the aortic knob fully develops and displaces the left main bronchus Signs and symptoms of foreign body aspiration in adults may also mimic other lung disorders such as asthma COPD and lung cancer
CCA is characterized by contractures of varying degrees mainly involving the large joints which are present in all affected children at birth The contractures may be mild and tend to improve over time but permanently bent fingers and toes camptodactyly are almost always present In addition to long fingers and toes and a tall slender body people with CCA often have ears that appear to be crumpled joint stiffness and underdeveloped muscles muscular hypoplasia and they may have curved spines congenital kyphoscoliosis If kyphoscoliosis is present it often becomes progressively worse and may require surgery In some cases the blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body aorta may be abnormally enlarged aortic root dilatation
The affected infant tends to be short with a disproportionately large head The fetal head of infants born with iniencephaly are hyperextended while the foramen magnum is enlarged and opens through the widened pedicles The defective neural arches directly into the upper cervical reach of the spinal canal causing the formation of a common cavity between most of the spinal cord and the brain The skin of the anterior chest is connected directly to the face bypassing the formation of a neck while the scalp is directly connected to the skin of the back Because of this those born with this anomaly either have a highly shortened neck or no neck at all This causes extreme retroflexion or backward bending of the head in a star gazing fashion The spine is severely distorted as well along with significant shortening due to marked lordosis The vertebrae especially cervical are fused together in abnormal shapes and their numbers are reduced The spinal cord is almost always defective while the ventricular system is often dilated and the cortex is thinned Sometimes in the case of iniencephaly apertus an encephalocele sac like protrusions of the brain through an opening in the cranium forms
Typically patients with vocal fold paresis or paralysis are able to identify the onset of their symptoms The most commonly reported symptom patients with either vocal fold paresis or paralysis make is having a rough voice quality It is important to note that the symptoms of vocal fold paresis are not specific to the condition and tend to be common symptoms of other voice disorders as well Vocal fold bowing decreased vocal fold mobility especially decreased mobility of the arytenoid cartilage are often observed in vocal fold paresis Glottal insufficiency is another common symptom observed in vocal fold paresis In this case the vocal folds do not come together properly Glottal insufficiency may be hard to identify especially when the area above the vocal folds is hyperfunctional Hyperfunction may also make it difficult to detect the presence of vocal fold paresis Hyperfunction of the area above the vocal folds may be considered a sign of glottal insufficiency and potentially vocal fold paresis In some cases glottal closure may appear to be normal however asymmetries in the vocal folds may still be present Though voice qualities may appear normal in some cases of vocal fold paresis or paralysis mild differences in tension between the two vocal folds of the larynx can result in changes of voice pitch intensity and reduced vocal stamina Patients with either vocal fold paresis or paralysis may exhibit a breathy voice quality This voice quality results from the increased activity of the vocal folds to compensate for the immobility of the PCA muscle s Patients may need to use more effort than normal when speaking and may find that their voice quiets or grows tired after speaking for a long time This is known as vocal fatigue Patients may also complain about having a limited pitch range and trouble varying their pitch at quick rate It is often difficult for the speaker to project their voice and speak loud enough to be heard in noisy environments over background noise or when speaking to someone from a distance It is possible for symptoms to surface only in situations where the environmental acoustics are poor such as outdoors Patients may report feeling pain in the throat or experiencing bouts of choking A patient presenting with diplophonia is of major concern as this typically means that the mass and tension of their vocal folds are asymmetrical which may also indicate vocal fold paresis Swallowing difficulties dysphagia are not commonly seen in vocal fold paresis that results from RLN damage Dysphagia may however suggest SLN damage Symptoms of sensory nerve damage include chronic coughing the feeling of having a lump in the throat globus sensation hypersensitivity or abnormal sensation spasms of the vocal folds laryngospasms dysphagia pain from vocal use and voice loss in high pitch ranges It is possible for both the RLN and the SLN to be damaged simultaneously so the symptoms of RLN and SLN damage may be seen independently or alongside one another If maladaptive compensatory strategies are used more and more to try to offset the voice difficulties the vocal mechanisms will fatigue and the above symptoms will worsen
Some examples of symptoms experienced by patients with RSI are aching pulsing pain tingling and extremity weakness initially presenting with intermittent discomfort and then with a higher degree of frequency
Symptoms of CTE which occur in four stages generally appear eight to ten years after an individual experiences repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries First stage symptoms are confusion disorientation dizziness and headaches Second stage symptoms include memory loss social instability impulsive behavior and poor judgment Third and fourth stages include progressive dementia movement disorders hypomimia speech impediments sensory processing disorder tremors vertigo deafness depression and suicidality Additional symptoms include dysarthria dysphagia cognitive disorders such as amnesia and ocular abnormalities such as ptosis The condition manifests as dementia or declining mental ability problems with memory dizzy spells or lack of balance to the point of not being able to walk under ones own power for a short time and or Parkinsonism or tremors and lack of coordination It can also cause speech problems and an unsteady gait Patients with CTE may be prone to inappropriate or explosive behavior and may display pathological jealousy or paranoia
Infertility Many men who were born with undescended testes have reduced fertility even after orchiopexy in infancy The reduction with unilateral cryptorchidism is subtle with a reported infertility rate of about 10 compared with about 6 reported by the same study for the general population of adult men The fertility reduction after orchiopexy for bilateral cryptorchidism is more marked about 38 or six times that of the general population The basis for the universal recommendation for early surgery is research showing degeneration of spermatogenic tissue and reduced spermatogonia counts after the second year of life in undescended testes The degree to which this is prevented or improved by early orchiopexy is still uncertain
If unruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm commonly abbreviated SVA or SOVA is usually asymptomatic and typically goes undetected until symptoms appear or medical imaging is performed for other reasons If symptoms do occur the most common are shortness of breath palpitations myocardial ischemia and syncope Even less common but more serious presentations are embolic stroke and myocardial infarction due to blockage of a coronary artery by the aneurysm A ruptured aneurysm typically leads to an aortocardiac shunt and progressively worsening heart failure An aneurysm of the aortic sinus may rupture due to infective endocarditis involving the aortic wall and tertiary stage syphilis The manifestations appear depending on the site where the sinus has ruptured For example if the sinus ruptures in a low pressure area like the right atrium or right ventricle then a continuous type of murmur is heard The murmur is located in the left parasternal region mainly confined to the lower sternum It is also accompanied by a superficial thrill A ruptured Sinus of Valsalva abscess represents a surgical emergency
Syringomyelia causes a wide variety of neuropathic symptoms due to damage to the spinal cord Patients may experience severe chronic pain abnormal sensations and loss of sensation particularly in the hands Some patients experience paralysis or paresis temporarily or permanently A syrinx may also cause disruptions in the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems leading to abnormal body temperature or sweating bowel control issues or other problems If the syrinx is higher up in the spinal cord or affecting the brainstem as in syringobulbia vocal cord paralysis ipsilateral tongue wasting trigeminal nerve sensory loss and other signs may be present Rarely bladder stones can occur at the onset of weakness in the lower extremities Classically syringomyelia spares the dorsal column medial lemniscus of the spinal cord leaving pressure vibration touch and proprioception intact in the upper extremities Neuropathic arthropathy also known as a Charcot joint can occur particularly in the shoulders in patients with syringomyelia The loss of sensory fibers to the joint is theorized to lead to degeneration of the joint over time
The clinical symptoms of bartonellosis are pleomorphic and some patients from endemic areas may be asymptomatic The two classical clinical presentations are the acute phase and the chronic phase corresponding to the two different host cell types invaded by the bacterium red blood cells and endothelial cells An individual can be affected by either or both phases
Among the signs symptoms of polyneuropathy which can be divided into sensory and hereditary and are consistent with the following Sensory polyneuropathy ataxia numbness muscle wasting and paraesthesiae Hereditary polyneuropathy scoliosis and hammer toes
Phantom pain involves the sensation of pain in a part of the body that has been removed The onset of phantom pain can occur within the first few days of amputation The sensation may come and go but can be continuous While the sensation often affects the part of the limb farthest from the body such as the foot of an amputated leg other body parts closer to the brain such as the arm or hand can still experience similar sensations Sensations can be described as shooting stabbing boring squeezing throbbing or burning Sensations on smaller limbs and digits such as toes or fingers tend to be less severe Sometimes the sensation feels as if the phantom part is forced into an uncomfortable position Overall the sensations may be triggered by pressure on the remaining part of the limb or emotional stress
The classic symptoms of untreated coeliac disease include pale loose or greasy stools steatorrhoea and weight loss or failure to gain weight Other common symptoms may be subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any of the classic symptoms at all This has been shown to comprise at least 43 of presentations in children Further many adults with subtle disease may only present with fatigue anaemia or low bone mass Many undiagnosed individuals who consider themselves asymptomatic are in fact not but rather have become accustomed to living in a state of chronically compromised health Indeed after starting a gluten free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease that they had mistakenly ignored
Characteristics include a blue black stain of skin initially Skin is thin about 4 5 cell layers thick which is often related to aging Histological features include epidermal atrophy and increased number of melanocytes
Stomatocytosis may present with signs and symptoms consistent with hemolytic anemia as a result of extravascular hemolysis and often intravascular hemolysis These include fatigue and pallor as well as signs of jaundice splenomegaly and gallstone formation from prolonged hemolysis Certain cases of hereditary stomatocytosis associated with genetic syndromes have additional symptoms that are unrelated to the hemolytic anemia
Early symptoms of HACE generally correspond with those of moderate to severe acute mountain sickness AMS Initial symptoms of HACE commonly include confusion loss of consciousness fever ataxia photophobia rapid heart beat lassitude and an altered mental state Those affected generally attempt to cease physical activities regardless of their necessity for survival Severe headaches develop and people lose the ability to sit up Retinal venous dilation occurs in 59 of people with HACE Rarer symptoms include brisk deep tendon reflexes retinal hemorrhages blurred vision extension plantar reflexes and ocular paralysis Cranial nerve palsies occur in some unusual cases In the bestselling 1996 non fiction book Into Thin Air A Personal Account of the Mt Everest Disaster Jon Krakauer describes the effects of HACE upon Dale Kruse a forty four year old dentist and one of the members of Scott Fischers team Kruse was having an incredibly difficult time simply trying to dress himself He put his climbing harness on inside out threaded it through the fly of his wind suit and failed to fasten the buckle fortunately Fischer and Neal Beidleman noticed the screwup before Kruse started to descend If hed tried to rappel down the ropes like that says Beidleman he would have immediately popped out of his harness and fallen to the bottom of the Lhotse Face It was like I was very drunk Kruse recollects I couldnt walk without stumbling and completely lost the ability to think or speak It was a really strange feeling Id have some word in my mind but I couldnt figure out how to bring it to my lips So Scott and Neal had to get me dressed and make sure my harness was on correctly then Scott lowered me down the fixed ropes By the time Kruse arrived in Base Camp he says it was still another three or four days before I could walk from my tent to the mess tent without stumbling all over the place Patients with HACE have an elevated white blood cell count but otherwise their blood count and biochemistry are normal If a lumbar puncture is performed it will show normal cerebral spinal fluid and cell counts but an increase in pressure In one study CT scans of patients with HACE exhibited ventricle compression and low density in the cerebellum Only a few autopsies have been performed on fatal cases of HACE they showed swollen gyri spongiosis of white matter and compressed sulci There was some variation between individuals and the results may not be typical of HACE deaths
Desquamative gingivitis involves lesions of the free and attached gingiva Unlike plaque induced inflammation of the gums normal marginal gingivitis desquamative gingivitis extends beyond the marginal gingiva involving the full width of the gingiva and sometimes the alveolar mucosa The term full width gingivitis usually refers to the oral lesions of orofacial granulomatosis however The color is another dissimilarity between typical marginal gingivitis and desquamative gingivitis in the latter it is dusky red Plasma cell gingivitis is another form of gingivitis which affects both the attached and free gingiva
Chief markers of Goldenhar syndrome are incomplete development of the ear nose soft palate lip and mandible on usually one side of the body Additionally some patients will have growing issues with internal organs especially heart kidneys and lungs Typically the organ will either not be present on one side or will be underdeveloped While it is more usual for there to be problems on only one side it has been known for defects to occur bilaterally approximate incidence 10 of confirmed GS cases Other problems can include severe scoliosis twisting of the vertebrae limbal dermoids and hearing loss see hearing loss with craniofacial syndromes and deafness or blindness in one or both ears eyes Granulosa cell tumors may be associated as well
People with this condition exhibit symptoms susch as progressive muscle weakness affecting the eyes face and pharynx which consequently results in blepharoptosis ophthalmoparesis atrophy of the facial muscles dysphagia dysarthria and muscle weakness and atrophy of the upper and lower distal limbs These symptoms usually start during adulthood On rare cases hearing loss severe proximal weakness and or unilateral muscle weakness
The initial symptoms in two thirds of cases are loss of balance lunging forward when mobilizing fast walking bumping into objects or people and falls Dementia symptoms are also initially seen in about one in five cases of frontotemporal dementia Other common early symptoms are changes in personality general slowing of movement and visual symptoms The most common behavioural symptoms in patients with PSP include apathy disinhibition anxiety and dysphoria Later symptoms and signs can include but do not necessarily include dementia typically including loss of inhibition and ability to organize information slurring of speech difficulty swallowing and difficulty moving the eyes particularly in the vertical direction The latter accounts for some of the falls experienced by these patients as they find it difficult to look up or down Some of the other signs are poor eyelid function contracture of the facial muscles a backward tilt of the head with stiffening of the neck muscles sleep disruption urinary incontinence and constipation Some patients retain full cognitive function up to the end The visual symptoms are of particular importance in the diagnosis of this disorder Patients typically complain of difficulty reading due to the inability to look down well The ophthalmoparesis experienced by these patients mainly concerns voluntary eye movement and the inability to make vertical saccades which is often worse with downward saccades Patients tend to have difficulty looking down a downgaze palsy followed by the addition of an upgaze palsy This vertical gaze paresis will correct when the examiner passively rolls the patients head up and down as part of a test for the oculocephalic reflex Involuntary eye movement as elicited by Bells phenomenon for instance may be closer to normal On close inspection eye movements called square wave jerks may be visible when the patient fixes at distance These are fine movements that can be mistaken for nystagmus except that they are saccadic in nature with no smooth phase Although healthy individuals also make square wave jerk movements PSP patients make slower square wave jerk movements with smaller vertical components Assessment of these square wave jerks and diminished vertical saccades is especially useful for diagnosing progressive supranuclear palsy because these movements set PSP patients apart from other parkinsonian patients Difficulties with convergence convergence insufficiency where the eyes come closer together while focusing on something near like the pages of a book is typical Because the eyes have trouble coming together to focus at short distances the patient may complain of diplopia double vision when reading A characteristic facial appearance known as procerus sign with a wide eye stare furrowing of forehead with a frowning expression and deepening of other facial creases is diagnostic of PSP
Some indicators of monilethrix are small bumps on the skin mainly on the scalp neck and arms In most cases firm dark papules covered with dark scales and crusts appears on the skin especially the scalp The affected individual would have beaded hair strands The possible areas for the hair loss are the eyebrows eyelashes limbs and pubic region Hair strands are usually dull dry and brittle The strands are prone to mild to severe breakage causing onset alopecia especially during pregnancy Fingernail and toenails tend to appear abnormal The onset for this disease varies from person to person The frequency of monilethrix is currently unknown
Cognitive problems Intellectual disability Delay in cognitive development Extreme mood swings Language delay
Striae or stretch marks begin as reddish or purple lesions which can appear anywhere on the body but are most likely to appear in places where larger amounts of fat are stored the most common places are the abdomen especially near the navel breasts upper arms underarms back thighs both inner and outer hips and buttocks Over time they tend to atrophy and lose pigmentation The affected areas appear empty and are soft to the touch Stretch marks occur in the dermis the resilient middle tissue layer that helps the skin retain its shape No stretch marks will form as long as there is support within the dermis stretching plays a role in where the marks occur and in what direction they run however there are a number of contributing factors see Causes below to their formation They can but do not always cause a burning and itching sensation as well as emotional distress They pose no health risk in and of themselves and do not compromise the bodys ability to function normally and repair itself however they are often considered a cosmetic nuisance Young women are generally affected the most and often seek treatment for them from a dermatologist and following pregnancy
This condition exists in a variety of forms ranging from partial absence of the tail bone regions of the spine to absence of the lower vertebrae pelvis and parts of the thoracic and or lumbar areas of the spine In some cases where only a small part of the spine is absent there may be no outward sign of the condition In cases where more substantial areas of the spine are absent there may be fused webbed or smaller lower extremities and paralysis Bowel and bladder control is usually affected
In spite of Crohns and UC being very different diseases both may present with any of the following symptoms abdominal pain diarrhea rectal bleeding severe internal cramps muscle spasms in the region of the pelvis and weight loss Anemia is the most prevalent extraintestinal complication of inflammatory bowel disease Associated complaints or diseases include arthritis pyoderma gangrenosum primary sclerosing cholangitis and non thyroidal illness syndrome NTIS Associations with deep vein thrombosis DVT and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia BOOP have also been reported Diagnosis is generally by assessment of inflammatory markers in stool followed by colonoscopy with biopsy of pathological lesions
Signs and symptoms include anxiety rapid breathing restlessness shock and pale cool clammy skin When the affected area is percussed a dull feeling may be observed Neck veins may be flat and breathing sounds reduced It can also cause a collapsed lung atelectasis Massive hemothorax often defined as over 1 5 liters of blood initially when an intercostal drain is placed or a bleeding rate greater than 2 liters hr can result in shock with two causes massive bleeding resulting from hypovolemic shock and venous pressure from the retained blood impairing blood flow
Episodes of vasovagal syncope are typically recurrent and usually occur when the predisposed person is exposed to a specific trigger Before losing consciousness the individual frequently experiences early signs or symptoms such as lightheadedness nausea the feeling of being extremely hot or cold accompanied by sweating ringing in the ears an uncomfortable feeling in the heart fuzzy thoughts confusion a slight inability to speak or form words sometimes combined with mild stuttering weakness and visual disturbances such as lights seeming too bright fuzzy or tunnel vision black cloud like spots in vision and a feeling of nervousness can occur as well The symptoms may become more intense over several seconds to several minutes before the loss of consciousness if it is lost Onset usually occurs when a person is sitting up or standing When people lose consciousness they fall down unless prevented from doing so and when in this position effective blood flow to the brain is immediately restored allowing the person to regain consciousness If the person does not fall into a fully flat supine position and the head remains elevated above the trunk a state similar to a seizure may result from the bloods inability to return quickly to the brain and the neurons in the body will fire off and generally cause muscles to twitch very slightly but mostly remain very tense The autonomic nervous systems physiological state see below leading to loss of consciousness may persist for several minutes so
Age of onset is variable The term juvenile in the title of juvenile polyposis syndrome refers to the histological type of the polyps rather than the age of onset Affected individuals may present with rectal bleeding abdominal pain diarrhea or anemia On colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy polyps that vary in shape or size are present The polyps can be sessile or pedunculated hamartomatous polyps
PPNAD is a rare cause of high cortisol levels in the blood and often manifests as ACTH independent Cushings syndrome The effects of PPNAD can often be cyclical so the symptoms of Cushings syndrome will not always be as severe which may complicate diagnosis The classic symptoms of Cushings syndrome include rapid central weight gain a puffy red face and a buffalo hump at the back of the neck due to fat deposits Skin changes in Cushings syndrome include thinning and bruising easily developing striae and hyperpigmentation at skin folds The hormonal changes can lead to hirsutism males developing breast tissue females no longer having periods and both sexes may become infertile High cortisol levels can lead to psychological disturbances such as anxiety or depression and insomnia Bone health can deteriorate leading to an increased fracture risk in people with Cushings syndrome PPNAD is unique as it often causes Cushings at a young age in children and adolescents In addition to the other symptoms of Cushings syndrome the patient may have a short stature due to interrupted growth because of ACTH suppression In 90 of people with PPNAD it is associated with Carney Complex Carney Complex is usually inherited however it can also occur sporadically A visible sign of Carney complex is abnormal skin hyperpigmentation There may also be myxomas which can appear as lumps in the skin and breast as well as often being present in the heart which can lead to multiple cardiovascular problems The majority of people with PPNAD will have some of these signs symptoms due to the strong association between PPNAD and Carney Complex
Most of the symptoms of BLS are non specific but nevertheless warrant the utmost attention These include Loss of appetite Nausea Flatulence Diarrhea Fullness after a meal Fatty stools steatorrhea Unintentional weight loss Generalised weaknessAs a result of the concomitant vitamin and mineral deficiencies that occur as a result of the malabsorption associated with BLS patients with advanced cases should be investigated for Vitamin B12 deficiency Folate deficiency Iron deficiency Vitamin E deficiency
Beaus lines are horizontal going across the nailline and should not be confused with vertical ridges going from the bottom cuticle of the nail out to the fingertip These vertical lines are usually a natural consequence of aging and are harmless Beaus lines should also be distinguished from Muehrckes lines of the fingernails While Beaus lines are actual ridges and indentations in the nail plate Muehrcke lines are areas of hypopigmentation without palpable ridges they affect the underlying nail bed and not the nail itself Beaus lines should also be distinguished from Mees lines of the fingernails which are areas of discoloration in the nail plate As the nail grows out the ridge in the nail can be seen to move upwards until it reaches the fingertip When it reaches this point the fingertips can become sore for a few days due to the nail bed being exposed by the mis shapen nail
It is characterized by early onset myoclonic seizures that can vary from erratic movements of a single limb or a part of the face focal to bilateral myoclonic movement of the whole body The myoclonus may occur at any time sleep wakefulneess from few times per day to very frequent or even continuous myoclonus The symptoms may start appearing as early as a few hours after birth and up to three months of age Around three fourths of affected children present with neonatal seizure Other seizure types such as focal or generalized tonic seizures epileptic spasms or other epileptic manifestations may occur at the course of the disease The distinctive feature of the phenotype is severe progressive encephalopathy with delay in development and abnormal neurological examination delay hypotonia lethargy poor eye contact difficulties in feeding usually being present even before the onset of other symptoms Head circumference is usually normal at onset but microcephaly may develop over time Family history is usually normal
People with AD often have dry and scaly skin that spans the entire body except perhaps the diaper area and intensely itchy red splotchy raised lesions to form in the bends of the arms or legs face and neck AD commonly affects the eyelids where signs such as Dennie Morgan infraorbital fold infra auricular fissure and periorbital pigmentation can be seen Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation on the neck gives the classic dirty neck appearance Lichenification excoriation and erosion or crusting on the trunk may indicate secondary infection Flexural distribution with ill defined edges with or without hyperlinearity on the wrist finger knuckles ankle feet and hands are also commonly seen
Physical signs of a peritonsillar abscess include redness and swelling in the tonsillar area of the affected side and swelling of the jugulodigastric lymph nodes The uvula may be displaced towards the unaffected side Unlike tonsillitis which is more common in children PTA has a more even age spread from children to adults Symptoms start appearing two to eight days before the formation of an abscess A progressively severe sore throat on one side and pain during swallowing odynophagia usually are the earliest symptoms As the abscess develops persistent pain in the peritonsillar area fever a general sense of feeling unwell headache and a distortion of vowels informally known as hot potato voice may appear Neck pain associated with tender swollen lymph nodes referred ear pain and foul breath are also common While these signs may be present in tonsillitis itself a PTA should be specifically considered if there is limited ability to open the mouth trismus
Tooth affected by this condition has a higher risk of developing caries and periradicular pathology The thin layer of the infolding enamel could be chipped off easily providing entrance for microorganisms into the tooth canal This can cause abscess formation displacement of dental structures i e teeth Preventive measures should be taken
Encephaloceles are often accompanied by craniofacial abnormalities or other brain malformations Symptoms may include neurologic problems hydrocephalus cerebrospinal fluid accumulated in the brain spastic quadriplegia paralysis of the limbs microcephaly an abnormally small head ataxia uncoordinated muscle movement developmental delay vision problems mental and growth retardation and seizures
These lesions are generally asymptomatic although patients give a long history of a solitary superficial mass The mass is usually in the neck hence the name nuchal type but it can be seen in the extremities lumbosacral area buttocks and face There is a strong association with diabetes mellitus and Gardner syndrome in fact it may be the initial manifestation of Gardner syndrome
Fiddlers neck usually involves highly localized lichenification mild hyperpigmentation and erythema where the chin rest or instrument body presses against the skin of the neck Other signs and symptoms include scale buildup cyst and scar formation papules and pustules related to local infection and focal edema In Blum Ritters study in West Germany 1990 they found that 27 of their population had only minor issues 72 had a palpable mass at the site and 23 reported pain and other signs of inflammation such as hyperthermia pulsation and cystic pustular or papular lesions Size of masses were an average of 2 cm in diameter ranging up to 4 cm some being associated with purulent drainage continuous discharge and crusting Dystrophic calcinosis cutis has also been reported Other serious sequelae include sialolithiasis of the submandibular gland and adenolymphoma of the parotid gland The histopathology of fiddlers neck frequently shows hyperkeratosis and acanthosis along with plugging of follicles Histiocytic infiltration with granulomas to foreign body and follicular cysts are also common Foreign body granulomas are thought to derive from abrasion of the wooden surface of the chin rest and its absorption into the superficial dermis The location and complex mechanism of causation for fiddlers neck give rise to a wider spectrum of skin changes when compared to contact dermatitis from more common irritants Fiddlers neck can be differentiated from rosacea and sarcoid reaction with granulomas
Morphea most often presents as macules or plaques a few centimeters in diameter but also may occur as bands or in guttate lesions or nodules 171 Morphea is a thickening and hardening of the skin and subcutaneous tissues from excessive collagen deposition Morphea includes specific conditions ranging from very small plaques only involving the skin to widespread disease causing functional and cosmetic deformities Morphea discriminates from systemic sclerosis by its supposed lack of internal organ involvement This classification scheme does not include the mixed form of morphea in which different morphologies of skin lesions are present in the same individual Up to 15 of morphea patients may fall into this previously unrecognized category
Bejel usually begins in childhood as a small patch on the mucosa often on the interior of the mouth followed by the appearance of raised eroding lesions on the limbs and trunk Periostitis inflammation of the leg bones is commonly seen and gummas of the nose and soft palate develop in later stages
The classic symptoms of untreated diabetes are unintended weight loss polyuria increased urination polydipsia increased thirst and polyphagia increased hunger Symptoms may develop rapidly weeks or months in type 1 diabetes while they usually develop much more slowly and may be subtle or absent in type 2 diabetes Several other signs and symptoms can mark the onset of diabetes although they are not specific to the disease In addition to the known symptoms listed above they include blurred vision headache fatigue slow healing of cuts and itchy skin Prolonged high blood glucose can cause glucose absorption in the lens of the eye which leads to changes in its shape resulting in vision changes Long term vision loss can also be caused by diabetic retinopathy A number of skin rashes that can occur in diabetes are collectively known as diabetic dermadromes
Many people experience problems with learning and day to day tasks with difficulties over time Adults with this disorder can experience the signs and symptoms below talk louder than necessary talk softer than necessary have trouble remembering a list or sequence often need words or sentences repeated have poor ability to memorize information learned by listening interpret words too literally need assistance hearing clearly in noisy environments rely on accommodation and modification strategies find or request a quiet work space away from others request written material when attending oral presentations ask for directions to be given one step at a time
The most common symptoms of Williams syndrome are heart defects and unusual facial features Other symptoms include failure to gain weight appropriately in infancy failure to thrive and low muscle tone People with WS tend to have widely spaced teeth a long philtrum and a flattened nasal bridge Most people with WS are highly verbal relative to their intelligence and are often very sociable having what has been described as a cocktail party type personality People with Williams syndrome hyperfocus on the eyes of others in social engagements
GPP presents as pustules and plaques over a wide area of the body It differs from the localized form of pustular psoriasis in that patients are often febrile and systemically ill However the most prominent symptom as described in the Archives of Dermatology is sheeted pinhead sized sterile sub corneal pustules The IPC roundtable adds that these pustules often occur either at the edges of expanding intensely inflammatory plaques or within erythrodermic skin
Primary PCL The clinical presentation of primary PCL pPCL indicates a far more aggressive disease than that of a typical multiple myeloma case with its clinical features being a combination of those found in multiple myeloma and acute leukemia Like multiple myeloma patients pPCL patients exhibit pathologically high levels of monoclonal plasma cells in their bone marrow plus a malignant plasma cell secreted circulating monoclonal myeloma protein either IgG IgA a light chain or none in 28 56 4 7 23 44 or 0 12 of cases respectively Similar to B cell leukemias but unlike multiple myeloma pPCL patients exhibit relative high frequencies of splenomegaly lymphadenopathy hepatomegaly kidney failure bone marrow failure i e thrombocytopenia anemia and or rarely leukopenia central nervous system defects and peripheral neuropathies due to the invasion of these tissues by plasma cells and or the deposition of their circulating monoclonal immunoglobulin in them Compared to multiple myeloma patients pPCL patients also exhibit 1 high rates of developing a hypercalcemic crisis i e a potentially life threatening episode of high ionic calcium Ca2 levels in the blood due to excess bone re absorption and or renal failure b higher levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and Beta 2 microglobulin and c lower rates of bone but higher rates of soft tissue plasma cell tumors termed plasmacytomas
Long term reduced eyesight Central or paracentral scotomaVision loss due to solar retinopathy is typically reversible lasting for as short as one month to over one year The fundus changes are variable and usually bilateral mild cases often show no alteration and moderate to severe cases show a foveal yellow spot on the first days after exposure After a few days it is replaced by a reddish dot often surrounded by pigment Permanent holes and lesions are possible prognosis worsens with dilated pupils or prolonged exposure
It begins as painless reddish brown nodules which slowly enlarge to form irregularly shaped red plaque
Diagnosis Twenty percent of infants born with meconium peritonitis will have vomiting and dilated bowels on x rays which necessitates surgery Meconium peritonitis is sometimes diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound where it appears as calcifications within the peritoneum
The areas most affected are the toes fingers earlobes nose Blistering of affected area Burning and itching sensation in extremities Dermatitis in extremities Ulceration severe cases only Erythema blanchable redness of the skin Pain in affected area Skin discoloration red to dark blueChilblains caused by exposure to low temperatures usually heal within 7 14 days
Savant skills are usually found in one or more of five major areas art memory arithmetic musical abilities and spatial skills The most common kinds of savants are calendrical savants human calendars who can calculate the day of the week for any given date with speed and accuracy or recall personal memories from any given date Advanced memory is the key superpower in savant abilities Approximately half of savants are autistic the other half often have some form of central nervous system injury or disease It is estimated that up to 10 of those with autism have some form of savant abilities
Signs and symptoms of drug induced lupus erythematosus include the following Joint pain arthralgia and muscle pain myalgia Fatigue Serositis inflammation of the tissues lining the heart and lungs Anti histone antibodies in 95 of cases among those taking procainamide hydralazine chlorpromazine and quinidine however these antibodies have been found in a smaller proportion of patients associated with other medications including minocycline propylthiouracil and statins These signs and symptoms are not side effects of the drugs taken which occur during short term use DIL occurs over long term and chronic use of the medications listed below While these symptoms are similar to those of systemic lupus erythematosus they are generally not as severe unless they are ignored which leads to more harsh symptoms and in some reported cases death
Individuals typically present with either intermittent pain coming and going a lump or mass all which are classic signs of a bowel obstruction The patient may have a protuberance when standing in an upright position although discomfort can sometimes be confused by its anatomical region for a peptic ulceration The bulge may be painful when the patient stretches but then goes away when they are lying down in a resting position However a number of patients present with no obvious symptoms but vague tenderness along the area in which the Spigelian fascia is located
The main symptom of aquagenic urticaria is the development of physical hives which may or may not itch Itching after contact with water without the development of physical hives is known as aquagenic pruritus Aquadynia is a condition in which pain occurs after contact with water In severe cases drinking water can result in swelling of the oral cavity swelling of the throat and in extreme cases anaphylaxis The hives associated with aquagenic urticaria are typically small approximately 1 3 mm red or skin colored welts called wheals with clearly defined edges It most commonly develops on the neck upper trunk and arms although it can occur anywhere on the body Once the water source is removed the rash generally fades within 30 to 60 minutes Water in all forms such as tap or sea water swimming pool water sweat tears and saliva can induce the lesions
A person experiencing caries may not be aware of the disease The earliest sign of a new carious lesion is the appearance of a chalky white spot on the surface of the tooth indicating an area of demineralization of enamel This is referred to as a white spot lesion an incipient carious lesion or a micro cavity As the lesion continues to demineralize it can turn brown but will eventually turn into a cavitation cavity Before the cavity forms the process is reversible but once a cavity forms the lost tooth structure cannot be regenerated A lesion that appears dark brown and shiny suggests dental caries were once present but the demineralization process has stopped leaving a stain Active decay is lighter in color and dull in appearance As the enamel and dentin are destroyed the cavity becomes more noticeable The affected areas of the tooth change color and become soft to the touch Once the decay passes through the enamel the dentinal tubules which have passages to the nerve of the tooth become exposed resulting in pain that can be transient temporarily worsening with exposure to heat cold or sweet foods and drinks A tooth weakened by extensive internal decay can sometimes suddenly fracture under normal chewing forces When the decay has progressed enough to allow the bacteria to overwhelm the pulp tissue in the center of the tooth a toothache can result and the pain will become more constant Death of the pulp tissue and infection are common consequences The tooth will no longer be sensitive to hot or cold but can be very tender to pressure Dental caries can also cause bad breath and foul tastes In highly progressed cases an infection can spread from the tooth to the surrounding soft tissues Complications such as cavernous sinus thrombosis and Ludwig angina can be life threatening
The distribution of disease in those affected with MIH can vary greatly It can be common for the enamel of one molar to be affected while the enamel of the contralateral molar is clinically unaffected or with minor defects only
Symptoms may include irritation of the skin around the bunion and blisters may form more easily at the site Pain may be worse when walking Bunions can lead to difficulties finding properly fitting footwear and may force a person to buy a larger size shoe to accommodate the width of the bunion If the bunion deformity becomes severe enough the foot can hurt in different places even without the constriction of shoes It is then considered as being a mechanical function problem of the forefoot
Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis features a small goiter without tenderness This condition tends to have a phase of hyperthyroidism followed by a return to a euthyroid state and then a phase of hypothyroidism followed again by a return to the euthyroid state The time span of each phase can vary however each phase usually lasts 2 3 months
In hyperacusis the symptoms are ear pain annoyance distortions and general intolerance to many sounds that most people are unaffected by Crying spells or panic attacks may result from the experience of hyperacusis It may affect only one or both ears Hyperacusis can also be accompanied by tinnitus Hyperacusis can result in anxiety stress and phonophobia Avoidant behavior is often a response to prevent the effects of hyperacusis and this can include avoiding social situations
Onset of symptoms is typically 7 to 21 days after exposure In 80 of those who are infected few or no symptoms occur These mild symptoms may include fever tiredness weakness and headache In 20 of people more severe symptoms such as bleeding gums breathing problems vomiting chest pain or dangerously low blood pressure may occur Long term complications may include hearing loss In those who are pregnant miscarriage may occur in 95 of child bearing women Lassa fever can be difficult to distinguish clinically from other viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola virus disease A combination of pharyngitis pain behind the sternum presence of excess protein in the urine and fever can indicate Lassa fever with higher specificity In cases in which death occurs this typically occurs within 14 days of onset About 1 of all Lassa virus infections result in death Approximately 15 20 of those who have required hospitalization for Lassa fever die The risk of death is greater in those who are pregnant A Swollen baby syndrome may occur in newborns infants and toddlers with pitting edema abdominal distension and bleeding
Symptoms depend on the type of HSP inherited The main feature of the disease is progressive spasticity in the lower limbs due to pyramidal tract dysfunction This also results in brisk reflexes extensor plantar reflexes muscle weakness and variable bladder disturbances Furthermore among the core symptoms of HSP are also included abnormal gait and difficulty in walking decreased vibratory sense at the ankles and paresthesia Individuals with HSP can experience extreme fatigue associated with central nervous system and neuromuscular disorders which can be disabling Initial symptoms are typically difficulty with balance stubbing the toe or stumbling Symptoms of HSP may begin at any age from infancy to older than 60 years If symptoms begin during the teenage years or later then spastic gait disturbance usually progresses over many years Canes walkers and wheelchairs may eventually be required although some people never require assistance devices Disability has been described as progressing more rapidly in adult onset forms More specifically patients with the autosomal dominant pure form of HSP reveal normal facial and extraocular movement Although jaw jerk may be brisk in older subjects there is no speech disturbance or difficulty of swallowing Upper extremity muscle tone and strength are normal In the lower extremities muscle tone is increased at the hamstrings quadriceps and ankles Weakness is most notable at the iliopsoas tibialis anterior and to a lesser extent hamstring muscles In the complex form of the disorder additional symptoms are present These include peripheral neuropathy amyotrophy ataxia intellectual disability ichthyosis epilepsy optic neuropathy dementia deafness or problems with speech swallowing or breathing Anita Harding classified the HSP in a pure and complicated form Pure HSP presents with spasticity in the lower limbs associated with neurogenic bladder disturbance as well as lack of vibration sensitivity pallhypesthesia On the other hand HSP is classified as complex when lower limb spasticity is combined with any additional neurological symptom This classification is subjective and patients with complex HSPs are sometimes diagnosed as having cerebellar ataxia with spasticity intellectual disability with spasticity or leukodystrophy Some of the genes listed below have been described in other diseases than HSP before Therefore some key genes overlap with other disease groups
Conversion disorder begins with some stressor trauma or psychological distress Usually the physical symptoms of the syndrome affect the senses or movement Common symptoms include blindness partial or total paralysis inability to speak deafness numbness difficulty swallowing incontinence balance problems seizures tremors and difficulty walking The symptom of feeling unable to breathe but where the lips are not turning blue can indicate conversion disorder or sleep paralysis Sleep paralysis and narcolepsy can be ruled out with sleep tests These symptoms are attributed to conversion disorder when a medical explanation for the conditions cannot be found Symptoms of conversion disorder usually occur suddenly Conversion disorder is typically seen in people aged 10 to 35 and affects between 0 011 and 0 5 of the general population Conversion disorder can present with motor or sensory symptoms including any of the following Motor symptoms or deficits
Specific symptoms for Kabuki syndrome vary with large differences between affected individuals Most people with Kabuki syndrome have distinctive facial features that include arched eyebrows long eyelashes elongated eyelids with lower lids that turn out prominent ears a flat tip of the nose and a downward slant to the mouth Overlapping phenotypic features for patients between KDM6A and KDM6B variations include prominent ears abnormal dentition congenital heart disease feeding difficulties cryptorchidism joint hypermobility developmental delay hypotonia and behavioral difficulties Other common symptoms are skeletal abnormalities short stature heart defects feeding difficulties and a failure to thrive vision and hearing difficulties weak muscle tone hypotonia small head size microcephaly and frequent infections Mild to moderate intellectual disability and mild to severe developmental delay are often associated with Kabuki syndrome Infants and young children often experience difficulties relating to hypotonia feeding issues failure to thrive infections surgical repair of heart and palate defects and developmental delays Young children with Kabuki syndrome benefit from early intervention services School age children tend to have fewer medical issues requiring hospitalization though frequent infections hearing loss and feeding issues occur In addition intellectual impairment difficulty with visuospatial tasks and maintaining attention usually require an IEP individualized education plan if the child attends public school Older children and adults report difficulties with anxiety Endocrine abnormalities and immune system abnormalities such as ITP idiopathic thrombocytopenia and CVID common variable immune deficiency are medical issues that tend to present in older children adolescents and adults
The onset of this disease can begin even before birth but is more commonly in childhood or later into adult life The progression is slow with symptoms of weakness and walking difficulties sometimes not presenting until middle age Early symptoms include Gowers sign climbing up the thighs with the hands when rising from the floor and tiptoe walking caused by the beginning of contractures Contractures of the fingers are a typical symptom of Bethlem myopathy but not of the related Ullrichs myopathy which does include contractures of arms and legs as does Bethlem myopathy Serum creatine kinase is elevated in Bethlem myopathy as there is ongoing muscle cell death Patients with Bethlem myopathy may expect a normal life span and continued mobility into adulthood
Long bone involvement is almost universal in ECD patients and is bilateral and symmetrical in nature More than 50 of cases have some sort of extraskeletal involvement This can include kidney skin brain and lung involvement and less frequently retroorbital tissue pituitary gland and heart involvement is observed Bone pain is the most frequent of all symptoms associated with ECD and mainly affects the lower limbs knees and ankles The pain is often described as mild but permanent and juxtaarticular in nature Exophthalmos occurs in some patients and is usually bilateral symmetric and painless and in most cases it occurs several years before the final diagnosis Recurrent pericardial effusion can be a manifestation as can morphological changes in adrenal size and infiltration A review of 59 case studies by Veyssier Belot et al in 1996 reported the following symptoms in order of frequency of occurrence Bone pain Retroperitoneal fibrosis Diabetes insipidus Exophthalmos Xanthomas Neurological signs including ataxia Dyspnea caused by interlobular septal and pleural thickening Kidney failure Hypopituitarism Liver failure
Clinically there is a number of physiological results that serve as evidence of occlusal trauma Progressive Tooth mobility Fremitus Tooth migration Pain Thermal sensitivity Pain on chewing or percussion Wear facets
Since the inner ear is not directly accessible to instruments identification is by patient report of the symptoms and audiometric testing Of those who present to their doctor with sensorineural hearing loss 90 report having diminished hearing 57 report having a plugged feeling in ear and 49 report having ringing in ear tinnitus About half report vestibular vertigo problems For a detailed exposition of symptoms useful for screening a self assessment questionnaire was developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology called the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults HHIA It is a 25 question survey of subjective symptoms
The triphalangeal thumb has a different appearance than normal thumbs The appearance can differ widely the thumb can be a longer thumb it can be deviated in the radio ulnar plane clinodactyly or thumb strength can be diminished In the case of a five fingered hand it has a finger like appearance with the position in the plane of the four fingers thenar muscle deficiency and additional length There is often a combination with radial polydactyly
The only sign of vitiligo is the presence of pale patchy areas of depigmented skin which tend to occur on the extremities Some people may experience itching before a new patch occurs The patches are initially small but often grow and change shape When skin lesions occur they are most prominent on the face hands and wrists The loss of skin pigmentation is particularly noticeable around body orifices such as the mouth eyes nostrils genitalia and umbilicus Some lesions have increased skin pigment around the edges Those affected by vitiligo who are stigmatized for their condition may experience depression and similar mood disorders
Most patients with thin basement membrane disease are incidentally discovered to have microscopic hematuria on urinalysis The blood pressure kidney function and the urinary protein excretion are usually normal Mild proteinuria less than 1 5 g day and hypertension are seen in a small minority of patients Frank hematuria and loin pain should prompt a search for another cause such as kidney stones or loin pain hematuria syndrome Also there are no systemic manifestations so presence of hearing impairment or visual impairment should prompt a search for hereditary nephritis such as Alport syndrome
Significant pain sometimes felt along the arm past the shoulder Sensation that the shoulder is slipping out of the joint during abduction and external rotation Shoulder and arm held in external rotation anterior dislocation or adduction and internal rotation posterior dislocation Resistance of all movement Numbness of the arm Visibly displaced shoulder Some dislocations result in the shoulder appearing unusually square No palpable bone on the side of the shoulder
The infant with neonatal hepatitis usually has jaundice that appears at one to two months of age is not gaining weight and growing normally and has an enlarged liver and spleen Infants with this condition are usually jaundiced Jaundice that is caused by neonatal hepatitis is not the same as physiologic neonatal jaundice In contrast with physiologic neonatal jaundice infants with neonatal hepatitis present with dark urine Infants may also present with delayed growth
Typically amastia patients have both their nipple and areola missing and the nipple may be absent on one or both sides of the breasts Abnormalities are not often associated with the breasts However symptoms such as hypertelorism saddle nose cleft palate urologic disorders and dysfunction of muscle upper and lower limb have been observed Sometimes several members of a family can be diagnosed as amastia simultaneously all of them are carriers of mutations in TBX3 gene This mutation could cause various abnormalities not only amastia but also deformation of limb and teeth Cases of unilateral amastia are uncommon and they are often associated with hypoplasia of pectoral major muscle and or the thorax Bilateral amastia is more common because it is often associated with other different syndromes Therefore the symptoms of bilateral amastia are easier to be diagnosed Various associated syndromes are listed below
Patients may have no specific symptoms In some cases patients may complain of lessened visual acuity or changes in their perceived visual field and such changes may be secondary to or different from symptoms normally associated with cataracts or glaucoma PEX is characterized by tiny microscopic white or grey granular flakes which are clumps of proteins within the eye which look somewhat like dandruff when seen through a microscope and which are released by cells The abnormal flakes sometimes compared to amyloid like material are visible during an examination of the lens of an eye by an ophthalmologist or optometrist which is the usual diagnosis The white fluffy material is seen in many tissues both ocular and extraocular such as in the anterior chamber structures trabecular meshwork central disc zonular fibres anterior hyaloid membrane pupillary and anterior iris trabecula and occasionally the cornea The flakes are widespread One report suggested that the granular flakes were from abnormalities of the basement membrane in epithelial cells and that they were distributed widely throughout the body and not just within structures of the eye There is some research suggesting that the material may be produced in the iris pigment epithelium ciliary epithelium or the peripheral anterior lens epithelium A similar report suggests that the proteins come from the lens iris and other parts of the eye A report in 2010 found indications of an abnormal ocular surface in PEX patients discovered by an eye staining method known as rose bengal
The following symptoms signs are consistent with complement deficiency in general
Confusion or lack of alertness Loss of consciousness A sudden and ongoing rapid heartbeat Sweating Pale skin A weak pulse Rapid breathing Decreased or no urine output Cool hands and feet
Among the signs and symptoms of acute proliferative glomerulonephritis are the following
The syndrome is a combined manifestation of two namesake disorders Wernicke encephalopathy and alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome It involves an acute Wernicke encephalopathy phase followed by the development of a Korsakoff syndrome phase
A primary spontaneous pneumothorax PSP tends to occur in a young adult without underlying lung problems and usually causes limited symptoms Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features People who are affected by a PSP are often unaware of the potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention PSPs more commonly occur during changes in atmospheric pressure explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax may happen in clusters It is rare for a PSP to cause a tension pneumothorax Secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces SSPs by definition occur in individuals with significant underlying lung disease Symptoms in SSPs tend to be more severe than in PSPs as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs Hypoxemia decreased blood oxygen levels is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis blue discoloration of the lips and skin Hypercapnia accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood is sometimes encountered this may cause confusion and if very severe may result in comas The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD cystic fibrosis or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax Traumatic pneumothorax most commonly occurs when the chest wall is pierced such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises the integrity of the involved structures Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma with only rib fractures being more common in this group The pneumothorax can be occult not readily apparent in half of these cases but may enlarge particularly if mechanical ventilation is required They are also encountered in people already receiving mechanical ventilation for some other reason Upon physical examination breath sounds heard with a stethoscope may be diminished on the affected side partly because air in the pleural space dampens the transmission of sound Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations to the surface of the chest may be altered Percussion of the chest may be perceived as hyperresonant like a booming drum and vocal resonance and tactile fremitus can both be noticeably decreased Importantly the volume of the pneumothorax may not be well correlated with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small
Symptoms may range from stridor during exercise to complete obstruction of the airway In idiopathic cases symptoms may be mistaken for asthma In congenital cases symptoms occur soon after birth and include difficulty breathing stridor and air hunger If the vocal cords are affected symptoms may include inability to make sound and an unusual cry
Those affected by arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy may not have any symptoms at all despite having significant abnormalities in the structure of their hearts If symptoms do occur the initial presentation is often due to abnormal heart rhythms arrhythmias which in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy may take the form of palpitations or blackouts Sudden death may be the first presentation of ACM without any preceding symptoms These symptoms often occur during adolescence and early adulthood but signs of ACM may rarely be seen in infants As ACM progresses the muscle tissue within the ventricles may dilate and weaken The right ventricle typically weakens first leading to fatigue and ankle swelling In the later stages of the disease in which both ventricles are involved shortness of breath may develop especially when lying flat The first clinical signs of ACM are usually during adolescence and early adulthood However rarely signs of ACM have been demonstrated in infants
When mast cells undergo degranulation the substances that are released can cause a number of symptoms that can vary over time and can range in intensity from mild to severe Because mast cells play a role in allergic reactions the symptoms of mastocytosis often are similar to the symptoms of an allergic reaction They may include but are not limited to Fatigue Skin lesions urticaria pigmentosa itching and dermatographic urticaria skin writing Dariers Sign a reaction to stroking or scratching of urticaria lesions Abdominal discomfort Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Olfactive intolerance Ear nose throat inflammation Anaphylaxis shock from allergic or immune causes Episodes of very low blood pressure including shock and faintness Bone or muscle pain Decreased bone density or increased bone density osteoporosis or osteosclerosis Headache Depression Ocular discomfort Increased stomach acid production causing peptic ulcers increased stimulation of enterochromaffin cell and direct histamine stimulation on parietal cell Malabsorption due to inactivation of pancreatic enzymes by increased acid HepatosplenomegalyThere are few qualitative studies about the effects of mastocytosis on daily life However a Danish study from 2018 describes the multidimensional impact of the disease on everyday life
Patients typically have no symptoms until the third or fourth decade of life In most cases the disease is discovered incidentally on routine chest Xray The most common symptoms include the following dyspnea dry cough chest pain sporadic hemoptysis asthenia pneumothoraces
Pain which can vary in severity is a common symptom in virtually all types of arthritis Other symptoms include swelling joint stiffness redness and aching around the joint s Arthritic disorders like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis can affect other organs in the body leading to a variety of symptoms Symptoms may include Inability to use the hand or walk Stiffness in one or more joints Rash or itch Malaise and fatigue Weight loss Poor sleep Muscle aches and pains Tenderness Difficulty moving the jointIt is common in advanced arthritis for significant secondary changes to occur For example arthritic symptoms might make it difficult for a person to move around and or exercise which can lead to secondary effects such as
Potential signs and symptoms include Cardiovascular Raynauds phenomenon is the presenting symptom in 30 of affected persons occurs in 95 of affected individuals at some time during their illness healed pitting ulcers on the fingertips skin and mucosal telangiectasis palpitations irregular heart rate and fainting due to conduction abnormalities hypertension and congestive heart failure Digestive gastroesophageal reflux disease bloating indigestion loss of appetite diarrhoea alternating with constipation sicca syndrome and its complications loosening of teeth and hoarseness due to acid reflux Pulmonary progressive worsening of shortness of breath chest pain due to pulmonary artery hypertension and dry persistent cough due to interstitial lung disease Musculoskeletal joint muscle aches loss of joint range of motion carpal tunnel syndrome and muscle weakness Genitourinary erectile dysfunction dyspareunia kidney problems or kidney failure Other facial pain due to trigeminal neuralgia hand paresthesias headache stroke fatigue calcinosis and weight loss
Netherton syndrome is characterized by chronic skin inflammation universal pruritus itch severe dehydration and stunted growth Patients with this disorder tend to have a hair shaft defect trichorrhexis invaginata also known as bamboo hair The disrupted skin barrier function in affected individuals also presents a high susceptibility to infection and allergy leading to the development of scaly reddish skin similar to atopic dermatitis In severe cases these atopic manifestations persist throughout the individuals life and consequently post natal mortality rates are high In less severe cases this develops into the milder ichthyosis linearis circumflexa Netherton syndrome has recently been characterised as a primary immunodeficiency which straddles the innate and acquired immune system much as does Wiskott Aldrich syndrome A group of Netherton patients have been demonstrated to have altered immunoglobulin levels typically high IgE and low to normal IgG and immature natural killer cells These Natural Killer cells have a reduced lytic function which can be improved with regular infusions of immunoglobulin see Treatment although the mechanism for this is not clear Patients are more prone than healthy people to infections of all types especially recurrent skin infections with staphylococcus They may have more severe infections but are not as vulnerable to opportunistic pathogens as patients with true Natural Killer cell deficiency type SCID
Emphysema is a respiratory disease of the lower respiratory tract It is commonly caused by tobacco smoking but a significant number of people are affected who either do not smoke or have never smoked The presence of emphysema is a clear risk factor for the development of lung cancer made stronger in those who smoke Early symptoms of emphysema may vary from person to person Symptoms can include a cough with or without sputum wheezing a fast breathing rate breathlessness on exertion and a feeling of tightness in the chest There may be frequent cold or flu infections Other symptoms may include anxiety depression fatigue sleep problems and weight loss Since these symptoms could also relate to other lung conditions or other health problems emphysema is often under diagnosed The shortness of breath caused by emphysema can increase over time and develop into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease A sign of emphysema in smokers is the finding of a higher number of alveolar macrophages sampled from the bronchoalveolar lavage BAL in the lungs The number can be four to six times greater in those who smoke than in non smokers
Symptoms of toxic shock syndrome TSS vary depending on the underlying cause TSS resulting from infection with the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus typically manifests in otherwise healthy individuals via signs and symptoms including high fever accompanied by low blood pressure malaise and confusion which can rapidly progress to stupor coma and multiple organ failure The characteristic rash often seen early in the course of illness resembles a sunburn conversely streptococcal TSS will rarely involve a sunburn like rash and can involve any region of the body including the lips mouth eyes palms and soles of the feet In patients who survive the rash desquamates peels off after 10 21 days STSS caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes or TSLS typically presents in people with pre existing skin infections with the bacteria These individuals often experience severe pain at the site of the skin infection followed by rapid progression of symptoms as described above for TSS
MODY is the final diagnosis in 1 2 of people initially diagnosed with diabetes The prevalence is 70 110 per million people 50 of first degree relatives will inherit the same mutation giving them a greater than 95 lifetime risk of developing MODY themselves For this reason correct diagnosis of this condition is important Typically patients present with a strong family history of diabetes any type and the onset of symptoms is in the second to fifth decade There are two general types of clinical presentation
Encephalitis lethargica is characterized by high fever sore throat headache lethargy double vision delayed physical and mental response sleep inversion and catatonia In severe cases patients may enter a coma like state akinetic mutism Patients may also experience abnormal eye movements oculogyric crises Parkinsonism upper body weakness muscular pains tremors neck rigidity and behavioral changes including psychosis Klazomania a vocal tic is sometimes present
While the definitive presentation of the disease is a patient having bowed lower limbs and sex reversal in 46 XY males there are other clinical criteria that can be used absent these characteristics to make the diagnosis Patients may present with shortened and angulated lower limbs a vertically oriented and narrow pelvis an enlarged head an undersized jaw cleft palate flat nasal bridge low set ears club feet On radiographs underdeveloped shoulder blades dislocated hips hypoplastic vertebral pedicles in the thoracic region 11 pairs of ribs instead of 12 or kyphosis of the cervical spine are useful diagnostic clues Respiratory distress can be caused by an underdeveloped trachea which collapses on inhalation or by insufficient rib cage development
If ovarian hormones are present after the ovaries are removed can be a sign that ovarian tissue still remains Signs and symptoms may include pelvic pain a pelvic mass or the absence of menopause after oophorectomy Factors may include pelvic adhesions limiting ability to see the ovary or causing it to adhere to other tissues anatomic variations bleeding during surgery or poor surgical technique Treatment is indicated for people with symptoms and typically involves surgery to remove the residual tissue Therapy for those who refuse surgery cannot have surgery or do not have a pelvic mass may include hormonal therapy to suppress ovarian function Some women have symptoms consistent with endometriosis including difficult or painful intercourse urinary symptoms or bowel symptoms It is likely that some women with ORS dont have any symptoms but the rate of this is unknown In most cases symptoms occur within the first five years of the oophorectomy although there are reports of ORS presenting 20 years after the initial surgery
Almost every symptom known to psychiatry occurs in these mothers every kind of delusion including the rare delusional parasitosis delusional misidentification syndrome Cotard delusion erotomania the changeling delusion denial of pregnancy or birth command hallucinations disorders of the will and self catalepsy and other symptoms of catatonia self mutilation and all the severe disturbances of mood In addition literature from the 18th century also describes symptoms not generally recognized such as rhyming speech enhanced intellect and enhanced perception As for collections of symptoms syndromes about 40 have puerperal mania with increased vitality and sociability reduced need for sleep rapid thinking and pressured speech euphoria and irritability loss of inhibition violence recklessness and grandiosity including religious and expansive delusions puerperal mania is considered to be particularly severe with highly disorganized speech extreme excitement and eroticism Another 25 have an acute polymorphic cycloid syndrome This is a changing clinical state with transient delusions fragments of other syndromes extreme fear or ecstasy perplexity confusion and motility disturbances In the past some experts regarded this as pathognomonic specific for puerperal psychosis but this syndrome is found in other settings not just the reproductive process and in men These psychoses are placed in the World Health Organizations ICD 10 under the rubric of acute and transient psychotic disorders In general psychiatry manic and cycloid syndromes are regarded as distinct but studied long term among childbearing women the bipolar and cycloid variants are intermingled in a bewildering variety of combinations and in this context it seems best to regard them as members of the same bipolar cycloid group Together the manic and cycloid variants make up about two thirds of childbearing psychoses
A female with this condition is hormonally normal that is the woman will enter puberty with development of secondary sexual characteristics including thelarche and pubarche pubic hair The womans karyotype will be 46 XX At least one ovary is intact if not both and ovulation usually occurs Typically the vagina is shortened and intercourse may in some cases be difficult and painful Medical examination supported by gynecologic ultrasonography demonstrates a complete or partial absence of the cervix uterus and vagina If there is no uterus a woman with MRKH cannot carry a pregnancy without intervention It is possible for the woman to have genetic offspring by in vitro fertilization IVF and surrogacy Successful uterine transplant has been performed in limited numbers of patients resulting in several live births but the technique is not widespread or accessible to many women A woman with MRKH typically discovers the condition when during puberty years the menstrual cycle does not start primary amenorrhoea Some find out earlier through surgeries for other conditions such as a hernia
Symptoms typically present in the 3rd or 4th decade of life but have been seen as early as the age of 14 It presents with torsion dystonia particularly when presenting at a younger age which then progresses to parkinsonism with or without ongoing dystonia Often the two symptoms coexist The parkinsonian features of x linked dystonia parkinsonism include festinating gait bradykinesia blepharospasm and postural instability It often lacks a resting tremor helping to differentiate it from Parkinsons disease
The initial phase of hyperthyroid symptoms occurs transiently about two to six months postpartum Typical symptoms include irritability nervousness palpitations and heat intolerance Hormonal disturbances during this phase tend to occur with lower intensity compared with the hypothyroid phase As a result the hyperthyroid phase may pass undetected The second phase of hypothyroid symptoms is also transient and can occur anytime within the three to twelve month period postpartum Women in this phase experience low energy poor memory impaired concentration carelessness dry skin cold intolerance and general aches and pains After one year postpartum euthyroid function resumes Any case with hypothyroid symptoms extending beyond one year postpartum is not considered postpartum thyroiditis Women who test positive for thyroid antibodies may be at increased risk of developing symptoms associated with postpartum depression than women without thyroid antibodies
Pitted keratolysis typically presents with white discoloration of the skin and numerous discrete punched out pitted lesions or erosions usually located on the soles of the feet The pits are typically 1 7 millimeters in diameter These circular and shallow pits are characteristic of pitted keratolysis and often overlap to produce larger areas of erosion The appearance of this condition s characteristic lesions becomes more pronounced when the affected area is wet or submerged in water Occasionally these lesions present with a green or brown hue around and within the pits These superficial erosions are found under the toes and on the soles of the feet and especially at the pressure bearing points such as the heel Typically both feet are equally affected Rarely the condition affects the palms
The symptoms and signs of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia are consistent with Tiredness fatigue Weakness Pale skin
Patients are usually asymptomatic at diagnosis As a result disease is often advanced at diagnosis
The most common symptom of a CSF leak is a fast onset extremely painful orthostatic headache or thunderclap headache This headache is usually made worse by standing and typically becomes prominent throughout the day with the pain becoming less severe when lying down Orthostatic headaches can become chronic and disabling to the point of incapacitation Some patients with a SCSFL will develop headaches that begin in the afternoon This is known as second half of the day headache This may be an initial presentation of a spontaneous CSF leak or appear after treatment such as an epidural patch and likely indicates a slow CSF leak While high CSF pressure can make lying down unbearable low CSF pressure due to a leak can be relieved by lying flat on the back About 50 of people with a CSFL experience neck pain or stiffness nausea and vomiting Other symptoms of a CSF leak include photophobia dizziness and vertigo gait disturbances tinnitus facial numbness or weakness visual disturbances brain fog or difficulties with concentration neuralgia fatigue fluid dripping from the nose or ears Aural symptoms are also present in many cases of intracranial hypotension due to CSF leak including muffled hearing pulsatile tinnitus hearing loss Less common symptoms include double vision due to cranial nerve 6 palsy or tremor Movement disorders are uncommon in spontaneous CSF leaks but occasionally can be one of the major components of the clinical presentation Some cases of chronic intracranial hypotension due to CSF leak may present as personality changes altered behaviors and impairment of executive functions similar to behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia as the frontal and temporal lobes are affected by downward sagging due to reduced intra cranial pressures An untreated CSF leak can result in coma or death as late stage findings as the brainstem herniates through the skull base or foramen magnum
Causes A link to Campylobacter jejuni was suspected when a young girl was admitted to Second Teaching Hospital She had become ill after feeding the family chickens She developed acute paralysis and respiratory failure Investigators discovered that several of the chickens in the home displayed similar symptoms and C jejuni was found in their droppings Several of the paralysis patients were found to have antibodies to C jejuni and anti GD1a antibodies suggesting a link between the pathogen and the disease In 2015 Zika virus was linked to AMAN
The main symptom is choking and difficulty or inability to breathe or speak a feeling of suffocation which may be followed by hypoxia induced loss of consciousness As the airway reopens breathing may cause a high pitched sound called stridor The episode seldom lasts over a couple of minutes before breathing is back to normal
Peripheral Territory Lesions
Patients with an interrupted aortic arch usually have symptoms from birth with nearly all presenting symptoms within two weeks when the ductus arteriosus is usually closed
Most individuals with G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic Most people who develop symptoms are male due to the X linked pattern of inheritance but female carriers can be affected due to unfavorable lyonization or skewed X inactivation where random inactivation of an X chromosome in certain cells creates a population of G6PD deficient red blood cells coexisting with unaffected red blood cells A female with one affected X chromosome will show the deficiency in approximately half of her red blood cells However in some cases including double X deficiency the ratio can be much more than half making the individual almost as sensitive as males Red blood cell breakdown also known as hemolysis in G6PD deficiency can manifest in a number of ways including the following Prolonged neonatal jaundice possibly leading to kernicterus arguably the most serious complication of G6PD deficiency Hemolytic crises in response to Illness especially infections Certain drugs see below Certain foods most notably broad beans from which the word favism derives Certain chemicals Diabetic ketoacidosis Hemoglobinuria red or brown urine Very severe crisis can cause acute kidney injuryFavism is a hemolytic response to the consumption of fava beans also known as broad beans Though all individuals with favism show G6PD deficiency not all individuals with G6PD deficiency show favism The condition is known to be more prevalent in infants and children and G6PD genetic variant can influence chemical sensitivity Other than this the specifics of the chemical relationship between favism and G6PD are not well understood
Most subdural hygromas are small and clinically insignificant A majority of patients with SDG will not experience symptoms However some commonly reported but nonspecific symptoms of SDG that have been reported include headache and nausea Focal neurologic deficits and seizures have also been reported but are nonspecific to SDG Larger hygromas may cause secondary localized mass effects on the adjacent brain parenchyma enough to cause a neurologic deficit or other symptoms Acute subdural hygromas can be a potential neurosurgical emergency requiring decompression Acute hygromas are typically a result of head trauma they are a relatively common posttraumatic lesion but can also develop following neurosurgical procedures and have also been associated with a variety of conditions including dehydration in the elderly lymphoma and connective tissue diseases
Seizures are the main symptom There can be as many as hundreds of seizures a day Seizures tend to begin soon after birth but may sometimes commence during later infancy or rarely during early childhood
The way polysyndactyly presents itself varies when the webbing is mild it gives the appearance of the extra digit being partially connected to the otherwise normal digit next to it when the webbing is extreme the extra digit and the digit next to it will have the appearance of one rather enlarged digit macrodactyly and will have two or more finger toe nails growing in the same digit polyonychia How the nails look will also vary from separate supernumerary finger toe nails to one very wide finger toe nail
The signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease are based on the part of the body that is affected About 66 of patients affected by PAD either do not have symptoms or have atypical symptoms The most common presenting symptom is intermittent claudication which causes pain and severe cramping when walking or exercising The pain is usually located in the calf muscles of the affected leg and relieved by rest This occurs because during exercise the muscles of the leg need more oxygen Normally the arteries would be able to increase the amount of blood flow and therefore increase the amount of oxygen going to the exercised leg However in PAD the artery is unable to respond appropriately to the increased demand for oxygen by the muscles as a result the leg muscles are overly saturated with lactic acid resulting in pain of the muscle that only goes away with rest Other symptoms may include Pain aches and or cramps in the buttocks hip or thigh Muscle atrophy muscle loss of the affected limb Hair loss of the affected limb Skin that is smooth shiny or cool to the touch in the affected area Decreased or absent pulse in feet Cold and or numbness in the toes Sores ulcers on the affected limb that do not healIn individuals with severe PAD complications may arise including critical limb ischemia and gangrene Critical limb ischemia occurs when the obstruction to blood flow in the artery is compromised to the point where the blood is unable to maintain oxygenation of tissue at rest This can lead to pain at rest feeling of cold or numbness in the affected foot and toes Other complications of severe PAD include lower limb tissue loss arterial insufficiency ulcers erectile dysfunction and gangrene People with diabetes are affected by gangrene of the feet at a rate that is 30 times higher than the unaffected population Many of these severe complications are irreversible
Patients come to clinical attention early in life usually at birth or within the first few months with a firm subcutaneous nodule at bridge of nose or as a polypoid mass within the nasal cavity or somewhere along the upper border of the nasal bow If the patient presents with an intranasal mass there may be obstruction chronic rhinosinusitis or nasal drainage If there is a concurrent cerebrospinal fluid CSF leak then an encephalocele is much more likely This lesion is separated into two types based on the anatomic site of presentation
Since the penis does not protrude when a man has this disorder his ability to pass urine when he is standing or to participate in sexual intercourse will be impaired Visible signs may include but are not limited to
Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ although it can be asymptomatic and is discovered by accident in about 5 of cases Common symptoms which tend to be vague include fatigue unrelieved by sleep occurs in up to 85 of cases lack of energy weight loss joint aches and pains which occur in about 70 of cases arthritis 14 38 of cases dry eyes swelling of the knees blurry vision shortness of breath a dry hacking cough or skin lesions Less commonly people may cough up blood Sarcoidosis is also accompanied by psychological distress and symptoms of anxiety and depression which are also associated with fatigue The cutaneous symptoms vary and range from rashes and noduli small bumps to erythema nodosum granuloma annulare or lupus pernio Sarcoidosis and cancer may mimic one another making the distinction difficult The combination of erythema nodosum bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and joint pain is called Löfgren syndrome which has a relatively good prognosis This form of the disease occurs significantly more often in Scandinavian patients than in those of non Scandinavian origin
Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by repetitive involuntary movements Some examples of these types of involuntary movements include Grimacing Tongue movements Lip smacking Lip puckering Pursing of the lips Excessive eye blinking Rapid involuntary movements of the limbs torso and fingers may also occur In some cases an individuals legs can be so affected that walking becomes difficult or impossible These symptoms are the opposite of people who are diagnosed with Parkinsons disease People with Parkinsons have difficulty moving whereas people with tardive dyskinesia have difficulty not moving Respiratory irregularity such as grunting and difficulty breathing is another symptom associated with tardive dyskinesia although studies have shown that the rate of people affected is relatively low Tardive dyskinesia is often misdiagnosed as a mental illness rather than a neurological disorder and as a result people are prescribed neuroleptic drugs which increase the probability that the person will develop a severe and disabling case and shortening the typical survival period Other closely related neurological disorders have been recognized as variants of tardive dyskinesia Tardive dystonia is similar to standard dystonia but permanent Tardive akathisia involves painful feelings of inner tension and anxiety and a compulsive drive to move the body In some extreme cases afflicted individuals experience so much internal tension that they lose their ability to sit still Tardive tourettism is a tic disorder featuring the same symptoms as Tourette syndrome The two disorders are extremely close in nature and often can only be differentiated by the details of their respective onsets Tardive myoclonus a rare disorder presents as brief jerks of muscles in the face neck trunk and extremities AIMS Examination This test is used when psychotropic medications have been prescribed because people sometimes develop tardive dyskinesia due to prolonged use of antipsychotic medications The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale AIMS examination is a test used to identify the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia TD The test is not meant to tell whether there is an absence or presence of tardive dyskinesia It just scales to the level of symptoms indicated by the actions observed The levels range from none to severe The AIMS examination was constructed in the 1970s to measure involuntary facial trunk and limb movements It is best to do this test before and after the administration of the psychotropic drugs Taking the AIMS consistently can help to track severity of TD over time
In the early stages some affected people may complain of a feeling of tightness around the teeth Three signs symptoms must be present to diagnose this condition Severe gum pain Profuse gum bleeding that requires little or no provocation Interdental papillae are ulcerated with dead tissue The papillary necrosis of NUG has been described as punched out Other signs and symptoms may be present but not always Foul breath Bad taste metallic taste Malaise fever and or cervical lymph node enlargement are rare unlike the typical features of herpetic stomatitis Pain is fairly well localized to the affected areas Systemic reactions may be more pronounced in children Cancrum oris noma is a very rare complication usually in debilitated children Similar features but with more intense pain may be seen in necrotizing periodontitis in HIV AIDS
Many people with epidural hematomas experience a lucid period immediately following the injury with a delay before symptoms become evident Because of this initial period of lucidity it has been called Talk and Die syndrome As blood accumulates it starts to compress intracranial structures which may impinge on the third cranial nerve causing a fixed and dilated pupil on the side of the injury The eye will be positioned down and out due to unopposed innervation of the fourth and sixth cranial nerves Other symptoms include severe headache weakness of the extremities on the opposite side from the lesion due to compression of the crossed pyramid pathways and vision loss also on the opposite side due to compression of the posterior cerebral artery In rare cases small hematomas may be asymptomatic If not treated promptly epidural hematomas can cause tonsillar herniation resulting in respiratory arrest The trigeminal nerve may be involved late in the process as the pons is compressed but this is not an important presentation because the person may already be dead by the time it occurs In the case of epidural hematoma in the posterior cranial fossa tonsillar herniation causes Cushings triad hypertension bradycardia and irregular breathing
DM causes muscle weakness early onset of cataracts and myotonia which is delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction Cataracts can be either a cortical cataract with a blue dot appearance or a posterior subcapsular cataract Other organs affected include the heart lungs gastrointestinal tract skin and brain Insulin resistance can also occur Signs and symptoms vary considerably by severity unusual phenotype and form DM1 DM2 DM1 and DM2 differ in regards to the muscles they affect age of onset severity of disease and extramuscular manifestations
Vision loss in toxic and nutritional optic neuropathy is bilateral symmetric painless gradual and progressive Dyschromatopsia a change in color vision is often the first symptom Some patients notice that certain colors particularly red are less bright or vivid others have a general loss of color perception Loss of visual acuity may start with a blur or haze at the point of fixation followed by a progressive decline The degree of vision loss can extend to total blindness but a loss beyond 20 400 is rare except in the case of methanol ingestion Peripheral vision is usually spared since the pattern of loss typically involves a central or cecocentral scotoma a visual field defect at or surrounding the point of fixation This pattern can be revealed via visual field testing Upon examination the pupils usually demonstrate a normal response to light and near stimulation In those who are practically blind the pupils will be dilated with a weak or absent response to light The optic disc may appear normal swollen or hyperemic in early stages With hyperemia disc hemorrhages may also be present Continued damage to the optic nerve results in the development of optic atrophy classically seen as temporal pallor of the optic disc
Syphilis can present in one of four different stages primary secondary latent and tertiary and may also occur congenitally It was referred to as the great imitator by Sir William Osler due to its varied presentations
The most common symptoms of acute interstitial pneumonitis are highly productive cough with expectoration of thick mucus fever and difficulties breathing These often occur over a period of one to two weeks before medical attention is sought The presence of fluid means the person experiences a feeling similar to drowning Difficulties breathing can quickly progress to an inability to breathe without support respiratory failure Acute interstitial pneumonitis typically progresses rapidly with hospitalization and mechanical ventilation often required only days to weeks after initial symptoms of cough fever and difficulties breathing develop
Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability seizures behavioral problems and mental disorders It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin A baby born to a mother who has poorly treated PKU may have heart problems a small head and low birth weight Because the mothers body is able to break down phenylalanine during pregnancy infants with PKU are normal at birth The disease is not detectable by physical examination at that time because no damage has yet been done Newborn screening is performed to detect the disease and initiate treatment before any damage is done The blood sample is usually taken by a heel prick typically performed 2 7 days after birth This test can reveal elevated phenylalanine levels after one or two days of normal infant feeding If a child is not diagnosed during the routine newborn screening test and a phenylalanine restricted diet is not introduced then phenylalanine levels in the blood will increase over time Toxic levels of phenylalanine and insufficient levels of tyrosine can interfere with infant development in ways that have permanent effects The disease may present clinically with seizures hypopigmentation excessively fair hair and skin and a musty odor to the babys sweat and urine due to phenylacetate a carboxylic acid produced by the oxidation of phenylacetone In most cases a repeat test should be done at approximately two weeks of age to verify the initial test and uncover any phenylketonuria that was initially missed Untreated children often fail to attain early developmental milestones develop microcephaly and demonstrate progressive impairment of cerebral function Hyperactivity EEG abnormalities and seizures and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life A characteristic musty or mousy odor on the skin as well as a predisposition for eczema persist throughout life in the absence of treatment The damage done to the brain if PKU is untreated during the first months of life is not reversible It is critical to control the diet of infants with PKU very carefully so that the brain has an opportunity to develop normally Affected children who are detected at birth and treated are much less likely to develop neurological problems or have seizures and intellectual disability though such clinical disorders are still possible including asthma eczema anemia weight gain renal insufficiency osteoporosis gastritis esophagus and kidney deficiencies kidney stones and hypertension Additionally major depressive disorders occur 230 higher than controls dizziness and giddiness occur 180 higher chronic ischemic heart disease asthma diabetes and gastroenteritis occur 170 higher and stress and adjustment disorders occur 160 higher In general however outcomes for people treated for PKU are good Treated people may have no detectable physical neurological or developmental problems at all
This syndrome is most commonly diagnosed when the two or more individuals of concern live in proximity may be socially or physically isolated and have little interaction with other people Various sub classifications of folie à deux have been proposed to describe how the delusional belief comes to be held by more than one person Folie imposée Where a dominant person known as the primary inducer or principal initially forms a delusional belief during a psychotic episode and imposes it on another person or persons the secondary acceptor or associate with the assumption that the secondary person might not have become deluded if left to his or her own devices If the parties are admitted to hospital separately then the delusions in the person with the induced beliefs usually resolve without the need of medication Folie simultanée Either the situation where two people considered to independently experience psychosis influence the content of each others delusions so they become identical or strikingly similar or one in which two people morbidly predisposed to delusional psychosis mutually trigger symptoms in each other Folie à deux and its more populous derivatives are psychiatric curiosities The current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders states that a person cannot be diagnosed as being delusional if the belief in question is one ordinarily accepted by other members of the persons culture or subculture It is not clear at what point a belief considered to be delusional escapes from the folie à diagnostic category and becomes legitimate because of the number of people holding it When a large number of people may come to believe obviously false and potentially distressing things based purely on hearsay these beliefs are not considered to be clinical delusions by the psychiatric profession and are instead labelled as mass hysteria As with most psychological disorders the extent and type of delusion varies but the non dominant persons delusional symptoms usually resemble those of the inducer Prior to therapeutic interventions the inducer typically does not realize that they are causing harm but instead believe they are helping the second person to become aware of vital or otherwise notable information
Eighty percent of self harm involves stabbing or cutting the skin with a sharp object sometimes breaking through the skin entirely However the number of self harm methods are only limited by an individuals inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves this includes burning self poisoning alcohol abuse self embedding of objects hair pulling bruising hitting ones self scratching to hurt ones self knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs and forms of self harm related to anorexia and bulimia The locations of self harm are often areas of the body that are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others As well as defining self harm in terms of the act of damaging the body it may be more accurate to define self harm in terms of the intent and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with Neither the DSM IV TR nor the ICD 10 provide diagnostic criteria for self harm It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder though many people who self harm would like this to be addressed Common signs that a person may be engaging in self harm include the following they ensure that there are always harmful objects close by they are experiencing difficulties in their personal relationships their behavior becomes unpredictable they question their worth and identity they make statements that display helplessness and hopelessness
Academic setting As with other anxiety disorders children with SAD tend to face more obstacles at school than those without anxiety disorders Adjustment and relating school functioning have been found to be much more difficult for anxious children In some severe forms of SAD children may act disruptively in class or may refuse to attend school altogether It is estimated that nearly 75 of children with SAD exhibit some form of school refusal behavior There are several possible manifestations of this disorder when the child is introduced into an academic setting A child with SAD may protest profusely upon arrival at school They might have a hard time saying goodbye to their parents and exhibit behaviors like tightly clinging to the parent in a way that makes it nearly impossible for the parent to detach from them They might scream and cry but in a way that makes it seem as though they were in pain The child might scream and cry for an extended period of time after his or her parents are gone for several minutes to upwards of an hour and refuse to interact with other children or teachers rejecting their attention They might feel an overwhelming need to know where their parents are and that they are okay This is a serious problem because as children fall further behind in coursework it becomes increasingly difficult for them to return to school Short term problems resulting from academic refusal include poor academic performance or decline in performance alienation from peers and conflict within the family Although school refusal behavior is common among children with SAD it is important to note that school refusal behavior is sometimes linked to generalized anxiety disorder or possibly a mood disorder That being said a majority of children with separation anxiety disorder have school refusal as a symptom Up to 80 of children who refuse school qualify for a diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder
Physical problems Physical signs of spina bifida may include
Signs and symptoms of the disease include diarrhea nausea swelling of the legs protein losing enteropathy immunodeficiency and loss of lymphatic fluid into the intestines It is usually diagnosed before the patient is 3 years old but it is sometimes diagnosed in adults
Some common symptoms of hypermobility spectrum disorder include
Ventricular aneurysms usually grow at a very slow pace but can still pose problems Usually this type of aneurysm grows in the left ventricle This bubble has the potential to block blood flow to the rest of the body and thus limit the patients stamina In other cases a similarly developed pseudoaneurysm false aneurysm may burst sometimes resulting in the death of the patient Also blood clots may form on the inside of ventricular aneurysms and form embolisms If such a clot escapes from the aneurysm it will be moved in the circulation throughout the body If it gets stuck inside a blood vessel it may cause ischemia in a limb a painful condition that can lead to reduced movement and tissue death in the limb Alternatively if a clot blocks a vessel going to the brain it can cause a stroke In certain cases ventricular aneurysms cause ventricular failure or arrythmia At this stage treatment is necessary
The mucous membranes of the mouth develop ulcers followed by rapid painful tissue degeneration and necrosis of the tissues of the bones in the face
The symptoms of phocomelia syndrome are undeveloped limbs and absent pelvic bones however various abnormalities can occur to the limbs and bones Usually the upper limbs are not fully formed and sections of the hands and arms may be missing Short arm bones fused fingers and missing thumbs will often occur Sometimes hands or fingers will be present but limp due to having no bones or being loosely attached Legs and feet are also affected similarly to the arms and hands Individuals with phocomelia will often lack thigh bones and the hands or feet may be abnormally small or appear as stumps due to their close attachment to the body According to National Organization for Rare Disorders NORD individuals carrying phocomelia syndrome will generally show symptoms of growth retardation previous to and after birth The syndrome can also cause severe mental deficiencies in infants Infants born with phocomelia will normally have a petite head with sparse hair that may appear silvery blonde Hemangioma the abnormal buildup of blood vessels will possibly develop around the facial area at birth and the eyes may be set widely apart a condition known as orbital hypertelorism The pigment of the eyes will be a bluish white Phocomelia can also cause an undeveloped nose with slender nostrils disfigured ears irregularly petite jaws a condition known as micrognathia and a cleft lip with cleft palate According to NORD severe symptoms of phocomelia include A fissure of the skull and a projecting brain known as encephalocele An accumulation of spinal fluid under the skull also known as hydrocephalus causing vomiting and migraines An abnormally shaped uterus bicornuate Inability to clot blood efficiently due to a low amount of platelets running through the blood Malformations in the kidney and heart Shortened neck Abnormalities in the urethra
Though this condition is usually asymptomatic if symptoms are present they are usually related to the causative process e g hypercalcemia Some of the symptoms that can happen are blood in the urine fever and chills nausea and vomiting severe pain in the belly area flanks of the back groin or testicles These include renal colic polyuria and polydipsia Renal colic is usually caused by pre existing nephrolithiasis as may occur in patients with chronic hypercalciuria Less commonly it can result from calcified bodies moving into the calyceal system Nocturia polyuria and polydipsia from reduced urinary concentrating capacity i e nephrogenic diabetes insipidus as can be seen in hypercalcemia medullary nephrocalcinosis of any cause or in children with Bartter syndrome in whom essential tubular salt reabsorption is compromised There are several causes of nephrocalcinosis that are typically acute and present only with kidney failure These include tumor lysis syndrome acute phosphate nephropathy and occasional cases of enteric hyperoxaluria
The earliest sign of exotropia is usually a noticeable outward deviation of the eye This sign may at first be intermittent occurring when a child is daydreaming not feeling well or tired It may also be more noticeable when the child looks at something in the distance Squinting or frequent rubbing of the eyes is also common with exotropia The child probably will not mention seeing double i e double vision or diplopia However he or she may close one eye to compensate for the problem In children the reason for not seeing double is that the brain may ignore the image it receives from the squinting eye This shutting down is known as Suppression Generally exotropia progresses in frequency and duration As the disorder progresses the eyes start to turn out when looking at close objects as well as those in the distance If left untreated the eye may turn out continually causing a loss of binocular vision or stereopsis In young children with any form of strabismus the brain may learn to ignore the misaligned eyes image and see only the image from the best seeing eye This is called amblyopia or lazy eye and results in a loss of binocular vision impairing depth perception In adults who develop strabismus double vision sometimes occurs because the brain has already been trained to receive images from both eyes and cannot ignore the image from the turned eye Additionally in adults who have had exotropia since childhood the brain may adapt to using a blind spot whereby it receives images from both eyes but no full image from the deviating eye thus avoiding double vision and in fact increasing peripheral vision on the side of the deviating eye According to a study published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology over 90 percent of children with intermittent exotropia become nearsighted by the time they re 20
Typically episodic ataxia presents as bouts of ataxia induced by startle stress or exertion Some patients also have continuous tremors of various motor groups known as myokymia Other patients have nystagmus vertigo tinnitus diplopia or seizures
Ischial bursitis causes pain down the posterior aspect of the upper thigh There may be pain over the ischial tuberosity Chronic ischial bursitis may cause paraesthesia This pain may become immediately more severe when sitting down
In terms of the signs symptoms of haemophilia C unlike individuals with Haemophilia A and B people affected by it are not ones to bleed spontaneously In these cases haemorrhages tend to happen after a major surgery or injury However people affected with haemophilia C might experience symptoms closely related to those of other forms of haemophilia such as the following
The presentation is of gradual loss of the small bones in the carpus and tarsus This may lead to joint subluxation and instability The kidney failure when present usually presents as the presence of protein in the urine In some cases there may also be craniofacial abnormalities including Triangular facies Micrognathia Maxillary hypoplasia ExophthalmosHistology of renal biopsies show glomerulosclerosis and severe tubulointerstitial fibrosis Intellectual disability may occur
Normally skin inflammation connected with hand eczema is accompanied by blister formation and pronounced itching but solid calluses and painful tearing may also occur The quality of life of the affected person is seriously diminished especially in the case of chronic forms of the illness and psychological impact is often very high This impact is enhanced by the high visibility of the illness on the hands which may lead to feelings of shame and fear of rejection
Signs of hyperestrogenism may include heightened levels of one or more of the estrogen sex hormones usually estradiol and or estrone lowered levels of follicle stimulating hormone and or luteinizing hormone due to suppression of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis by estrogen and lowered levels of androgens such as testosterone generally only relevant to males Symptoms of the condition in women may consist of menstrual irregularities amenorrhea abnormal vaginal bleeding and enlargement of the uterus and breasts It may also present as isosexual precocity in children and as hypogonadism gynecomastia feminization impotence and loss of libido in males If left untreated hyperestrogenism may increase the risk of estrogen sensitive cancers such as breast cancer later in life
BAL has similar symptoms to other types of leukemia but they are usually more serious Symptoms caused by bone marrow damage Bruising spotting the reason is lack of platelets it is very common in BAL patients most of patients die due to the A low level of red blood cells in the bloodstream Because the decline of hematopoietic function need blood transfusion therapy Persistent fever infection prolonged healing Diffuse hemorrhage which is dangerous and might lead to death Symptoms caused by blood cancer cells infiltration into tissues Swollen lymph nodes Joint pain Swelling of the gums Enlargement of the liver and spleen Headache and vomiting blood cancer infiltration into the wear performance of the central nervous system Skin lumps Because look was slightly green also known as the Green tumor Pericardial or pleural effusion
Most common mild mycoses often present with a rash Infections within the skin or under the skin may present with a lump and skin changes Less common deeper fungal infections may present with pneumonia like symptoms or meningitis
Intellectual disability hexadactyly central diabetes insipidus blindness usually by 30 years due to central retinal degeneration
As a progressive chronic condition signs and symptoms of Fuchs dystrophy gradually progress over decades of life starting in middle age Early symptoms include blurry vision upon wakening which improves during the morning as fluid retained in the cornea is unable to evaporate through the surface of the eye when the lids are closed overnight As the disease worsens the interval of blurry morning vision extends from minutes to hours In moderate stages of the disease an increase in guttae and swelling in the cornea can contribute to changes in vision and decreased sharpness throughout the day Contrast sensitivity may be affected The change in the refractive index of the cornea may result in subtle refractive shifts which affected individuals may experience as a small change in their eyeglass prescription In the late stages of the disease the cornea is unable to maintain its fluid content and blisters known as bullae form on the surface of the cornea These cause foreign body sensations and can be painful The cornea may not heal from such epithelial defects until corneal transplantation is able to restore the endothelial pump function
Calcinosis Raynauds phenomenon Esophageal dysfunction Sclerodactyly and Telangiectasia CREST syndrome are associated with limited scleroderma Other symptoms include
Many cases are asymptomatic however patients many have decreased vision glare monocular diplopia or polyopia and noticeable iris changes On exam patients have normal to decreased visual acuity and a beaten metal appearance of the corneal endothelium corneal edema increased intraocular pressure peripheral anterior synechiae and iris changes
Infections on the body may give rise to typical enlarging raised red rings of ringworm Infection on the skin of the feet may cause athletes foot and in the groin jock itch Involvement of the nails is termed onychomycosis and they may thicken discolour and finally crumble and fall off They are common in most adult people with up to 20 of the population having one of these infections at any given moment Animals including dogs and cats can also be affected by ringworm and the disease can be transmitted between animals and humans making it a zoonotic disease Specific signs can be
Physical symptoms
Cherry angiomas are made up of clusters of capillaries at the surface of the skin forming a small round dome papule which may be flat topped They range in colour from bright red to purple When they first develop they may be only a tenth of a millimeter in diameter and almost flat appearing as small red dots However they then usually grow to about one or two millimeters across and sometimes to a centimeter or more in diameter As they grow larger they tend to expand in thickness and may take on the raised and rounded shape of a dome Multiple adjoining angiomas form a polypoid angioma Because the blood vessels comprising an angioma are so close to the skins surface cherry angiomas may bleed profusely if they are injured One study found that the majority of capillaries in cherry hemangiomas are fenestrated and stain for carbonic anhydrase activity
Ludwigs angina is a form of severe widespread cellulitis of the floor of the mouth usually with bilateral involvement Infection is usually primarily within the submandibular space and the sublingual and submental spaces can also be involved It presents with an acute onset and spreads very rapidly therefor early diagnosis and immediate treatment planning is vital and lifesaving The external signs may include bilateral lower facial swelling around the jaw and upper neck Signs inside the mouth may include elevation of the floor of mouth due to sublingual space involvement and posterior displacement of the tongue creating the potential for a compromised airway Additional symptoms may include painful neck swelling drooling tooth pain dysphagia shortness of breath fever and general malaise Stridor trismus and cyanosis may also be seen when an impending airway crisis is nearing
Clinically neonates with omphalitis present within the first two weeks of life with signs and symptoms of a skin infection cellulitis around the umbilical stump redness warmth swelling pain pus from the umbilical stump fever fast heart rate tachycardia low blood pressure hypotension somnolence poor feeding and yellow skin jaundice Omphalitis can quickly progress to sepsis and presents a potentially life threatening infection In fact even in cases of omphalitis without evidence of more serious infection such as necrotizing fasciitis mortality is high in the 10 range
Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body but most commonly occurs in the lungs known as pulmonary tuberculosis Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB General signs and symptoms include fever chills night sweats loss of appetite weight loss and fatigue Significant nail clubbing may also occur
This disease is known for an indolent clinical course and incidental discovery The most common physical finding is moderate splenomegaly B symptoms are seen in a third of cases and recurrent infections due to anaemia and or neutropenia are seen in almost half of cases Rheumatoid arthritis is commonly observed in people with T LGLL leading to a clinical presentation similar to Feltys syndrome Signs and symptoms of anemia are commonly found due to the association between T LGLL and erythroid hypoplasia
Dermatofibromas are hard solitary slow growing papules rounded bumps that may appear in a variety of colours usually brownish to tan they are often elevated or pedunculated A dermatofibroma is associated with the dimple sign by applying lateral pressure there is a central depression of the dermatofibroma Although typical dermatofibromas cause little or no discomfort itching and tenderness can occur Dermatofibromas can be found anywhere on the body but most often they are found on the legs and arms They occur most often in women the male to female ratio is about 1 4 The age group in which they most commonly occur is 20 to 45 years Some physicians and researchers believe dermatofibromas form as a reaction to previous injuries such as insect bites or thorn pricks They are composed of disordered collagen laid down by fibroblasts Dermatofibromas are classed as benign skin lesions meaning they are completely harmless though they may be confused with a variety of subcutaneous tumours Deep penetrating dermatofibromas may be difficult to distinguish even histologically from rare malignant fibrohistocytic tumours like dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans Dermatofibromas typically have a positive buttonhole sign or central dimpling in the center
Color blindness describes both a symptom of reduced color perception as well as several conditions where colorblindness is the primary or only symptom This section will focus only on color blindness as a symptom A colorblind subject will have decreased or no color discrimination along the red green axis blue yellow axis or both though the vast majority of the colorblind are only affected on their red green axis The first indication of colorblindness generally consists of a person using the wrong color for an object such as when painting or calling a color by the wrong name The colors that are confused are very consistent among people with the same type of color blindness
Unilateral or bilateral iris coloboma absence of tissue from the colored part of the eyes Preauricular pits tags small depressions growths of skin on the outer ears Anal atresia abnormal obstruction of the anus Downward slanting palpebral fissures openings between the upper and lower eyelids Cleft palate Kidney problems missing extra or underdeveloped kidneys Short stature Scoliosis skeletal problems Cardiac defects such as TAPVR Micrognathia smaller jaw Hernias Biliary atresia Rarer malformations can affect almost any organ Intellectual disability many are intellectually normal about 30 of CES patients have moderately impaired mental development although severe intellectual disability is rare The term cat eye syndrome was coined because of the particular appearance of the vertical colobomas in the eyes of some patients but over half of the CES patients in the literature do not present with this trait
Often a person with a pelvic kidney will go through their whole life not even knowing they have a pelvic kidney
Trauma from a gunshot wound varies widely based on the bullet velocity mass entry point trajectory affected anatomy and exit point Gunshot wounds can be particularly devastating compared to other penetrating injuries because the trajectory and fragmentation of bullets can be unpredictable after entry Moreover gunshot wounds typically involve a large degree of nearby tissue disruption and destruction caused by the physical effects of the projectile correlated with the bullet velocity classification The immediate damaging effect of a gunshot wound is typically severe bleeding with the potential for hypovolemic shock a condition characterized by inadequate delivery of oxygen to vital organs In the case of traumatic hypovolemic shock this failure of adequate oxygen delivery is due to blood loss as blood is the means of delivering oxygen to the bodys constituent parts Devastating effects can result when a bullet strikes a vital organ such as the heart lungs or liver or damages a component of the central nervous system such as the spinal cord or brain Common causes of death following gunshot injury include bleeding low oxygen caused by pneumothorax catastrophic injury to the heart and major blood vessels and damage to the brain or central nervous system Non fatal gunshot wounds frequently have mild to severe long lasting effects typically some form of major disfigurement such as amputation because of a severe bone fracture and may cause permanent disability A sudden blood gush may take effect immediately from a gunshot wound if a bullet directly damages larger blood vessels especially arteries
It is seen as a yellow white deposit on the conjunctiva adjacent to the limbus the junction between the cornea and sclera It is to be distinguished clinically from a pterygium which is a wedge shaped area of fibrosis that may grow onto the cornea A pinguecula usually does not cause any symptoms It is most common in tropical climates and there is a direct correlation with UV exposure Histologically there is degeneration of the collagen fibers of the conjunctival stroma with thinning of the overlying epithelium and occasionally calcification Actinic exposure of the thin conjunctival tissue is thought to cause fibroblasts to produce more elastin fibers which are more twisted than normal elastin fibers and may lead to the degradation of the collagen fibers Alternatively it has been postulated that the sub epithelial collagen fibers undergo degradation and assume the qualities of elastic tissue while fragmenting and twisting in a different configuration from their normal state It is thought that the high reflectivity of the solid white scleral tissue underlying the conjunctival tissue may result in additional UV exposure to the back side of the tissue The side of the nose also reflects sunlight on to the conjunctiva As a result pingueculae tend to occur more often on the nasal side of the eye While most pingueculae are found in people over the age of 40 they are not uncommon in 20 and 30 year old adults who spend significant time in the sun The surface of the conjunctival tissue overlying a pinguecula interferes with the normal spreading of the tear film The tear ferning test reveals abnormalities of the mucous component of the tear film making it useful as a predictor of a persons tolerance of hydrophilic soft contact lenses Contact lens intolerance can also result from the elevation of the peripheral edge of the contact lens if it overlies a pinguecula The plural form of pinguecula is pingueculae Pinguecula is derived from the Latin word pinguis for fat or grease
The most common sign at presentation is leukocoria abnormal white reflection of the retina Symptoms typically begin as blurred vision usually pronounced when one eye is closed due to the unilateral nature of the disease Often the unaffected eye will compensate for the loss of vision in the other eye however this results in some loss of depth perception and parallax Deterioration of sight may begin in either the central or peripheral vision Deterioration is likely to begin in the upper part of the vision field as this corresponds with the bottom of the eye where blood usually pools Flashes of light known as photopsia and floaters are common symptoms Persistent color patterns may also be perceived in the affected eye Initially these may be mistaken for psychological hallucinations but are actually the result of both retinal detachment and foreign fluids mechanically interacting with the photoreceptors located on the retina One early warning sign of Coats disease is yellow eye in flash photography Just as the red eye effect is caused by a reflection off blood vessels in the back of a normal eye an eye affected by Coats will glow yellow in photographs as light reflects off cholesterol deposits Children with yellow eye in photographs are typically advised to immediately seek evaluation from an optometrist or ophthalmologist who will assess and diagnose the condition and refer to a vitreo retinal specialist
Characteristic symptoms are Sudden penetrating pain in the legs lower back or abdomen Confusion psychosis slurred speech Severe lethargy Convulsions Fever Hyperkalemia elevated potassium level in the blood Hypercalcemia elevated calcium level in the blood the cause of hypercalcemia is a combination of increased calcium input into the extracellular space and reduced calcium removal by the kidney this last caused by decreased glomerular filtration and increased tubular calcium reabsorption Both renal factors are secondary to volume depletion and in fact improve rapidly during rehydration with saline infusion Hypoglycemia reduced level of blood glucose Hyponatremia low sodium level in the blood Hypotension low blood pressure Hypothyroidism low T4 level Severe vomiting and diarrhea resulting in dehydration Syncope transient loss of consciousness and or orthostatic hypotension drop in blood pressure on standing leading to loss of balance
Symptoms of amusia are generally categorized as receptive clinical or mixed Symptoms of receptive amusia sometimes referred to as musical deafness or tone deafness include the inability to recognize familiar melodies the loss of ability to read musical notation and the inability to detect wrong or out of tune notes Clinical or expressive symptoms include the loss of ability to sing write musical notation and or play an instrument A mixed disorder is a combination of expressive and receptive impairment Clinical symptoms of acquired amusia are much more variable than those of congenital amusia and are determined by the location and nature of the lesion Brain injuries may affect motor or expressive functioning including the ability to sing whistle or hum a tune oral expressive amusia the ability to play an instrument instrumental amusia or musical apraxia and the ability to write music musical agraphia Additionally brain damage to the receptive dimension affects the faculty to discriminate tunes receptive or sensorial amusia the ability to read music musical alessia and the ability to identify songs that were familiar prior to the brain damage amnesic amusia Research suggests that patients with amusia also have difficulty when it comes to spatial processing Amusics performed more quickly than normal individuals on a combined task of both spatial and musical processing tasks which is most likely due to their deficit Normal individuals experience interference due to their intact processing of both musical and spatial tasks while amusics do not Pitch processing normally depends on the cognitive mechanisms that are usually used to process spatial representations Those with congenital amusia show impaired performance on discrimination identification and imitation of sentences with intonational differences in pitch direction in their final word This suggests that amusia can in subtle ways impair language processing
While the presence of lesions is the denominator among patients with PNP the characteristics of the lesions differ The five clinical presentations of lesions associated with PNP include
Sandhoff disease symptoms are clinically indeterminable from Tay Sachs disease The classic infantile form of the disease has the most severe symptoms and is incredibly hard to diagnose at this early age The first signs of symptoms begin before 6 months of age and the parents notice when the child begins regressing in their development If the children had the ability to sit up by themselves or crawl they will lose this ability This is caused by a slow deterioration of the muscles in the child s body from the buildup of GM2 gangliosides Since the body is unable to create the enzymes it needs within the central nervous system it is unable to attach to these gangliosides to break them apart and make them non toxic With this buildup there are several symptoms that begin to appear such as muscle motor weakness sharp reaction to loud noises blindness deafness inability to react to stimulants respiratory problems and infections mental retardation seizures cherry red spots in the retina enlarged liver and spleen hepatosplenomegaly pneumonia or bronchopneumonia The other two forms of Sandhoff disease have similar symptoms but to a lesser extent Adult and juvenile forms of Sandhoff disease are more rare than the infantile form In these cases victims suffer cognitive impairment retardation and a loss of muscle coordination that impairs and eventually destroys their ability to walk the characteristic red spots in the retina also develop The adult form of the disease however is sometimes milder and may only lead to muscle weakness that impairs walking or the ability to get out of bed

Cocaine increases alertness feelings of well being euphoria energy sociability and sexuality The former are some of the desired effects of cocaine intoxication Not having the normal use of mental faculties by reason of the introduction of cocaine is defined drug intoxication by the laws in America Europe and most of the rest of the World and it is a serious crime in specific contexts e g in drug impaired driving Mild adverse effects include anxiety increased temperature paranoia restlessness and teeth grinding With prolonged use the drug can cause chronic complications like insomnia weight loss anorexia persistent tachycardia heart failure kidney failure hallucinations and paranoid delusions Depression with suicidal ideation may develop in heavy users Finally a loss of vesicular monoamine transporters neurofilament proteins and other morphological changes appear to indicate a long term damage to dopamine neurons Chronic intranasal usage can degrade the cartilage separating the nostrils the nasal septum which can eventually lead to its complete disappearance Studies have shown that cocaine usage during pregnancy triggers premature labor and may lead to abruptio placentae In cases of severe acute intoxication potentially lethal adverse effects include prolonged episodes of arrhythmia i e a group of abnormal heart rhythms that also include tachycardia heavy hypoglycemia tremors convulsions hyperthermia i e markedly increased core temperature untreated uremia myocardial infarction stroke and sudden cardiac arrest
Hypercapnia may happen in the context of an underlying health condition and symptoms may relate to this condition or directly to the hypercapnia Specific symptoms attributable to early hypercapnia are dyspnea breathlessness headache confusion and lethargy Clinical signs include flushed skin full pulse bounding pulse rapid breathing premature heart beats muscle twitches and hand flaps asterixis The risk of dangerous irregularities of the heart beat is increased Hypercapnia also occurs when the breathing gas is contaminated with carbon dioxide or respiratory gas exchange cannot keep up with the metabolic production of carbon dioxide which can occur when gas density limits ventilation at high ambient pressures In severe hypercapnia generally P a C O 2 displaystyle P_ a_ CO_ 2 greater than 10 kPa or 75 mmHg symptomatology progresses to disorientation panic hyperventilation convulsions unconsciousness and eventually death
The first symptoms typically include fever intermittent abdominal pain and an enlarged liver Occasionally yellow discoloration of the skin occurs Caroli disease usually occurs in the presence of other diseases such as autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease cholangitis gallstones biliary abscess sepsis liver cirrhosis kidney failure and cholangiocarcinoma 7 affected People with Caroli disease are 100 times more at risk for cholangiocarcinoma than the general population After recognizing symptoms of related diseases Caroli disease can be diagnosed Morbidity is common and is caused by complications of cholangitis sepsis choledocholithiasis and cholangiocarcinoma These morbid conditions often prompt the diagnosis Portal hypertension may be present resulting in other conditions including enlarged spleen hematemesis and melena These problems can severely affect the patients quality of life In a 10 year period between 1995 and 2005 only 10 patients were surgically treated for Caroli disease with an average patient age of 45 8 years After reviewing 46 cases of Caroli disease before 1990 21 7 of the cases were the result of an intrahepatic cyst or nonobstructive biliary tree dilation 34 7 were linked with congenital hepatic fibrosis 13 were isolated choledochal cystic dilation and the remaining 24 6 had a combination of all three

The main symptom of dysmenorrhea is pain concentrated in the lower abdomen or pelvis It is also commonly felt in the right or left side of the abdomen It may radiate to the thighs and lower back Symptoms often co occurring with menstrual pain include nausea and vomiting diarrhea headache dizziness disorientation fainting and fatigue Symptoms of dysmenorrhea often begin immediately after ovulation and can last until the end of menstruation This is because dysmenorrhea is often associated with changes in hormonal levels in the body that occur with ovulation In particular prostaglandins induce abdominal contractions that can cause pain and gastrointestinal symptoms The use of certain types of birth control pills can prevent the symptoms of dysmenorrhea because they stop ovulation from occurring Dysmenorrhea is associated with increased pain sensitivity and heavy menstrual bleeding For many women primary dysmenorrhea gradually subsides in late second generation Pregnancy has also been demonstrated to lessen the severity of dysmenorrhea when menstruation resumes However dysmenorrhea can continue until menopause 5 15 of women with dysmenorrhea experience symptoms severe enough to interfere with daily activities
Patients with miliary tuberculosis often experience non specific signs such as coughing and enlarged lymph nodes Miliary tuberculosis can also present with enlarged liver 40 of cases enlarged spleen 15 inflammation of the pancreas 5 and multiple organ dysfunction with adrenal insufficiency adrenal glands do not produce enough steroid hormones to regulate organ function Stool may also be diarrheal in nature and appearance Other symptoms include fever hypercalcemia choroidal tubercles and cutaneous lesions Firstly many patients can experience a fever lasting several weeks with daily spikes in morning temperatures Secondly hypercalcemia prevails in 16 to 51 of tuberculosis cases It is thought that hypercalcemia occurs as a response to increased macrophage activity in the body Such that 1 25 dihydroxycholecalciferol also referred to as calcitriol improves the ability of macrophages to kill bacteria however higher levels of calcitriol lead to higher calcium levels and thus hypercalcemia in some cases Thus hypercalcemia proves to be an important symptom of miliary tuberculosis Thirdly chorodial tubercules pale lesions on the optic nerve typically indicate miliary tuberculosis in children These lesions may occur in one eye or both the number of lesions varies between patients Chorodial tubercules may serve as important symptoms of miliary tuberculosis since their presence can often confirm suspected diagnosis Lastly between 10 and 30 of adults and 20 40 of children with miliary tuberculosis have tuberculosis meningitis This relationship results from mycobacteria from miliary tuberculosis spreading to the brain and the subarachnoid space as a result leading to tuberculosis meningitis The risk factors for contracting miliary tuberculosis are being in direct contact with a person who has it living in unsanitary conditions and poor nutrition In the U S risk factors for contracting the disease include homelessness and HIV AIDS

Pain is the most common complaint in those with FAI It is experienced in a number of areas making the diagnosis challenging but commonly occurs in the groin upper buttock lower back the buttock or beneath the buttock side of the affected hip and posterior upper leg Onset of symptoms has been reported to present in both an acute and more gradual manner The pain is often significant enough to cause a decrease in activity level and movement Some will also describe decreased range of motion of the affected hip Another symptom is groin pain associated with activity and no prior history of trauma Inability to perform activities such as high hip flexion or prolong sitting can also be seen in individuals with FAI
People with SzPD are often aloof cold and indifferent which causes interpersonal difficulty Most individuals diagnosed with SzPD have trouble establishing personal relationships or expressing their feelings meaningfully They may remain passive in the face of unfavorable situations Their communication with other people may be indifferent and terse at times Schizoid personality types often lack the ability to assess the impact of their own actions in social situations A person with SzPD may feel suffocated when their personal space is violated and take actions to avoid this feeling People who have SzPD tend to be happiest when in relationships in which their partner places few emotional or intimate demands on them and does not expect phatic or social niceties It is not necessarily people they want to avoid but negative or positive emotional expectations emotional intimacy and self disclosure Therefore it is possible for individuals with SzPD to form relationships with others based on intellectual physical familial occupational or recreational activities as long as there is no need for emotional intimacy Donald Winnicott explains this is because schizoid individuals prefer to make relationships on their own terms and not in terms of the impulses of other people Failing to attain that they prefer isolation In general friendship among schizoids is usually limited to one person often also schizoid forming what has been called a union of two eccentrics within it the ecstatic cult of personality outside it everything is sharply rejected and despised Although there is the belief people with SzPD are complacent and unaware of their feelings many recognize their differences from others Some individuals with SzPD who are in treatment say life passes them by or they feel like living inside a shell they see themselves as missing the bus and speak of observing life from a distance Aaron Beck and his colleagues report that people with SzPD seem comfortable with their aloof lifestyle and consider themselves observers rather than participants in the world around them But they also mention that many of their schizoid patients recognize themselves as socially deviant or even defective when confronted with the different lives of ordinary people especially when they read books or see movies focusing on relationships Even when schizoid individuals may not long for closeness they can become weary of being on the outside looking in These feelings may lead to depression or depersonalization If they do schizoid people often experience feeling like a robot or going through life in a dream According to Guntrip Klein and others people with SzPD may possess a hidden sense of superiority and lack dependence on other peoples opinions This is very different from the grandiosity seen in narcissistic personality disorder which is described as burdened with envy and with a desire to destroy or put down others Additionally schizoids do not go out of their way to achieve social validation 60 Unlike the narcissist the schizoid will often keep their creations private to avoid unwelcome attention or the feeling that their ideas and thoughts are being appropriated by the public 174 The related schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia are reported to have ties to creative thinking and it is speculated that the internal fantasy aspect of SzPD may also be reflective of this thinking Alternatively there has been an especially large contribution of people with schizoid symptoms to science and theoretical areas of knowledge including maths physics economics etc At the same time people with SzPD are helpless at many practical activities because of their symptoms
Cannabis use is associated with comorbid mental health problems such as mood and anxiety disorders and discontinuing cannabis use is difficult for some users Psychiatric comorbidities are often present in dependent cannabis users including a range of personality disorders Based on annual survey data some high school seniors who report smoking daily nearly 7 according to one study may function at a lower rate in school than students that do not The sedating and anxiolytic properties of tetrahydrocannabinol THC in some users might make the use of cannabis an attempt to self medicate personality or psychiatric disorders

The main symptoms of hypoparathyroidism are the result of the low blood calcium level which interferes with normal muscle contraction and nerve conduction As a result people with hypoparathyroidism can experience paresthesia an unpleasant tingling sensation around the mouth and in the hands and feet as well as muscle cramps and severe spasms known as tetany that affect the hands and feet Many also report a number of subjective symptoms such as fatigue headaches bone pain and insomnia Crampy abdominal pain may occur Physical examination of someone with hypocalcemia may show tetany but it is also possible to provoke tetany of the facial muscles by tapping on the facial nerve a phenomenon known as Chvosteks sign or by using the cuff of a sphygmomanometer to temporarily obstruct the blood flow to the arm a phenomenon known as Trousseaus sign of latent tetany A number of medical emergencies can arise in people with low calcium levels These are seizures severe irregularities in the normal heart beat as well as spasm of the upper part of the airways or the smaller airways known as the bronchi both potentially causing respiratory failure
It presents itself in the mouth most frequently as a thick bilateral symmetrical white plaques with a spongy corrugated or velvety texture Most usually the lesions are on the buccal mucosa but sometimes on the labial mucosa alveolar ridge floor of the mouth ventral surface of the tongue or soft palate The gingival margin and dorsum of the tongue are almost never affected Less commonly sites outside the mouth are affected including the nasal esophageal laryngeal anal and genital mucosae It usually is present from birth or develops during childhood Rarely the lesions may develop during adolescence Apart from the appearance of the affected areas there are usually no other signs or symptoms
Brain herniation frequently presents with abnormal posturing a characteristic positioning of the limbs indicative of severe brain damage These patients have a lowered level of consciousness with Glasgow Coma Scores of three to five One or both pupils may be dilated and fail to constrict in response to light Vomiting can also occur due to compression of the vomiting center in the medulla oblongata Severe headaches and seizures as a result of increased intracranial pressure are not uncommon Cardiovascular and pulmonary symptoms may also be present as the brain loses function but might also be associated with bleeding They can include hypertension respiratory depression arrhythmia and in severe cases cardiac arrest

The signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine dependence include feeling unable to cope without the drug unsuccessful attempts to cut down or stop benzodiazepine use tolerance to the effects of benzodiazepines and withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug Some withdrawal symptoms that may appear include anxiety depressed mood depersonalisation derealisation sleep disturbance hypersensitivity to touch and pain tremor shakiness muscular aches pains twitches and headache Benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal have been associated with suicide and self harming behaviors especially in young people The Department of Health substance misuse guidelines recommend monitoring for mood disorder in those dependent on or withdrawing from benzodiazepines Benzodiazepine dependence is a frequent complication for those prescribed for or using for longer than four weeks with physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms being the most common problem but also occasionally drug seeking behavior Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety perceptual disturbances distortion of all the senses dysphoria and in rare cases psychosis and epileptic seizures
Neurologic signs and symptoms include progressively delayed development weak muscle tone hypotonia seizures and abnormal movements The bodys network of blood vessels is also affected Children with this disorder may experience rashes of tiny red spots petechiae caused by bleeding under the skin and blue discoloration in the hands and feet due to reduced oxygen in the blood acrocyanosis Chronic diarrhea is another common feature of ethylmalonic encephalopathy EE is often identified by urine organic acid analysis the excretion of ethylmalonic acid methylsuccinic acid isobutyrylglycine and isovalerylglucine Patients will also often have elevated thiosulphate concentration in their urine The signs and symptoms of ethylmalonic encephalopathy are apparent at birth or begin in the first few months of life Problems with the nervous system typically worsen over time and most affected individuals survive only into early childhood A few children with a milder chronic form of this disorder have been reported and there can be considerable phenotypic variation even within families The life expectancy of individuals with EE is less than ten years
Femoral hernias typically present as a groin lump or bulge which may differ in size during the day based on internal pressure variations of the intestine This lump is typically retort shaped The bulge or lump is typically smaller or may disappear completely in the prone position They may or may not be associated with pain Often they present with a varying degree of complication ranging from irreducibility through intestinal obstruction to frank gangrene of contained bowel The incidence of strangulation in femoral hernias is high A femoral hernia has often been found to be the cause of unexplained small bowel obstruction The cough impulse is often absent and is not relied on solely when making a diagnosis of femoral hernia The lump is more globular than the pear shaped lump of the inguinal hernia The bulk of a femoral hernia lies below an imaginary line drawn between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic tubercle which essentially represents the inguinal ligament whereas an inguinal hernia starts above this line Nonetheless it is often impossible to distinguish the two preoperatively
The hormones of the pituitary have different actions in the body and the symptoms of hypopituitarism therefore depend on which hormone is deficient The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes In most of the cases three or more hormones are deficient The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle stimulating hormone FSH and or luteinizing hormone LH leading to sex hormone abnormalities Growth hormone deficiency is more common in people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes Sometimes there are additional symptoms that arise from the underlying cause for instance if the hypopituitarism is due to a growth hormone producing tumor there may be symptoms of acromegaly enlargement of the hands and feet coarse facial features and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm there may be visual field defects Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors as well as pituitary apoplexy infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor and lymphocytic hypophysitis autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary Apoplexy in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles Pituitary failure results in many changes in the skin hair and nails as a result of the absence of pituitary hormone action on these sites
Children with Weaver syndrome tend to look similar and have distinctive physical and craniofacial characteristics which may include several but not all of the following features
The symptoms of urethritis can include pain or a burning sensation upon urination dysuria a white cloudy discharge and a feeling that one needs to pass urine frequently For men the signs and symptoms are discharge from the penis burning or pain when urinating itching irritation or tenderness In women the signs and symptoms are discharge from vagina burning or pain when urinating anal or oral infections abdominal pain or abnormal vaginal bleeding which may be an indication that the infection has progressed to Pelvic Inflammatory Disease NGU is transmitted by touching the mouth penis vagina or anus by penis vagina or anus of a person who has NGU NGU is more common in men than women Men may have a discharge strange liquid from the penis pain when urinating and itching irritation or tenderness around the opening of the penis Women might not have any symptoms and may not know they have NGU until severe problems occur Women might have discharge from the vagina burning or pain when urinating pain in the abdominal stomach area or bleeding from the vagina that is not from a monthly period This may be an sign that NGU has become worse and turned into Pelvic Inflammatory Disease or PID
People with TIC most often present with symptoms of congestive heart failure and or symptoms related to their irregular heart rhythm Symptoms of congestive heart failure can include shortness of breath ankle swelling fatigue and weight gain Symptoms of an irregular heart rhythm can include palpitations and chest discomfort The timecourse of TIC is most well studied in experiments on animals Researchers have found that animals began to exhibit abnormal changes in blood flow after just one day of an artificially generated fast heart rate designed to simulate a tachyarrythmia As their TIC progresses these animals will have worsening heart function e g reduced cardiac output and reduced ejection fraction for 3 5 weeks The worsened heart function then persists at a stable state until the heart rate is returned to normal With normal heart rates these animals begin to demonstrate improving heart function at 1 2 days and even complete recovery of ejection fraction at 1 month Human studies of the timecourse of TIC are not as robust as animal studies though current studies suggest that the majority of people with TIC will recover a significant degree of heart function over months to years
Symptoms of myocardial rupture are recurrent or persistent chest pain syncope and distension of jugular vein Sudden death caused by a myocardial rupture is sometimes preceded by no symptoms
Signs and symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum may include Severe sunburn when exposed to only small amounts of sunlight These often occur during a childs first exposure to sunlight Development of many freckles at an early age Rough surfaced growths solar keratoses and skin cancers Eyes that are painfully sensitive to the sun and may easily become irritated bloodshot and clouded Blistering or freckling on minimum sun exposure Telangiectasia spider veins Limited growth of hair on chest and legs Scaly skin Xeroderma dry skin Irregular dark spots on the skin Corneal ulcerations
Perianal cellulitis manifests as multiple symptoms that are inconsistent with a systemic disease The most notable feature is a very distinct redness around the anus and other signs of inflammation which can include swelling and itching at the site Other associated symptoms with perianal cellulitis include pain when defecating and bleeding These symptoms can often be confused with other skin conditions such as diaper rash eczema psoriasis hemorrhoids and more These symptoms can cause extreme discomfort especially in diaper wearing infants and serious complications can arise if left untreated In about 10 of cases balanitis or vulvovaginitis can develop concomitantly In even rarer instances tonsillopharyngitis can develop concomitantly as well Complications most often occur when perianal cellulitis remains undiagnosed and untreated for an extended period of time In cases where perianal cellulitis is left untreated it can cause more serious symptoms such as abscess formation and rheumatic fever Additionally untreated perianal cellulitis poses a risk of transmission to other people such as caretakers or family members Perianal cellulitis can also cause post streptococcal nephritis which should be monitored with urinalysis to assess kidney function

As Cowdens disease is a multi system disorder the physical manifestations are broken down by organ system Skin Adolescent patients affected with Cowden syndrome develop characteristic lesions called trichilemmomas which typically develop on the face and verrucous papules around the mouth and on the ears Oral papillomas are also common Furthermore shiny palmar keratoses with central dells are also present At birth or in childhood classic features of Cowdens include pigmented genital lesions lipomas epidermal nevi and cafe au lait spots Squamous cell carcinomas of the skin may also occur Thyroid Two thirds of patients have thyroid disorders and these typically include benign follicular adenomas or multinodular goiter of the thyroid Additionally Cowdens patients are more susceptible to developing thyroid cancer than the general population It is estimated that less than 10 percent of individuals with Cowden syndrome may develop follicular thyroid cancer Cases of papillary thyroid cancer have been reported as well Female and Male Genitourinary Females have an elevated risk of developing endometrial cancers which is highest for those under the age of 50 Currently it is not clear whether uterine leiomyomata fibroids or congenital genitourinary abnormalities occur at an increased rate in Cowden syndrome patients as compared to the general population The occurrence of multiple testicular lipomas or testicular lipomatosis is a characteristic finding in male patients with Cowden syndrome Gastrointestinal Polyps are extremely common as they are found in about 95 of Cowden syndrome patients undergoing a colonoscopy They are numerous ranging from a few to hundreds usually of the hamartomatous subtype and distributed across the colon as well as other areas within the gastrointestinal tract Other types of polyps that may be encountered less frequently include ganglioneuromatous adenomatous and lymphoid polyps Diffuse glycogenic acanthosis of the esophagus is another gastrointestinal manifestation associated with Cowden syndrome Breast Females are at an increased risk of developing breast cancer which is the most common malignancy observed in Cowdens patients Although some cases have been reported there is not enough evidence to indicate an association between Cowden syndrome and the development of male breast cancer Up to 75 demonstrate benign breast conditions such as intraductal papillomatosis fibroadenomas and fibrocystic changes However there is currently not enough evidence to determine if benign breast disease occurs more frequently in Cowdens patients as compared to individuals without a hereditary cancer syndrome Central Nervous System Macrocephaly is observed in 84 of patients with Cowden syndrome It typically occurs due to an abnormally enlarged brain or megalencephaly Patients may also exhibit dolichocephaly Varying degrees of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability have been reported as well Lhermitte Duclos disease is a benign cerebellar tumor that typically does not manifest until adulthood in patients with Cowden syndrome
Adult patients may present with worsening musculoskeletal symptoms muscle weakness myalgias bone pains and fatigue which are followed by recurrent fractures Children present with difficulty in walking stunted growth and deformities of the skeleton features of rickets There can also be a significant delay between the beginning of symptoms to diagnosis which research reflects as being between 2 5 to 28 years
Signs and symptoms vary depending on the type of cataract though considerable overlap occurs People with nuclear sclerotic or brunescent cataracts often notice a reduction of vision Nuclear cataracts typically cause greater impairment of distance vision than of near vision Those with posterior subcapsular cataracts usually complain of glare as their major symptom The severity of cataract formation assuming no other eye disease is present is judged primarily by a visual acuity test Other symptoms include frequent changes of glasses and colored halos due to hydration of lens Congenital cataracts can result in amblyopia if not treated in a timely manner
Clinically patients affected with HCP present similarly to those with other acute porphyrias such as acute intermittent porphyria AIP and variegate porphyria VP Patients with HCP and VP can present with symptoms shared between the acute and cutaneous porphyrias This includes the acute attacks of abdominal pain nausea vomiting diarrhea tachycardia hypertension and seizures as well as the cutaneous findings seen in porphyria cutanea tarda PCT namely increased skin fragility bullous lesions after exposure to sunlight and increased scarring Individuals with HCP may be asymptomatic in the absence of triggering factors Common triggers include certain drugs alcohol hormonal changes and dietary changes Sunlight and other ultraviolet light can trigger the skin manifestations Homozygous individuals for CPOX mutations can present with these findings at an earlier age than heterozygotes
The hallmarks of dehydration include thirst and neurological changes such as headaches general discomfort loss of appetite decreased urine volume unless polyuria is the cause of dehydration confusion unexplained tiredness purple fingernails and seizures The symptoms of dehydration become increasingly severe with greater total body water loss A body water loss of 1 2 considered mild dehydration is shown to impair cognitive performance While in people over age 50 the bodys thirst sensation diminishes with age a study found that there was no difference in fluid intake between young and old people Many older people have symptoms of dehydration Dehydration contributes to morbidity in the elderly population especially during conditions that promote insensible free water losses such as hot weather A Cochrane review on this subject defined water loss dehydration as people with serum osmolality of 295 mOsm kg or more and found that the main symptom in the elderly people aged over 65 was fatigue
Sturge Weber syndrome is usually manifested at birth by a port wine stain on the forehead and upper eyelid of one side of the face or the whole face The birthmark can vary in color from light pink to deep purple and is caused by an overabundance of capillaries around the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve just under the surface of the face There is also malformation of blood vessels in the pia mater overlying the brain on the same side of the head as the birthmark This causes calcification of tissue and loss of nerve cells in the cerebral cortex Neurological signs include seizures that begin in infancy and may worsen with age Convulsions usually happen on the side of the body opposite the birthmark and vary in severity There may also be muscle weakness on the side of the body opposite the birthmark Some children will have developmental delays and cognitive delays about 50 will have glaucoma optic neuropathy often associated with increased intraocular pressure which can be present at birth or develop later Glaucoma can be expressed as leukocoria which should suggest further evaluation for retinoblastoma Increased pressure within the eye can cause the eyeball to enlarge and bulge out of its socket buphthalmos Sturge Weber syndrome rarely affects other body organs
Cystic hygromas are increasingly diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography A common sign is a neck growth It may be found at birth or discovered later in an infant after an upper respiratory tract infection Cystic hygromas can grow very large and may affect breathing and swallowing Some symptoms may include a mass or lump in the mouth neck cheek or tongue It feels like a large fluid filled sac In addition cystic hygromas can be found in other body parts such as the arms chest legs groin and buttocks Cystic hygromas are also often seen in Turners syndrome although a patient who does not have the syndrome can present with this condition
The kidney is the organ most frequently affected Proteinuria the presence of protein in the urine is characteristic More than 90 of people with LCDD develop kidney failure often with rapid progression of disease Light chains may be deposited in many other organs and may or may not result in any symptoms Other than the kidneys liver and heart are the most commonly involved organs Deposition of light chains in the liver may lead to hepatomegaly an enlarged liver or rarely portal hypertension or liver failure The heart is affected in up to 80 of patients with LCDD and may cause arrhythmias and congestive heart failure
They have been described as masses that fall between a hemangioma and angiosarcoma They are vascular tumors that commonly present with an enlarging mass and most commonly involve the lungs liver and musculoskeletal system although many other body sites have been reported including the head and neck intestines lymph nodes pleura retroperitoneum heel stomach
The forefront indication that a depressive episode is manifesting is the sudden loss of energy or motivation in daily routines When this occurs it is not uncommon for individuals to seek medical attention with excessive worrying or anxiety that a more severe physiological disease may be the underlying issue However without an actual disease present this neurotic thinking often results in severe anxiety sleep disturbance and mood swings which may hinder social relationships Individuals with endogenous depression may experience inconsistencies in symptom severity which is often the reason for delayed treatment If left untreated symptoms may progress to a major depressive episode
Although individuals with CPVT may not experience any symptoms the most commonly reported symptoms are blackouts or sudden loss of consciousness referred to as syncope These blackouts often occur during exercise or as a response to emotional stress situations in which chemical messengers known as catecholamines such as adrenaline are released within the body Blackouts may be misinterpreted as being caused by simple faints or epilepsy often leading to delays in reaching the correct diagnosis In a third of those affected the first manifestation of the disease may be cardiac arrest potentially leading to sudden death This can occur in very young children presenting as sudden infant death syndrome or cot death Approximately 30 of those with CPVT will have a family member who has experienced blackouts seizures or sudden death in response to exercise or stress In those with CPVT catecholamine release can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm or arrhythmia known as ventricular tachycardia The ventricular tachycardia may take a characteristic form known as bidirectional ventricular tachycardia This form of ventricular tachycardia occurs relatively infrequently but if seen is suggestive of an underlying diagnosis of CPVT or the related condition Andersen Tawil syndrome These ventricular arrhythmias in some cases terminate by themselves causing a blackout from which the person then recovers However if the abnormal heart rhythm continues it can degenerate into a more dangerous arrhythmia known as ventricular fibrillation causing a cardiac arrest and if untreated sudden death There are typically very few abnormal signs on clinical examination in persons with CPVT However those with CPVT may develop a less serious heart rhythm disturbance called atrial fibrillation which can be detected on examination as an irregular pulse Furthermore approximately 20 of those with CPVT have a slow resting heart rate known as a sinus bradycardia
Physical Individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome grades 6 and 7 on the Quigley scale are born phenotypically female without any signs of genital masculinization despite having a 46 XY karyotype Symptoms of CAIS do not appear until puberty which may be slightly delayed but is otherwise normal except for absent menses and diminished or absent secondary terminal hair Axillary hair i e armpit hair fails to develop in one third of all cases External genitalia is normal although the labia and clitoris are sometimes underdeveloped Vaginal depth varies widely for CAIS women but is typically shorter than unaffected women one study of eight women with CAIS measured the average vaginal depth to be 5 9 cm vs 11 1 1 0 cm for unaffected women In some extreme cases the vagina has been reported to be aplastic resembling a dimple though the exact incidence of this is unknown The gonads in these women are not ovaries but instead are testes during the embryonic stage of development testes form in an androgen independent process that occurs due to the influence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome They may be located intra abdominally at the internal inguinal ring or may herniate into the labia majora often leading to the discovery of the condition Testes in affected women have been found to be atrophic upon gonadectomy Testosterone produced by the testes cannot be directly used due to the mutant androgen receptor that characterizes CAIS instead it is aromatized into estrogen which effectively feminizes the body and accounts for the normal female phenotype observed in CAIS However up to 5 of individuals with CAIS do not have an AR mutation The receptor in question is encoded by the AR gene located on the X chromosome at Xq11 12 At least 15 different mutations were known in 2003 and they are all recessive which makes the disease to follow X linked recessive inheritance Immature sperm cells in the testes do not mature past an early stage as sensitivity to androgens is required in order for spermatogenesis to complete Germ cell malignancy risk once thought to be relatively high is now thought to be approximately 2 Wolffian structures the epididymides vasa deferentia and seminal vesicles are typically absent but will develop at least partially in approximately 30 of cases depending on which mutation is causing the CAIS The prostate like the external male genitalia cannot masculinize in the absence of androgen receptor function and thus remains in the female form The Müllerian system the fallopian tubes uterus and upper portion of the vagina typically regresses due to the presence of anti Müllerian hormone originating from the Sertoli cells of the testes These women are thus born without fallopian tubes a cervix or a uterus and the vagina ends blindly in a pouch Müllerian regression does not fully complete in approximately one third of all cases resulting in Müllerian remnants Although rare a few cases of women with CAIS and fully developed Müllerian structures have been reported In one exceptional case a 22 year old with CAIS was found to have a normal cervix uterus and fallopian tubes In an unrelated case a fully developed uterus was found in a 22 year old adult with CAIS Other subtle differences that have been reported include slightly longer limbs and larger hands and feet due to a proportionally greater stature than unaffected women larger teeth minimal or no acne well developed breasts and a greater incidence of meibomian gland dysfunction i e dry eye syndromes and light sensitivity
The signs and symptoms of this condition are consistent with the following possible complications include aortic stenosis and hearing loss
Limited normal functions and movements are caused by osteochondromas growing slowly and inwardly The majority of osteochondromas are symptomless and are found incidentally Each individual with osteochondroma may experience symptoms differently and most of the time individuals will experience no symptoms at all Some of the most common symptoms are a hard immobile painless palpable mass adjacent muscle soreness and pressure or irritation with heavy exercising Major symptoms arise when complications such as fractures bone deformity or mechanical joint problems occur If the occurrence of an osteochondroma is near a nerve or a blood vessel the affected limb can experience numbness weakness loss of pulse or color change Periodic changes in the blood flow can also take place Approximately 20 of patients experiencing nerve compression commonly acknowledge vascular compression arterial thrombosis aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm Formation of pseudoaneurysm and venous thrombosis lead to claudication pain acute ischemia and symptoms of phlebitis If the tumor is found under a tendon it can cause pain during movement causing restriction of joint motion Pain can also occur due to bursal inflammation swelling or fracture at the base of the tumor stalk Some of the clinical signs and symptoms of malignant osteochondroma are pain swelling and mass enlargement
Because many organs can be affected by myeloma the symptoms and signs vary greatly Fatigue and bone pain are the most common symptoms at presentation The CRAB criteria encompass the most common signs of multiple myeloma 651 Calcium serum calcium 0 25 mmol L 1 mg dL higher than the upper limit of normal or 2 75 mmol L 11 mg dL Renal insufficiency creatinine clearance 40 mL per minute or serum creatinine 1 77 mol L 2 mg dL Anemia hemoglobin value of 2g dL below the lowest limit of normal or a hemoglobin value 10g dL Bone lesions osteolytic lesions on skeletal radiography CT or PET CT
The signs and symptoms associated with myocarditis are varied and relate either to the actual inflammation of the myocardium or to the weakness and dysfunction of the heart muscle that is secondary to the inflammation While myocarditis may develop over periods ranging from hours to months patients typically present with signs and symptoms that resemble heart failure including the following Since myocarditis is often due to a viral illness many patients experience symptoms consistent with a recent viral infection including a fever rash loss of appetite abdominal pain vomiting diarrhea joint pains and easily becoming tired Additionally myocarditis is often associated with pericarditis and many people with myocarditis present with signs and symptoms that suggest myocarditis and pericarditis at the same time Children primarily present with the aforementioned symptoms associated with a viral infection Since they overlap with many other illnesses this can make it more challenging to diagnose myocarditis in younger patients Later stages of the illness can involve the respiratory system and lead to increased work of breathing These are often mistaken for asthma Myocarditis can be distinguished as either fulminant or acute based on the severity of symptoms on presentation as well as the time course over which symptoms develop and persist This categorization can help predict the treatment outcomes and complications of myocarditis Fulminant myocarditis is defined as sudden and severe myocarditis that is associated with signs and symptoms of heart failure while at rest More specifically fulminant myocarditis is characterized by a distinct rapid onset of severe heart failure symptoms such as shortness of breath and chest pain that develop over the course of hours to days Additionally treatment requires the use of medications or mechanical devices to improve heart function Acute non fulminant myocarditis has a less distinct onset in contrast to fulminant myocarditis and evolves over days to months While the symptoms of acute myocarditis overlap with those of fulminant myocarditis they do not typically occur at rest and treatment does not require the use of mechanical circulatory support
Risks of retained placenta include hemorrhage and infection After the placenta is delivered the uterus should contract down to close off all the blood vessels inside the uterus If the placenta only partially separates the uterus cannot contract properly so the blood vessels inside will continue to bleed A retained placenta thereby leads to hemorrhage
Symptoms of viral pneumonia include fever non productive cough runny nose and systemic symptoms e g myalgia headache Different viruses cause different symptoms
Abdominal pain The main manifestations of peritonitis are acute abdominal pain abdominal tenderness abdominal guarding rigidity which are exacerbated by moving the peritoneum e g coughing forced cough may be used as a test flexing ones hips or eliciting the Blumberg sign meaning that pressing a hand on the abdomen elicits less pain than releasing the hand abruptly which will aggravate the pain as the peritoneum snaps back into place Rigidity is highly specific for diagnosing peritonitis specificity 76 100 The presence of these signs in a person is sometimes referred to as peritonism The localization of these manifestations depends on whether peritonitis is localized e g appendicitis or diverticulitis before perforation or generalized to the whole abdomen In either case pain typically starts as a generalized abdominal pain with involvement of poorly localizing visceral innervation of the visceral peritoneal layer and may become localized later with involvement of the somatic innervation of the parietal peritoneal layer Peritonitis is an example of an acute abdomen
The groove begins on the lower and internal side of the base of the fifth toe usually according to the plantar digital fold The groove becomes gradually deeper and more circular The rate of spread is variable and the disease may progress to a full circle in a few months or still be incomplete after years In about 75 percent of cases both feet are affected though not usually to the same degree There is no case reported where it begins in any other toe than the fifth while there is occasionally a groove on the fourth or third toe The distal part of the toe swells and appears like a small potato The swelling is due to lymphatic edema distal to the constriction After a time crusts can appear in the groove which can be infected with staphylococcus While the groove becomes deeper compression of tendons vessels and nerves occurs Bone is absorbed by pressure without any evidence of infection After a certain time all structures distal the stricture are reduced to an avascular cord The toe s connection to the foot becomes increasingly slender and if it is not amputated it spontaneously drops off without any bleeding Normally it takes about five years for an autoamputation to occur Cole describes four stages of ainhum
The condition is relatively rare It usually presents in young and otherwise healthy patients and also occurs more often in males than females The syndrome also became known as effort induced thrombosis in the 1960s as it has been reported to occur after vigorous activity though it can also occur due to anatomic abnormality such as clavicle impingement or spontaneously It may develop as a sequela of thoracic outlet syndrome It is differentiated from secondary causes of upper extremity thrombosis caused by intravascular catheters Paget Schroetter syndrome was described once for a viola player who suddenly increased practice time 10 fold creating enough repetitive pressure against the brachiocephalic and external jugular veins to cause thrombosis Symptoms may include sudden onset of pain warmth redness blueness and swelling in the arm Diagnosis is usually confirmed with an ultrasound These DVTs have the potential to cause a pulmonary embolism
Individuals with an alcohol use disorder will often complain of difficulty with interpersonal relationships problems at work or school and legal problems Additionally people may complain of irritability and insomnia Alcohol abuse is also an important cause of chronic fatigue Signs of alcohol abuse are related to alcohols effects on organ systems However while these findings are often present they are not necessary to make a diagnosis of alcohol abuse Signs of alcohol abuse show its drastic effects on the central nervous system including inebriation and poor judgment chronic anxiety irritability and insomnia Alcohols effects on the liver include elevated liver function tests classically AST is at least twice as high as ALT Prolonged use leads to cirrhosis and liver failure With cirrhosis patients develop an inability to process hormones and toxins The skin of a patient with alcoholic cirrhosis can feature spider angiomas palmar erythema and in acute liver failure jaundice and ascites The derangements of the endocrine system lead to the enlargement of the male breasts The inability to process toxins leads to liver disease such as hepatic encephalopathy Alcohol abuse can result in brain damage which causes impairments in executive functioning such as impairments to working memory and visuospatial function and can cause an abnormal personality as well as affective disorders to develop Binge drinking is associated with individuals reporting fair to poor health compared to non binge drinking individuals and which may progressively worsen over time Alcohol also causes impairment in a persons critical thinking A persons ability to reason in stressful situations is compromised and they seem very inattentive to what is going on around them Social skills are significantly impaired in people who have alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain The prefrontal cortex is responsible for cognitive functions such as working memory impulse control and decision making This region of the brain is vulnerable to chronic alcohol induced oxidative DNA damage The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions difficulty with perceiving vocal emotions and theory of mind deficits the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers Adolescent binge drinkers are most sensitive to damaging neurocognitive functions especially executive functions and memory People who abuse alcohol are less likely to survive critical illness with a higher risk for having sepsis and were more likely to die during hospitalization A smaller volume of consumed alcohol has a greater impact on the older adult than it does on a younger individual As a result the American Geriatrics Society recommends for an older adult with no known risk factors less than one drink a day or fewer than two drinks per occasion regardless of gender
The condition manifests itself as attacks lasting from a few minutes to several hours Episodes only happen when the individual is awake and they remain conscious throughout the attack Symptoms are most severe in youth and lessen with age Sufferers can have multiple attacks on a daily basis or may have periods of weeks or months between attacks Symptoms experienced during attacks can vary and include dystonia chorea athetosis ballismus or a combination
Generally the areas affected are exposed skin not usually protected by clothing however it can also occur in areas covered by clothing Areas constantly subjected to the suns rays may only be slightly affected if at all People with extreme cases will also have reactions to artificial light sources that emit a UV wavelength Parts of the body only thinly covered can also potentially be subjected to an outbreak Life with SU can be difficult Patients are subject to constant itching and pain as within minutes of the initial exposure to UV radiation a rash will appear The urticarial reaction begins in the form of pruritus later progressing to erythema and edema in the exposed areas of the skin If vast areas of the body are affected the loss of fluid into the skin could lead to light headedness headache nausea and vomiting Extremely rarely patients have been reported to experience an increase in heart rate that can cause a stroke or heart attack due to the body cavity swelling Other rare side effects can be bronchospasm and glucose instability issues Also if a large area of the body is suddenly exposed the person may be subject to an anaphylactic reaction Once free of exposure the rash will usually fade away within several hours rare and extreme cases can take a day or two to normalize depending on severity of the reaction
The main symptoms of paraphrenia are paranoid delusions and hallucinations The delusions often involve the individual being the subject of persecution although they can also be erotic hypochondriacal or grandiose in nature The majority of hallucinations associated with paraphrenia are auditory with 75 of patients reporting such an experience however visual tactile and olfactory hallucinations have also been reported The paranoia and hallucinations can combine in the form of threatening or accusatory voices coming from neighbouring houses and are frequently reported by the patients as disturbing and undeserved Patients also present with a lack of symptoms commonly found in other mental disorders similar to paraphrenia There is no significant deterioration of intellect personality or habits and patients often remain clean and mostly self sufficient Patients also remain oriented well in time and space Paraphrenia is different from schizophrenia because while both disorders result in delusions and hallucinations individuals with schizophrenia exhibit changes and deterioration of personality whereas individuals with paraphrenia maintain a well preserved personality and affective response
Propionic acidemia is characterized almost immediately in newborns Symptoms include poor feeding vomiting dehydration acidosis low muscle tone hypotonia seizures and lethargy The effects of propionic acidemia quickly become life threatening Long term complications can include chronic kidney disease cardiomyopathy and prolonged QTc interval
The signs and symptoms of carotid artery dissection may be divided into ischemic and non ischemic categories Non ischemic signs and symptoms
The annulus of the valve is still in the normal position The valve leaflets however are to a varying degree attached to the walls and septum of the right ventricle A subsequent atrialization of a portion of the morphologic right ventricle which is then contiguous with the right atrium is seen This causes the right atrium to be large and the anatomic right ventricle to be small in size S3 heart sound S4 heart sound Triple or quadruple gallop due to widely split S1 and S2 sounds plus a loud S3 and or S4 Systolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation Holosystolic or early systolic murmur along the lower left sternal border depending on the severity of the regurgitation Right atrial hypertrophy Right ventricular conduction defects Wolff Parkinson White syndrome often accompanies
Presentation may be subtle people with mild contusion may have no symptoms at all However pulmonary contusion is frequently associated with signs objective indications and symptoms subjective states including those indicative of the lung injury itself and of accompanying injuries Because gas exchange is impaired signs of low blood oxygen saturation such as low concentrations of oxygen in arterial blood gas and cyanosis bluish color of the skin and mucous membranes are commonly associated Dyspnea painful breathing or difficulty breathing is commonly seen and tolerance for exercise may be lowered Rapid breathing and a rapid heart rate are other signs With more severe contusions breath sounds heard through a stethoscope may be decreased or rales an abnormal crackling sound in the chest accompanying breathing may be present People with severe contusions may have bronchorrhea the production of watery sputum Wheezing and coughing are other signs Coughing up blood or bloody sputum is present in up to half of cases Cardiac output the volume of blood pumped by the heart may be reduced and hypotension low blood pressure is frequently present The area of the chest wall near the contusion may be tender or painful due to associated chest wall injury Signs and symptoms take time to develop and as many as half of cases are asymptomatic at the initial presentation The more severe the injury the more quickly symptoms become apparent In severe cases symptoms may occur as quickly as three or four hours after the trauma Hypoxemia low oxygen concentration in the arterial blood typically becomes progressively worse over 24 48 hours after injury In general pulmonary contusion tends to worsen slowly over a few days but it may also cause rapid deterioration or death if untreated
The main symptoms of dandruff are an itchy scalp and flakiness Red and greasy patches of skin and a tingly feeling on the skin are also symptoms
Fear discomfort or anxiety may be triggered both by the presence and the anticipation of the specific object or situation The main behavioral sign of a specific phobia is avoidance The fear or anxiety associated with specific phobia can also manifest in physical symptoms such as an increased heart rate shortness of breath muscle tension sweating or a desire to escape the situation
The main sign of blue baby syndrome is cyanosis Depending on the underlying cause of the cyanosis additional symptoms may be Rapid heartbeat Rapid respiratory rate Failure to thrive Shortness of breath Nasal flaring Lethargy Seizures
Because collagen plays an important role in the development of the body people with Kniest Dysplasia will typically have their first symptoms at birth These symptoms can include Musculoskeletal Problems Short limbs Shortened body trunk Flattened bones in the spine platyspondyly kyphoscoliosis Scoliosis Lateral curvature of the spine Early development of arthritis Respiratory problems Respiratory tract infection Difficulty breathing Eye problems Severe myopia near sightedness Cataract cloudiness in the lens of the eye Cranial structure may elongate the eyeball causing a thinning of the retina thereby predisposing retinal detachment Hearing problems progressive hearing loss ear infectionsMost symptoms are chronic and will continue to worsen as the individual ages It is essential to have regular checkups with general doctors orthopedist ophthalmologists and or otorhinolaryngologists This will help to detect whether there are any changes that could cause concern
Increased sensitivity to stimuli specifically hot and cold is a common symptom of pulpitis A prolonged throbbing pain may be associated with the disease However pulpitis can also occur without any pain Reversible pulpitis is characterised by intermittent brief discomfort initiated by a hot cold or sweet stimulus The pain evoked is of short duration and there is no lingering or spontaneous pain The pain ceases within a short period after removal of the stimulus With a reversible pulpitis sleep is usually not affected and no analgesics are necessary Usually no atypical change is evident on the radiograph Pulp vitality tests are positive and it is possible to preserve a healthy vital pulp Irreversible pulpitis in contrast is characterised by a constant severe pain that arises without provocation Characteristics may include sharp pain upon thermal stimulus lingering thermal pain spontaneity and referred pain Sometimes the pain may be accentuated by postural changes such as lying down or bending over If a stimulus is applied the pain persists for minutes or hours after removal of the stimulus These indicate that the vital inflamed pulp is not capable of healing and it is often indicated for the pulp to be removed as it is too damaged Sleep may be disturbed and over the counter painkillers are often taken in an attempt to provide relief but are usually ineffective
The primary symptom is hip pain especially hip pain on the outer lateral side of the joint This pain may appear when the affected person is walking or lying down on that side
Mallory Weiss Syndrome often presents as an episode of vomiting up blood hematemesis after violent retching or vomiting but may also be noticed as old blood in the stool melena and a history of retching may be absent In most cases the bleeding stops spontaneously after 24 48 hours but endoscopic or surgical treatment is sometimes required The condition is rarely fatal
The disease in the lungs is characterized by enlargement of the tracheobronchial lymph nodes and infiltration of the lungs sometimes leading to lung lobe consolidation and pleural effusion Signs and symptoms include cough loss of appetite weight loss anemia and difficulty breathing Seizures and rear limb weakness can be seen Invasion of the bone marrow can cause pancytopenia Diagnosis requires a biopsy
While the number and severity of symptoms vary among individuals repetitive regurgitation of undigested food known as rumination after the start of a meal is always present In some individuals the regurgitation is small occurring over a long period of time following ingestion and can be rechewed and swallowed In others the amount can be bilious and short lasting and must be expelled While some only experience symptoms following some meals most experience episodes following any ingestion from a single bite to a large meal However some long term patients will find a select couple of food or drink items that do not trigger a response Unlike typical vomiting regurgitation is typically described as effortless and unforced There is seldom nausea preceding the expulsion and the undigested food lacks the bitter taste and odour of stomach acid and bile Symptoms can begin to manifest at any point from the ingestion of the meal to 120 minutes thereafter However the more common range is between 30 seconds to 1 hour after the completion of a meal Symptoms tend to cease when the ruminated contents become acidic Abdominal pain 38 1 lack of fecal production or constipation 21 1 nausea 17 0 diarrhea 8 2 bloating 4 1 and dental decay 3 4 are also described as common symptoms in day to day life These symptoms are not necessarily prevalent during regurgitation episodes and can happen at any time Weight loss is often observed 42 2 at an average loss of 9 6 kilograms and is more common in cases where the disorder has gone undiagnosed for a longer period of time though this may be expected of the nutrition deficiencies that often accompany the disorder as a consequence of its symptoms Depression has also been linked with rumination syndrome though its effects on rumination syndrome are unknown Acid erosion of the teeth can be a feature of rumination as can halitosis bad breath
Symptoms of gliomas depend on which part of the central nervous system is affected A brain glioma can cause headaches vomiting seizures and cranial nerve disorders as a result of increased intracranial pressure A glioma of the optic nerve can cause visual loss Spinal cord gliomas can cause pain weakness or numbness in the extremities Gliomas do not usually metastasize by the bloodstream but they can spread via the cerebrospinal fluid and cause drop metastases to the spinal cord Complex visual hallucinations have been described as a symptom of low grade glioma A child who has a subacute disorder of the central nervous system that produces cranial nerve abnormalities especially of cranial nerve VII and the lower bulbar nerves long tract signs unsteady gait secondary to spasticity and some behavioral changes is most likely to have a pontine glioma
Cracked nipples are classified as a breast disorder The nipple is not only the structure to deliver milk to the infant it also contains small sebaceous glands or Montgomery glands to lubricate the skin of the areola Cracked nipples are most often associated with breastfeeding and appear as cracks or small lacerations or breaks in the skin of the nipple In some instances an ulcer will form The nipple in a nursing mother is in regular contact with a nursing infant Cracked nipples are trauma to the nipple and can be quite painful Cracked nipples typically appear three to seven days after the birth If the nipples appears to be wedge shaped white and flattened this may indicate that the latch is not good and there is a potential of developing cracked nipples
Fever and a non specific skin eruption with reddening erythema and swelling oedema of the skin are the most common symptoms of NEH Patients usually present with the skin eruption 1 2 weeks after use of the cytotoxic drug Sometimes the skin eruption can be painful Skin eruptions can be located on the extremities trunk and face Severe lesions are rare and can mimic cellulitis Generalised lesions resembling erythema multiforme have been reported
It is characterised by skin that is loose hanging wrinkled and lacking in elasticity The loose skin can be either generalised or localised Biopsies have shown reduction and degeneration of dermal elastic fibres in the affected areas of skin The loose skin is often most noticeable on the face resulting in a prematurely aged appearance The affected areas of skin may be thickened and dark In addition the joints may be loose hypermobile because of lax ligaments and tendons When cutis laxa is severe it can also affect the internal organs The lungs heart supravalvular pulmonary stenosis intestines or arteries may be affected with a variety of severe impairments In some cases hernias and outpouching of the bladder can be observed Patients can also present with whites of the eyes that are blue
Individuals with TEC have a median age of presentation of 18 26 months however the disorder may occur in infants younger than 6 months and in children as old as age 10 years Because of the gradual onset of the anemia children are often healthier than expected from their low hemoglobin levels
Risk of cancer Lifetime risk and mean age at diagnosis for Lynch syndrome associated cancers
Most patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy have either a stable or improving course in the appearance of the gastropathy on endoscopy However according to retrospective data roughly one in seven patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy will develop bleeding either acute or chronic attributable to the gastropathy Patients with chronic bleeding will usually come to the attention of the medical system because of anemia The diagnosis of portal hypertensive gastropathy is usually made on endoscopy The usual appearance of portal hypertensive gastropathy on endoscopy is a mosaic like or reticular pattern in the mucosa Red spots may or may not be present The pattern is usually seen throughout the stomach A similar pattern can be seen with a related condition called gastric antral vascular ectasia GAVE or watermelon stomach However in GAVE the ectatic blood vessels are more commonly found in the antrum or lower part of the stomach
Dermatitis symptoms vary with all different forms of the condition Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms there are certain signs that are common for all of them including redness of the skin swelling itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring Also the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis whether on the neck wrist forearm thigh or ankle Although the location may vary the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin More rarely it may appear on the genital area such as the vulva or scrotum Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy Although the symptoms of atopic dermatitis vary from person to person the most common symptoms are dry itchy red skin Typical affected skin areas include the folds of the arms the back of the knees wrists face and hands Perioral dermatitis refers to a red bumpy rash around the mouth Dermatitis herpetiformis symptoms include itching stinging and a burning sensation Papules and vesicles are commonly present The small red bumps experienced in this type of dermatitis are usually about 1 cm in size red in color and may be found symmetrically grouped or distributed on the upper or lower back buttocks elbows knees neck shoulders and scalp The symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis on the other hand tend to appear gradually from dry or greasy scaling of the scalp dandruff to scaling of facial areas sometimes with itching but without hair loss In newborns the condition causes a thick and yellowish scalp rash often accompanied by a diaper rash In severe cases symptoms may appear along the hairline behind the ears on the eyebrows on the bridge of the nose around the nose on the chest and on the upper back
The most obvious symptom of macropsia is the presence of exceptionally enlarged objects throughout the visual field For example a young girl might see her sisters books as the same size as her sister Stemming from this symptom someone with macropsia may feel undersized in relation to his or her surrounding environment Patients with macropsia have also noted the cessation of auditory function prior to the onset of visual hallucination indicating possible seizure either before or after the hallucination A buzzing sound in the ears has also been reported immediately before macropsia development Some patients claim that symptoms may be eased if an attempt is made to physically touch the object which appears enormous in size It is important to note however that patients typically remain lucid and alert throughout episodes being able to recount specific details A person with macropsia may have no psychiatric conditions Symptoms caused chemically by drugs such as cannabis magic mushrooms or cocaine tend to dissipate after the chemical compound has been excreted from the body Those who acquire macropsia as a symptom of a virus usually experience complete recovery and restoration of normal vision Dysmetropsia in one eye a case of aniseikonia can present with symptoms such as headaches asthenopia reading difficulties depth perception problems or double vision The visual distortion can cause uncorrelated images to stimulate corresponding retinal regions simultaneously impairing fusion of the images Without suppression of one of the images symptoms from mild poor stereopsis binocular diplopia and intolerable rivalry can occur
The cardinal features of Rolandic epilepsy are infrequent often single focal seizures consisting of a unilateral facial sensorimotor symptoms 30 of patients b oropharyngolaryngeal manifestations 53 of patients c speech arrest 40 of patients and d hypersalivation 30 of patients Hemifacial sensorimotor seizures are often entirely localised in the lower lip or spread to the ipsilateral hand Motor manifestations are sudden continuous or bursts of clonic contractions usually lasting from a few seconds to a minute Ipsilateral tonic deviation of the mouth is also common Hemifacial sensory symptoms consist of unilateral numbness mainly in the corner of the mouth Hemifacial seizures are often associated with an inability to speak and hypersalivation The left side of my mouth felt numb and started jerking and pulling to the left and I could not speak to say what was happening to me Negative myoclonus can be observed in some cases as an interruption of tonic muscular activity Oropharyngolaryngeal ictal manifestations are unilateral sensorimotor symptoms inside the mouth Numbness and more commonly paraesthesias tingling prickling freezing are usually diffuse on one side or exceptionally may be highly localised even to one tooth Motor oropharyngolaryngeal symptoms produce strange sounds such as death rattle gargling grunting and guttural sounds and combinations In his sleep he was making guttural noises with his mouth pulled to the right as if he was chewing his tongue We heard her making strange noises like roaring and found her unresponsive head raised from the pillow eyes wide open rivers of saliva coming out of her mouth rigid Arrest of speech is a form of anarthria The child is unable to utter a single intelligible word and attempts to communicate with gestures My mouth opened and I could not speak I wanted to say I cannot speak At the same time it was as if somebody was strangling me Hypersalivation a prominent autonomic manifestation is often associated with hemifacial seizures oro pharyngo laryngeal symptoms and speech arrest Hypersalivation is not just frothing Suddenly my mouth is full of saliva it runs out like a river and I cannot speak Syncope like epileptic seizures may occur probably as a concurrent symptom of Panayiotopoulos syndrome She lies there unconscious with no movements no convulsions like a wax work no life Consciousness and recollection are fully retained in more than half 58 of Rolandic seizures I felt that air was forced into my mouth I could not speak and I could not close my mouth I could understand well everything said to me Other times I feel that there is food in my mouth and there is also a lot of salivation I cannot speak In the remainder 42 consciousness becomes impaired during the ictal progress and in one third there is no recollection of ictal events Progression to hemiconvulsions or generalised tonic clonic seizures occurs in around half of children and hemiconvulsions may be followed by postictal Todds hemiparesis Duration and circadian distribution Rolandic seizures are usually brief lasting for 1 3 minutes Three quarters of seizures occur during nonrapid eye movement sleep mainly at sleep onset or just before awakening Status epilepticus Although rare focal motor status or hemiconvulsive status epilepticus is more likely to occur than secondarily generalised convulsive status epilepticus which is exceptional Opercular status epilepticus usually occurs in children with atypical evolution or may be induced by carbamazepine or lamotrigine This state lasts for hours to months and consists of ongoing unilateral or bilateral contractions of the mouth tongue or eyelids positive or negative subtle perioral or other myoclonus dysarthria speech arrest difficulties in swallowing buccofacial apraxia and hypersalivation These are often associated with continuous spikes and waves on an EEG during NREM sleep Other seizure types Despite prominent hypersalivation focal seizures with primarily autonomic manifestations autonomic seizures are not considered part of the core clinical syndrome of Rolandic epilepsy However some children may present with independent autonomic seizures or seizures with mixed Rolandic autonomic manifestations including emesis as in Panayiotopoulos syndrome Atypical forms Rolandic epilepsy may present with atypical manifestations such early age at onset developmental delay or learning difficulties at inclusion other seizure types atypical EEG abnormalities These children usually have normal intelligence and development Learning can remain unimpaired while a child is afflicted with Rolandic epilepsy
Lactation mastitis usually affects only one breast and the symptoms can develop quickly It develops into three stages from the initial stage the pus formation stage to the restoration stage The signs and symptoms usually appear suddenly and they include
Besides the clicking snapping or triggering a characteristic Notta nodule is commonly found on the palmar side at the metacarpophalangeal MCP joint This nodule can be found by palpation Children can also present a thumb which they cannot extend actively due to entrapment of the nodule to the A1 pulley Some may even present with a fixed flexion deformity of the IPJ where no extension is possible
The signs and symptoms of brain tumors are broad People may experience symptoms regardless of whether the tumor is benign not cancerous or cancerous Primary and secondary brain tumors present with similar symptoms depending on the location size and rate of growth of the tumor For example larger tumors in the frontal lobe can cause changes in the ability to think However a smaller tumor in an area such as Wernickes area small area responsible for language comprehension can result in a greater loss of function
A hiccup consists of a single or a series of breathing diaphragm spasms of variable spacing and duration and a brief less than one half second unexpected shoulder abdomen throat or full body tremor Hiccups may present as an audible chirp squeak hupp or if controlled a quick inhaling gasp sigh or sniff They may also present as brief but distracting or painful interruptions in normal breathing with sudden momentary pain of the throat chest or abdomen
Pathophysiology LGL syndrome was originally thought to involve a rapidly conducting accessory pathway bundle of James that connects the atria directly to the bundle of His bypassing the slowly conducting atrioventricular node However the majority of those with LGL in whom electrophysiological studies have been performed do not have any evidence of an accessory pathway or structural abnormality Whilst in a minority of cases some form of intranodal or paranodal fibers that bypass all or part of the atrioventricular node can be found with subsequent conduction down the normal His Purkinje system in most cases the short PR interval is caused by accelerated conduction through the atrioventricular node LGL syndrome is therefore felt to represent a clinical syndrome with multiple different underlying causes
The way in which neonatal hypoglycemia symptoms may be presented is vague or hard to tell apart from other conditions The symptoms can be confused with
Hypoglycemia in early infancy can cause jitteriness lethargy unresponsiveness or seizures The most severe forms may cause macrosomia in utero producing a large birth weight often accompanied by abnormality of the pancreas Milder hypoglycemia in infancy causes hunger every few hours with increasing jitteriness or lethargy Milder forms have occasionally been detected by investigation of family members of infants with severe forms adults with the mildest degrees of congenital hyperinsulinism have a decreased tolerance for prolonged fasting Other presentations are Dizziness Intellectual disability Hypoglycemic coma CardiomegalyThe variable ages of presentations and courses suggest that some forms of congenital hyperinsulinism especially those involving abnormalities of KATP channel function can worsen or improve with time The potential harm from hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia depends on the severity and duration Children who have recurrent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in infancy can suffer harm to the brain
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy or hepatic lipidosis of pregnancy usually manifests in the third trimester of pregnancy but may occur any time in the second half of pregnancy or in the puerperium the period immediately after delivery On average the disease presents during the 35th or 36th week of pregnancy The usual symptoms in the mother are non specific including nausea vomiting anorexia or lack of desire to eat and abdominal pain excessive thirst may be the earliest symptom without overlap with otherwise considered normal pregnancy symptoms however jaundice and fever may occur in as many as 70 of patients In patients with more severe disease pre eclampsia may occur which involves elevation of blood pressure and accumulation of fluid termed oedema This may progress to involvement of additional systems including acute kidney failure hepatic encephalopathy and pancreatitis There have also been reports of diabetes insipidus complicating this condition Many laboratory abnormalities are seen in acute fatty liver of pregnancy Liver enzymes are elevated with the AST and ALT enzymes ranging from minimal elevation to 1000 IU L but usually staying in the 300 500 range Bilirubin is almost universally elevated Alkaline phosphatase is often elevated in pregnancy due to production from the placenta but may be additionally elevated Other abnormalities may include an elevated white blood cell count hypoglycemia elevated coagulation parameters including the international normalized ratio and decreased fibrinogen Frank disseminated intravascular coagulation or DIC may occur in as many as 70 of people Abdominal ultrasound may show fat deposition in the liver but as the hallmark of this condition is microvesicular steatosis see pathology below this is not seen on ultrasound Rarely the condition can be complicated by rupture or necrosis of the liver which may be identified by ultrasound
Blurring of vision due to pseudomyopia Headache Eye strain Asthenopia Trouble concentrating when reading
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis HP can be categorized as acute subacute and chronic based on the duration of the illness
Bruises often induce pain immediately after the trauma that results in their formation but small bruises are not normally dangerous alone Sometimes bruises can be serious leading to other more life threatening forms of hematoma such as when associated with serious injuries including fractures and more severe internal bleeding The likelihood and severity of bruising depends on many factors including type and healthiness of affected tissues Minor bruises may be easily recognized in people with light skin color by characteristic blue or purple appearance idiomatically described as black and blue in the days following the injury Hematomas can be subdivided by size By definition ecchymoses are 1 centimetres in size or larger and are therefore larger than petechiae less than 3 millimetres in diameter or purpura 3 to 10 millimetres in diameter Ecchymoses also have a more diffuse border than other purpura A broader definition of ecchymosis is the escape of blood into the tissues from ruptured blood vessels The term also applies to the subcutaneous discoloration resulting from seepage of blood within the injured tissue Bruise colors vary from red blue or almost black depending on the severity of broken capillaries or blood vessels within the bruise site Broken venules or arterioles often result in a deep blue or dark red bruise respectively Darker colored bruises may result from a more severe bleeding from both blood vessels Older bruises may appear yellow green or brown
Patients will present with a sudden onset of cramps abdominal pain or a stitch The pain localises in the area of the umbilicus and can radiate to the lumbar and surrounding regions
AON was first described in 1982 It presents with visual loss and signs of optic nerve dysfunction such as loss of color vision afferent pupil defect and sometimes abnormalities of the optic disc The clinical features of AON can be variable and present in several unilateral or bilateral forms
The signs and symptoms of this disorder typically appear in early childhood Almost all affected children have delayed development Additional signs and symptoms can include weak muscle tone hypotonia seizures diarrhea vomiting and low blood sugar hypoglycemia A heart condition called cardiomyopathy which weakens and enlarges the heart muscle is another common feature of malonyl CoA decarboxylase deficiency Some common symptoms in Malonyl CoA decarboxylase deficiency such as cardiomyopathy and metabolic acidosis are triggered by the high concentrations of Malonyl CoA in the cytoplasm High levels of Malonyl CoA will inhibit β oxidation of fatty acids through deactivating the carrier of fatty acyl group CPT1 and thus blocking fatty acids from going into the mitochondrial matrix for oxidation A research conducted in Netherlands has suggested that carnitine supplements and a low fat diet may help to reduce the level of malonic acid in our body
Complications Complications of blepharochalasis may include conjunctival hyperemia excessive blood flow through the moist tissues of the orbit chemosis entropion ectropion and ptosis
Infantile juvenile and adolescent forms of nephronophthisis have been identified Although the range of characterizations is broad people affected by nephronophthisis typically present with polyuria production of a large volume of urine polydipsia excessive liquid intake and after several months to years end stage kidney disease a condition necessitating either dialysis or a kidney transplant in order to survive Some individuals with nephronophthisis also have so called extra renal symptoms which can include tapetoretinal degeneration liver problems oculomotor apraxia and cone shaped epiphysis Saldino Mainzer syndrome
Symptoms of hypochondrogenesis include edema limb undergrowth spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia short ribs respiratory failure short chin upper limb undergrowth thoracic hypoplasia hypertelorism hydrops fetalis pulmonary hypoplasia and a cleft palate
Source severe headache visual loss due to papilledema vomiting bilateral Babinski sign drowsiness after several hours of the above symptoms gait change rotation of feet when walking impaction constipation back flexibility
The early prodromal symptoms in adolescents and adults are nausea loss of appetite aching muscles and headache This is followed by the characteristic rash or oral sores malaise and a low grade fever that signal the presence of the disease Oral manifestations of the disease enanthem not uncommonly may precede the external rash exanthem In children the illness is not usually preceded by prodromal symptoms and the first sign is the rash or the spots in the oral cavity The rash begins as small red dots on the face scalp torso upper arms and legs progressing over 10 12 hours to small bumps blisters and pustules followed by umbilication and the formation of scabs At the blister stage intense itching is usually present Blisters may also occur on the palms soles and genital area Commonly visible evidence of the disease develops in the oral cavity and tonsil areas in the form of small ulcers which can be painful or itchy or both this enanthem internal rash can precede the exanthem external rash by 1 to 3 days or can be concurrent These symptoms of chickenpox appear 10 to 21 days after exposure to a contagious person Adults may have a more widespread rash and longer fever and they are more likely to experience complications such as varicella pneumonia Because watery nasal discharge containing live virus usually precedes both exanthem external rash and enanthem oral ulcers by 1 to 2 days the infected person actually becomes contagious one to two days before recognition of the disease Contagiousness persists until all vesicular lesions have become dry crusts scabs which usually entails four or five days by which time nasal shedding of live virus ceases The condition usually resolves by itself within a week or two The rash may however last for up to one month Chickenpox is rarely fatal although it is generally more severe in adult men than in women or children Non immune pregnant women and those with a suppressed immune system are at highest risk of serious complications Arterial ischemic stroke AIS associated with chickenpox in the previous year accounts for nearly one third of childhood AIS The most common late complication of chickenpox is shingles herpes zoster caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus decades after the initial often childhood chickenpox infection
Trichotillomania is usually confined to one or two sites but can involve multiple sites The scalp is the most common pulling site followed by the eyebrows eyelashes face arms and legs Some less common areas include the pubic area underarms beard and chest The classic presentation is the Friar Tuck form of vertex and crown alopecia Children are less likely to pull from areas other than the scalp People with trichotillomania often pull only one hair at a time and these hair pulling episodes can last for hours at a time Trichotillomania can go into remission like states where the individual may not experience the urge to pull for days weeks months or even years Individuals with trichotillomania exhibit hair of differing lengths some are broken hairs with blunt ends some new growth with tapered ends some broken mid shaft or some uneven stubble Scaling on the scalp is not present overall hair density is normal and a hair pull test is negative the hair does not pull out easily Hair is often pulled out leaving an unusual shape Individuals with trichotillomania may be secretive or shameful of the hair pulling behavior An additional psychological effect can be low self esteem often associated with being shunned by peers and the fear of socializing due to appearance and negative attention they may receive Some people with trichotillomania wear hats wigs false eyelashes eyebrow pencil or style their hair in an effort to avoid such attention There seems to be a strong stress related component In low stress environments some exhibit no symptoms known as pulling whatsoever This pulling often resumes upon leaving this environment Some individuals with trichotillomania may feel they are the only person with this problem due to low rates of reporting For some people trichotillomania is a mild problem merely a frustration But for many embarrassment about hair pulling causes isolation and results in a great deal of emotional distress placing them at risk for a co occurring psychiatric disorder such as a mood or anxiety disorder Hair pulling can lead to tension and strained relationships with family members and friends Family members may need professional help in coping with this problem Other medical complications include infection permanent loss of hair repetitive stress injury carpal tunnel syndrome and gastrointestinal obstruction as a result of trichophagia In trichophagia people with trichotillomania also ingest the hair that they pull in extreme and rare cases this can lead to a hair ball trichobezoar Rapunzel syndrome an extreme form of trichobezoar in which the tail of the hair ball extends into the intestines can be fatal if misdiagnosed Environment is a large factor which affects hair pulling Sedentary activities such as being in a relaxed environment are conducive to hair pulling A common example of a sedentary activity promoting hair pulling is lying in a bed while trying to rest or fall asleep An extreme example of automatic trichotillomania is found when some patients have been observed to pull their hair out while asleep This is called sleep isolated trichotillomania
People with the spastic type of CP typically have muscles that are tight or stiff due to high muscle tone Symptoms of spastic cerebral palsy vary as the disability can affect individuals differently However they typically appear in infancy and early childhood and most children are diagnosed in the first two years of life The main indicator of spastic cerebral palsy is a delay in reaching motor milestones The following are some common early signs though the presence of a listed symptom does not definitively mean that a child has spastic CP Prior to 6 months
Typical features of acne include increased secretion of oily sebum by the skin microcomedones comedones papules nodules large papules pustules and often results in scarring The appearance of acne varies with skin color It may result in psychological and social problems
Signs vary from person to person Young children and babies lack movement and have a difficult time eating and breathing For young children not diagnosed immediately at birth these are usually the first visible symptoms One sign is a swollen face in disproportional areas Other examples in newborns include swaying and a difficulty in moving Other symptoms include feeble muscles in the neck and upper rib cage area In adults the most common symptom is respiratory problems Other symptoms in adults could range from mild to severe speech impediments It is common to be diagnosed with scoliosis in relations to nemaline myopathy As babies that have NM develop and become of age when they should start walking many take longer than average due to the lack of muscle or just muscle fatigue Since facial muscles are involved in NM takeover elongated faces and a lower mandible are often observed in people with NM People affected by NM usually will begin to feel muscle exhaustion between ages 20 50 NM is usually not progressive Gastroesophageal reflux although not common is associated with NM Heart abnormalities can occur as a result of NM but the likelihood of that happening are not high
85 90 of IgA deficient individuals are asymptomatic although the reason for lack of symptoms is relatively unknown and continues to be a topic of interest and controversy Some patients with IgA deficiency have a tendency to develop recurrent sinopulmonary infections gastrointestinal infections and disorders allergies autoimmune conditions and malignancies These infections are generally mild and would not usually lead to an in depth workup except when unusually frequent They rarely present with severe reactions including anaphylaxis to blood transfusions or intravenous immunoglobulin due to the presence of IgA in these blood products Patients have an increased susceptibility to pneumonia and recurrent episodes of other respiratory infections and a higher risk of developing autoimmune diseases in middle age IgA deficiency and common variable immunodeficiency CVID feature similar B cell differentiation arrests but it does not present the same lymphocyte subpopulation abnormalities IgA deficient patients may progress to panhypogammaglobulinemia characteristic of CVID Selective IgA and CVID are found in the same family
Symptoms include
Symptoms may include a change in skin color to red or black numbness pain skin breakdown and coolness The feet and hands are most commonly involved
Symptoms of bronchiectasis commonly include a cough productive of frequent green or yellow sputum lasting months to years Other common symptoms include difficulty breathing wheezing a whistling sound when you breathe and chest pain Exacerbations of symptoms may occur these exacerbations occur more frequently in advanced or severe disease Systemic symptoms including fevers chills night sweats fatigue and weight loss may be seen with bronchiectasis Bronchiectasis may also present with coughing up blood in the absence of sputum which has been called dry bronchiectasis Exacerbations in bronchiectasis present as a worsening of cough increasing sputum volume or thickened consistency lasting at least 48 hours worsening shortness of breath breathlessness worsening exercise intolerance increased fatigue or malaise and the development of hemoptysis People often report frequent bouts of bronchitis requiring therapy with repeated courses of antibiotics People with bronchiectasis may have bad breath from active infection On examination crepitations and expiratory rhonchi may be heard with auscultation Nail clubbing is a rare symptom The complications of bronchiectasis include serious health conditions such as respiratory failure and atelectasis collapse or closure of a lung Respiratory failure occurs when not enough oxygen passes from the lungs into the blood Atelectasis occur when one or more segments of the lungs collapse or do not inflate properly Other pulmonary complications include lung abscess and empyema Cardiovascular complications include cor pulmonale in which there is enlargement and failure of the right side of the heart as a result of disease of the lungs
Possible symptoms of Haemophilus meningitis include Nausea or vomiting Fever Headache Sensitivity to light Seizures Anorexia change in mental status such as irritability stiff neck
Most patients have symptoms in the first year of life It is rare for symptoms to be undetected until adulthood and usually adults have associated complications The classic triad of intermittent abdominal pain jaundice and a right upper quadrant abdominal mass is found only in minority of patients In infants choledochal cysts usually lead to obstruction of the bile ducts and retention of bile This leads to jaundice and an enlarged liver If the obstruction is not relieved permanent damage may occur to the liver scarring and cirrhosis with the signs of portal hypertension obstruction to the flow of blood through the liver and ascites fluid accumulation in the abdomen There is an increased risk of cancer in the wall of the cyst In older individuals choledochal cysts are more likely to cause abdominal pain and intermittent episodes of jaundice and occasionally cholangitis inflammation within the bile ducts caused by the spread of bacteria from the intestine into the bile ducts Inflammation of the pancreas also may occur The cause of these complications may be related to either abnormal flow of bile within the ducts or the presence of gallstones
Because CBD is progressive a standard set of diagnostic criteria can be used which is centered on the diseases evolution Included in these fundamental features are problems with cortical processing dysfunction of the basal ganglia and a sudden and detrimental onset Psychiatric and cognitive dysfunctions although present in CBD are much less prevalent and lack establishment as common indicators of the presence of the disease Although corticobasal degeneration has a plethora of symptoms some are more prevalent than others In a study of 147 patients with CBD it was found that all of them had at least one Parkinsonian sign 95 having two and 93 had some higher order dysfunction cognitive impairments like acalculia sensory loss dementia neglect etc In a separate study of 14 patients recorded 3 years after the onset of symptoms many patients had high numbers of motor symptoms 71 had bradykinesia slow movements 64 showed apraxia 43 reported limb dystonia and although more cognitive 36 had dementia In another study of 36 over half had a useless alien arm and 27 had a gait impediment 21 From this we can see why CBD is hard to diagnose Even if it can be distinguished as different from one of the other similar diseases the varying combinations of symptoms create a difficult path to diagnosis
At the beginning people show pin sized dots with white plaque on them which constantly grow into flat red areas hardly surrounded by white plaque Despite the visible symptoms patients in nearly all cases do not suffer from burning or itching nor does it smell strange Due to its analogy to a fungal skin infection balanitis circinata is often misdiagnosed as mycosis especially in cases where patients have no other symptoms of reactive arthritis
The signs and symptoms at an early stage are harder to be seen At first look acne mechanica seems very similar to any other type of acne However it differs in how it is caused A lot of acne has to do with hormones the amount of oil production in the skin and genetic predispositions Acne mechanica specifically refers to the skin irritation that is formed by excess pressure heat and rubbing against the skin When the skin is constantly rubbed it initially becomes rough and then starts to develop acne like bumps with continuing irritation like sweating or more friction If the skin continues to be irritated for a longer period of time a more serious acne lesion develops that grows in size and redness They appear as small red tender bumps called papules There may be a combination of whiteheads and blackheads that also appear around the area affected the difference being that whiteheads are closed and clogged pores whereas blackheads are also clogged but open pores The symptoms may vary also depending on a persons skin type overly oily or dry skin can cause a number of symptoms that heighten the possibility for acne mechanica to develop
Stage I Stage I called early onset typically begins between 6 and 18 months of age This stage is often overlooked because symptoms of the disorder may be somewhat vague and parents and doctors may not notice the subtle slowing of development at first The infant may begin to show less eye contact and have reduced interest in toys There may be delays in gross motor skills such as sitting or crawling Hand wringing and decreasing head growth may occur but not enough to draw attention This stage usually lasts for a few months but can continue for more than a year
Degenerative disc disease can result in lower back or upper neck pain The amount of degeneration does not correlate well with the amount of pain patients experience Many people experience no pain while others with the same amount of damage have severe chronic pain Whether a patient experiences pain or not largely depends on the location of the affected disc and the amount of pressure that is being put on the spinal column and surrounding nerve roots Nevertheless degenerative disc disease is one of the most common sources of back pain and affects approximately 30 million people every year With symptomatic degenerative disc disease the pain can vary depending on the location of the affected disc A degenerated disc in the lower back can result in lower back pain sometimes radiating to the hips as well as pain in the buttocks thighs or legs If pressure is being placed on the nerves by exposed nucleus pulposus sporadic tingling or weakness through the knees and legs can also occur A degenerated disc in the upper neck will often result in pain to the neck arm shoulders and hands tingling in the fingers may also be evident if nerve impingement is occurring Pain is most commonly felt or worsened by movements such as sitting bending lifting and twisting After an injury some discs become painful because of inflammation and the pain comes and goes Some people have nerve endings that penetrate more deeply into the anulus fibrosus outer layer of the disc than others making discs more likely to generate pain In the alternative the healing of trauma to the outer anulus fibrosus may result in the innervation of the scar tissue and pain impulses from the disc as these nerves become inflamed by nucleus pulposus material Degenerative disc disease can lead to a chronic debilitating condition and can have a serious negative impact on a persons quality of life When pain from degenerative disc disease is severe traditional nonoperative treatment may be ineffective
The signs and symptoms of this condition are thickened skin skin ulcer dyspareunia endocardium abnormality vision problems hepatitis seizures bloody urine and meningitis
Newborns with harlequin type ichthyosis present with thick fissured armor plate hyperkeratosis Sufferers feature severe cranial and facial deformities The ears may be very poorly developed or absent entirely as may the nose The eyelids may be everted ectropion which leaves the eyes and the area around them very susceptible to infection Babies with this condition often bleed during birth The lips are pulled back by the dry skin eclabium Joints are sometimes lacking in movement and may be below the normal size Hypoplasia is sometimes found in the fingers Polydactyly has also been found on occasion In addition the fish mouth appearance mouth breathing and xerostomia place affected individuals at extremely high risk for developing rampant dental decay Patients with this condition are extremely sensitive to changes in temperature due to their hard cracked skin which prevents normal heat loss The skin also restricts respiration which impedes the chest wall from expanding and drawing in enough air This can lead to hypoventilation and respiratory failure Patients are often dehydrated as their plated skin is not well suited to retaining water
Clinically affected people may not have symptoms or may complain of decreased visual acuity Ophthalmic examination may reveal signs of retinal vascular disease including cotton wool spots retinal bleeds microaneurysms perivascular sheathing capillary telangiectasis macular edema and disc edema Capillary non perfusion documented by fluorescein angiography is commonly present and extensive retinal ischemia can lead to neovascularization of the retina iris and disc Staging of radiation retinopathy has been proposed
When a seizure begins in the temporal lobe its effects depend on the precise location of its point of origin its locus In 1981 the ILAE recognized three types of seizures occurring in temporal lobe epilepsy The classification was based on EEG findings However as of 2017 the general classification of seizures has been revised The newer classification uses three key features where the seizures begin the level of awareness during a seizure and other features
Headache facial pain or pressure of a dull constant or aching sort over the affected sinuses is common with both acute and chronic stages of sinusitis This pain is usually localized to the involved sinus and may worsen when the affected person bends over or lies down Pain often starts on one side of the head and progresses to both sides Acute sinusitis may be accompanied by a thick nasal discharge that is usually green in color and may contain pus or blood Often a localized headache or toothache is present and these symptoms distinguish a sinus related headache from other types of headaches such as tension and migraine headaches Another way to distinguish between toothache and sinusitis is that the pain in sinusitis is usually worsened by tilting the head forward and with the Valsalva maneuver Other symptoms associated with acute rhinosinusitis include cough fatigue hyposmia anosmia and ear fullness or pressure Sinus infections can also cause middle ear problems due to the congestion of the nasal passages This can be demonstrated by dizziness a pressurized or heavy head or vibrating sensations in the head Postnasal drip is also a symptom of chronic rhinosinusitis Halitosis bad breath is often stated to be a symptom of chronic rhinosinusitis however gold standard breath analysis techniques have not been applied Theoretically several possible mechanisms of both objective and subjective halitosis may be involved A 2005 review suggested that most sinus headaches are migraines The confusion occurs in part because migraine involves activation of the trigeminal nerves which innervate both the sinus region and the meninges surrounding the brain As a result accurately determining the site from which the pain originates is difficult People with migraines do not typically have the thick nasal discharge that is a common symptom of a sinus infection Symptoms of chronic sinusitis may include nasal congestion facial pain headache night time coughing an increase in previously minor or controlled asthma symptoms general malaise thick green or yellow discharge feeling of facial fullness or tightness that may worsen when bending over dizziness aching teeth and bad breath Often chronic sinusitis can lead to anosmia the loss of the sense of smell
The deficiency in anchoring fibrils impairs the adherence between the epidermis and the underlying dermis The skin of DEB patients is thus highly susceptible to severe blistering Collagen VII is also associated with the epithelium of the esophageal lining and DEB patients may have chronic scarring webbing and obstruction of the esophagus Affected individuals are often severely malnourished due to trauma to the oral and esophageal mucosa and require feeding tubes for nutrition They also have iron deficiency anemia of uncertain origin which leads to chronic fatigue Open wounds on the skin heal slowly or not at all often scarring extensively and are particularly susceptible to infection Many individuals bathe in a bleach and water mixture to fight off these infections The chronic inflammation leads to errors in the DNA of the affected skin cells which in turn causes squamous cell carcinoma SCC The majority of these patients die before the age of 30 either of SCC or complications related to DEB The chronic inflammatory state seen in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa RDEB may cause small fiber peripheral neuropathy SFN RDEB patients have reported the sensation of pain in line with neuropathic pain qualities
Those with ocular ischemic syndrome are typically between the ages of 50 and 80 patients over 65 twice as many men as women are affected More than 90 of those presenting with the condition have vision loss Patients may report a dull radiating ache over the eye and eyebrow Those with ocular ischemic syndrome may also present with a history of other systemic diseases including arterial hypertension diabetes mellitus coronary artery disease previous stroke and hemodialysis The condition presents with visual loss secondary to hypoperfusion of the eye structures The patient presents with intractable pain or ocular angina On dilated examination there may be blot retinal hemorrhages along with dilated and beaded retinal veins The ocular perfusion pressure is decreased The corneal layers show edema and striae There is mild anterior uveitis A cherry red spot may be seen in the macula along with cotton wool spots elsewhere due to retinal nerve fiber layer hemorrhages The retinal arteries may show spontaneous pulsations
Symptoms may include
Boils are bumpy red pus filled lumps around a hair follicle that are tender warm and painful They range from pea sized to golf ball sized A yellow or white point at the center of the lump can be seen when the boil is ready to drain or discharge pus In a severe infection an individual may experience fever swollen lymph nodes and fatigue A recurring boil is called chronic furunculosis Skin infections tend to be recurrent in many patients and often spread to other family members Systemic factors that lower resistance commonly are detectable including diabetes obesity and hematologic disorders Boils can be caused by other skin conditions that cause the person to scratch and damage the skin Boils may appear on the buttocks or near the anus the back the neck the stomach the chest the arms or legs or even in the ear canal Boils may also appear around the eye where they are called styes A boil on the gum is called intraoral dental sinus or more commonly a gumboil
The signs of sepsis are non specific and include Body temperature changes Breathing problems Diarrhea Low blood sugar hypoglycemia Reduced movements Reduced sucking Seizures Bradycardia Swollen belly area Vomiting Yellow skin and whites of the eyes jaundice hemorrhagic rashA heart rate above 160 can also be an indicator of sepsis this tachycardia can present up to 24 hours before the onset of other signs
Symptoms of cardiomyopathies may include fatigue swelling of the lower extremities and shortness of breath after exertion Additional symptoms of the condition may include arrhythmia fainting and dizziness
Intellectual disability Flat feet Crossed eyes Severe postnatal growth retardation Nystagmus Narrow nose Short forearm bones Absent proximal radial epiphyses Autosomal recessive inheritance Dislocated radial head Sclerocornea has been reported in this condition
Complications The risk of serious complications from spinal fusion surgery for kyphosis is estimated to be 5 similar to the risks of surgery for scoliosis Possible complications include inflammation of the soft tissue or deep inflammatory processes breathing impairments bleeding and nerve injuries According to the latest evidence the actual rate of complications may be substantially higher Even among those who do not develop serious complications 5 of patients require reoperation within five years of the procedure and in general it is not yet clear what one would expect from spine surgery during the long term Given that the signs and symptoms of spinal deformity cannot be changed by surgical intervention surgery remains essentially a cosmetic choice However the cosmetic effects of surgery are not necessarily stable
Signs and symptoms include early satiety nausea vomiting extreme stabbing postprandial abdominal pain due to both the duodenal compression and the compensatory reversed peristalsis abdominal distention distortion burping external hypersensitivity or tenderness of the abdominal area reflux and heartburn In infants feeding difficulties and poor weight gain are also frequent symptoms In some cases of SMA syndrome severe malnutrition accompanying spontaneous wasting may occur This in turn increases the duodenal compression which worsens the underlying cause creating a cycle of worsening symptoms Fear of eating is commonly seen among those with the chronic form of SMA syndrome For many symptoms are partially relieved when in the left lateral decubitus or knee to chest position or in the prone face down position A Hayes maneuver which corresponds to applying pressure below the umbilicus in cephalad and dorsal direction elevates the root of the SMA also slightly easing the constriction Symptoms can be aggravated when leaning to the right or taking a face up position
In 90 of cases neonatal Bartter syndrome is seen between 24 and 30 weeks of gestation with excess amniotic fluid polyhydramnios After birth the infant is seen to urinate and drink excessively polyuria and polydipsia respectively Life threatening dehydration may result if the infant does not receive adequate fluids About 85 of infants dispose of excess amounts of calcium in the urine hypercalciuria and kidneys nephrocalcinosis which may lead to kidney stones In rare occasions the infant may progress to kidney failure Patients with classic Bartter syndrome may have symptoms in the first two years of life but they are usually diagnosed at school age or later Like infants with the neonatal subtype patients with classic Bartter syndrome also have polyuria polydipsia and a tendency to dehydration but normal or just slightly increased urinary calcium excretion without the tendency to develop kidney stones These patients also have vomiting and growth retardation Kidney function is also normal if the disease is treated but occasionally patients proceed to end stage kidney failure Bartter syndrome consists of low levels of potassium in the blood alkalosis normal to low blood pressures and elevated plasma renin and aldosterone Numerous causes of this syndrome probably exist Diagnostic pointers include high urinary potassium and chloride despite low serum values increased plasma renin hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus on kidney biopsy and careful exclusion of diuretic abuse Excess production of prostaglandins by the kidneys is often found Magnesium wasting may also occur Homozygous patients experience severe hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis
The symptoms of Gorhams disease vary depending on the bones involved It may affect any part of the skeleton but the most common sites of disease are the shoulder skull pelvic girdle jaw ribs and spine In some cases no symptoms are seen until a fracture occurs either spontaneously or following minor trauma such as a fall An acute onset of localized pain and swelling may occur More commonly pain of no apparent cause increases in frequency and intensity over time and may eventually be accompanied by weakness and noticeable deformity of the area The rate of progression is unpredictable and the prognosis can be difficult The disease may stabilize after a number of years go into spontaneous remission or in cases involving the chest and upper spine prove fatal Recurrence of the disease following remission can also occur Involvement of the spine and skull base may cause a poor outcome from neurological complications In many cases the result of Gorhams disease is severe deformity and functional disability Symptoms such as difficulty breathing and chest pain may be present if the disease is present in the ribs scapula or thoracic vertebrae These may indicate that the disease has spread from the bone into the chest cavity The breathing problems may be misdiagnosed as asthma because the damage done to the lungs can cause the same types of changes to lung function testing as seen in asthma Extension of the lesions into the chest may lead to the development of chylous pleural and pericardial effusions Chyle is rich in protein and white blood cells that are important in fighting infection The loss of chyle into the chest can have serious consequences including infection malnutrition and respiratory distress and failure These complications or their symptoms such as difficulty breathing chest pain poor growth or weight loss and infection have sometimes been the first indications of the condition
Synovitis causes joint tenderness or pain swelling and hard lumps called nodules When associated with rheumatoid arthritis swelling is a better indicator than tenderness
Symptoms in eosinophilic myocarditis are highly variable They tend to reflect the many underlying disorders causing eosinophil dysfunction as well as the widely differing progression rates of cardiac damage Before cardiac symptoms are detected some 66 of cases have symptoms of a common cold and 33 have symptoms of asthma rhinitis urticarial or other allergic disorder Cardiac manifestations of eosinophilic myocarditis range from none to life threatening conditions such as cardiogenic shock or sudden death due to abnormal heart rhythms More commonly the presenting cardiac symptoms of the disorder are the same as those seen in other forms of heart disease chest pain shortness of breath fatigue chest palpitations light headedness and syncope In its most extreme form however eosinophilic myocarditis can present as acute necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis i e with symptoms of chaotic and potentially lethal heart failure and heart arrhythmias This rarest form of the disorder reflects a rapidly progressive and extensive eosinophilic infiltration of the heart that is accompanied by massive myocardial cell necrosis Hypereosinophilia i e blood eosinophil counts at or above 1 500 per microliter or less commonly eosinophilia counts above 500 but below 1 500 per microliter are found in the vast majority of cases of eosinophilic myocarditis and are valuable clues that point to this rather than other types of myocarditis or myocardial injuries However elevated blood eosinophil counts may not occur during the early phase of the disorder Other less specific laboratory findings implicate a cardiac disorder but not necessarily eosinophilic myocarditis These include elevations in blood markers for systemic inflammation e g C reactive protein erythrocyte sedimentation rate elevations in blood markers for cardiac injury e g creatine kinase troponins and abnormal electrocardiograms mostly ST segment T wave abnormalities
Risk factors Condition follows an autosomal recessive patternThe mutated gene must be inherited from both the mother and father Both males and females must have an equal frequency of inheritance
Buccal exostoses are bony hamartomas which are non malignant exophytic nodular outgrowths of dense cortical bone that are relatively avascular Symptoms Buccal exostoses generally tend to be asymptomatic and are usually painless However they may increase patient concern about poor aesthetics inability to perform oral hygiene procedures due to difficulty in cleaning around the area with a toothbrush and compromised periodontal health by causing food lodgement which could lead to patients reporting increased bleeding when tooth brushing Signs
The disease presents with the widespread formation of fluid filled blisters that are thin walled and easily ruptured and the patient can be positive for Nikolskys sign Ritters disease of the newborn is the most severe form of SSSS with similar signs and symptoms SSSS often includes a widespread painful erythroderma often involving the face diaper and other intertriginous areas Extensive areas of desquamation might be present Perioral crusting and fissuring are seen early in the course Unlike toxic epidermal necrolysis SSSS spares the mucous membranes It is most common in children under 6 years but can be seen in adults who are immunosuppressed or have kidney failure
Early signs of melanoma are changes to the shape or color of existing moles or in the case of nodular melanoma the appearance of a new lump anywhere on the skin At later stages the mole may itch ulcerate or bleed Early signs of melanoma are summarized by the mnemonic ABCDEF Asymmetry Borders irregular with edges and corners Colour variegated Diameter greater than 6 mm 0 24 in about the size of a pencil eraser Evolving over timeThis classification does not apply to nodular melanoma which has its own classifications Elevated above the skin surface Firm to the touch GrowingMetastatic melanoma may cause nonspecific paraneoplastic symptoms including loss of appetite nausea vomiting and fatigue Metastasis spread of early melanoma is possible but relatively rare less than a fifth of melanomas diagnosed early become metastatic Brain metastases are particularly common in patients with metastatic melanoma It can also spread to the liver bones abdomen or distant lymph nodes
The conjunctiva is a thin membrane that covers the eye When an allergen irritates the conjunctiva common symptoms that occur in the eye include ocular itching eyelid swelling tearing photophobia watery discharge and foreign body sensation with pain Itching is the most typical symptom of ocular allergy and more than 75 of patients report this symptom when seeking treatment Symptoms are usually worse for patients when the weather is warm and dry whereas cooler weather with lower temperatures and rain tend to assuage symptoms Signs in phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis include small yellow nodules that develop over the cornea which ulcerate after a few days A study by Klein et al showed that in addition to the physical discomfort allergic conjunctivitis causes it also alters patients routines with patients limiting certain activities such as going outdoors reading sleeping and driving Therefore treating patients with allergic conjunctivitis may improve their everyday quality of life
Fibroadenomas are benign not harmful in effect tumours of the breast most often present in women in their 20s and 30s Clinically fibroadenomas are usually solid breast lumps that are Painless Firm or rubbery Mobile Solitary round with distinct smooth borders People who have a simple fibroadenoma have a slightly increased risk of developing malignant harmful breast cancer Complex fibroadenomas may increase the risk of breast cancer In the male breast fibroepithelial tumors are very rare and are mostly phyllodes tumors Exceptionally rare case reports exist of fibroadenomas in the male breast however these cases may be associated with antiandrogen treatment
The symptoms of fungal keratitis typically emerge over 5 10 days and present with a painful eye blurred vision and redness of eye There is increased sensitivity to light and excessive tears or discharge The symptoms are markedly less as compared to a similar bacterial ulcer Symptoms may be noted to persist after contact lenses are removed or following antibiotic treatment Signs The eyelids and adnexa involved shows edema and redness conjunctiva is chemosed Ulcer may be present It is a dry looking corneal ulcer with satellite lesions in the surrounding cornea Usually associated with fungal ulcer is hypopyon which is mostly white fluffy in appearance Rarely it may extend to the posterior segment to cause endophthalmitis in later stages leading to the destruction of the eye Note Fungal endophthalmitis is extremely rare
Fused molar roots Single root canal Juvenile glaucoma Sparse body hair Distinct facial features full upper lip absence of cupids bow thick philtrum Syndactyly Increased pigmentation of finger joints Clinodactyly of fifth finger
The symptoms of stimulant psychosis vary depending on the drug ingested but generally involve the symptoms of organic psychosis such as hallucinations delusions or paranoia Other symptoms may include mania erratic behavior agitation and or aggression
Three categories used for classifying the severity of brain injuries are mild moderate or severe
Midfacial malformations can be subdivided into two different groups One group with hypertelorism this includes FND The other with hypotelorism a decreased distance between the eyes this includes holoprosencephaly failure of development of the forebrain In addition a craniofacial cleft can be classified using the Tessier classification Each of the clefts is numbered from 0 to 14 The 15 different types of clefts are then subdivided into 4 groups based on their anatomical position in the face midline clefts paramedian clefts orbital clefts and lateral clefts FND is a midline cleft classified as Tessier 0 14 Besides this the additional anomalies seen in FND can be subdivided by region None of these anomalies are specific for the syndrome of FND but they do occur more often in patients with FND than in the population The anomalies that may be present are
Genetics This syndrome is caused by pathogenic variants mutations in the VPS13B gene at chromosomal locus 8q22 It has an autosomal recessive transmission with variable expression Variants in VSP13B also cause Mirhosseini Holmes Walton syndrome which is now considered to be the same entity as Cohen syndrome
All forms of MDDS are very rare MDDS causes a wide range of symptoms which can appear in newborns infants children or adults depending on the class of MDDS within each class symptoms are also diverse In MDDS associated with mutations in TK2 infants generally develop normally but by around two years of age symptoms of general muscle weakness called hypotonia tiredness lack of stamina and difficulty feeding begin to appear Some toddlers start to lose control of the muscles in their face mouth and throat and may have difficulty swallowing Motor skills that had been learned may be lost but generally the functioning of the brain and ability to think are not affected In MDDS associated with mutations in SUCLA2 or SUCLG1 that primarily affect the brain and muscle hypotonia generally arises in infants before they are 6 months old their muscles begin wasting away and there is delay in psychomotor learning learning basic skills like walking talking and intentional coordinated movement The spine often begins to curve scoliosis or kyphosis and the child often has abnormal movements dystonia athetosis or chorea difficulty feeding acid reflux hearing loss stunted growth and difficulty breathing that can lead to frequent lung infections Sometime epilepsy develops In MDDS associated with mutations in RRM2B that primarily affect the brain and muscle there is again hypotonia in the first months symptoms of lactic acidosis like nausea vomiting and rapid deep breathing failure to thrive including the head remaining small delay or regression in moving and hearing loss Many body systems are affected The Charlie Gard case was associated with this sub form of the disease In MDDS associated with mutations in DGUOK that primarily affect the brain and the liver there are two forms There is an early onset form in which symptoms arise from problems in many organs in the first week of life especially symptoms of lactic acidosis as well as low blood sugar Within weeks of birth they can develop liver failure and the associated jaundice and abdominal swelling and many neurological problems including developmental delays and regression and uncontrolled eye movement Rarely within this class of already rare diseases symptoms only relating to liver disease emerge later in infancy or in childhood In MDDS associated with mutations in MPV17 that primarily affect the brain and the liver the symptoms are similar to those caused by DGUOK and also emerge shortly after birth generally with fewer and less severe neurological problems There is a subset of people of Navajo descent who develop Navajo neurohepatopathy who in addition to these symptoms also have easily broken bones that do not cause pain deformed hands or feet and problems with their corneas In MDDS associated with mutations in POLG that primarily affect the brain and the liver the symptoms are very diverse and can emerge anytime from shortly after birth to old age The first signs of the disease which include intractable seizures and failure to meet meaningful developmental milestones usually occur in infancy after the first year of life but sometimes as late as the fifth year Primary symptoms of the disease are developmental delay progressive intellectual disability hypotonia low muscle tone spasticity stiffness of the limbs possibly leading to quadriplegia and progressive dementia Seizures may include epilepsia partialis continua a type of seizure that consists of repeated myoclonic muscle jerks Optic atrophy may also occur often leading to blindness Hearing loss may also occur Additionally although physical signs of chronic liver dysfunction may not be present many people experience liver impairment leading to liver failure In MDDS associated with mutations in PEO1 C10orf2 that primarily affect the brain and the liver symptoms emerge shortly after birth or in early infancy with hypotonia symptoms of lactic acidosis enlarged liver feeding problems lack of growth and delay of psychomotor skills Neurologically development is slowed or stopped and epilepsy emerges as do sensory problems like loss of eye control and deafness and neuromuscular problems like a lack of reflexes muscular atrophy and twitching and epilepsy In MDDS associated with mutations in the genes associated with mutations in ECGF1 TYMP that primarily affects the brain and the gastrointestinal tract symptoms can emerge any time in the first fifty years of life most often they emerge before the person turns 20 Weight loss is common as is a lack of the ability of the stomach and intestines to automatically expand and contract and thus move through it called gastrointestinal motility this leads to feeling full after eating only small amounts of food nausea acid reflux All affected individuals develop weight loss and progressive gastrointestinal dysmotility manifesting as early satiety nausea diarrhea vomiting and stomach pain and swelling People also develop neuropathy with weakness and tingling There are often eye problems and intellectual disability
The symptoms of mycosis fungoides are categorized into three clinical stages the patch stage the plaque stage and the tumour stage The patch stage is defined by flat reddish patches of varying sizes that may have a wrinkled appearance They can also look yellowish in people with darker skin The plaque stage follows the patch stage of mycosis fungoides It is characterized by the presence of raised lesions that appear reddish brown in darker skin tones plaques may have a greyish or silver appearance Both patch and plaque stages are considered early stage mycosis fungoides The tumour stage typically shows large irregular lumps Tumours can develop form plaques or normal skin in any region of the body including the face and head regions The symptoms displayed are progressive with early stages consisting of lesions presented as scaly patches Lesions often initially develop on the trunk of the body in places that are rarely exposed to the sun such as the buttocks These lesions can start as insignificant patches and may remain undiagnosed for up to a decade Hypopigmentation when the skin is lighter than normal of lesions are less common but can be found in children adolescents and or dark skinned individuals The advanced stage of mycosis fungoides is characterized by generalized erythroderma red rash covering most of the body with severe pruritus itching and scaling Itching Pruritus is the most commonly reported symptom of people experiencing mycosis fungoides with up to 88 of people reporting varying intensities of pruritus that typically worsens as the disease progresses Those that experience intense pruritus commonly indicate that it negatively affects their quality of life emotionally functionally and physically Mycosis fungoides MF and Sézary syndrome SS are related conditions with the same type of cancer t lymphocytes that initially grow in different body compartments SS cells are mainly found in the blood whereas MF typically involves the skin In advanced stages of MF the cancer cells move from the skin into the blood stream and other organs and is referred to as leukemic mycosis fungoides Sézary syndrome preceded by mycosis fungoides or secondary mycosis fungoides
Organs most commonly affected by haemochromatosis include the liver heart and endocrine glands Haemochromatosis may present with the following clinical syndromes
Symptoms include chest or shoulder pain cough dyspnea and shortness of breath Chest and shoulder pain can be radiating out to the shoulder blades A dry cough can also present and come with a crackling sound upon inhaling Typically it occurs in women aged 30 to 40 years but it has been diagnosed in young girls as early as 10 years of age and post menopausal women exclusively in women of menstrual age most with a history of pelvic endometriosis Chest pain requires immediate medical attention
Acrocallosal syndrome ACLS ACS Schinzel type Hallux duplication is a rare heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder first discovered by Albert Schinzel 1979 in a 3 year old boy Characteristics of this syndrome include agenesis of the corpus callosum macrocephaly hypertelorism poor motor skills intellectual disability extra fingers and toes particularly hallux duplication and cleft palate Seizures may also occur
Symptoms related to aortic stenosis depend on the degree of stenosis Most people with mild to moderate aortic stenosis do not have symptoms Symptoms usually present in individuals with severe aortic stenosis though they may also occur in those with mild to moderate aortic stenosis The three main symptoms of aortic stenosis are loss of consciousness anginal chest pain and shortness of breath with activity or other symptoms of heart failure such as shortness of breath while lying flat episodes of shortness of breath at night or swollen legs and feet It may also be accompanied by the characteristic Dresden china appearance of pallor with a light flush
The symptoms of this syndrome are but are not limited to cranio facial dysmorphisms such as macrocephaly frontal bossing low set ears hypertelorism etc intellectual disabilities speech and motor delays and heart ocular renal and skeletal defects such as patent foramen ovale heart or brachydactyly type D skeletal
In early childhood symptoms that correlate with a later diagnosis of dyslexia include delayed onset of speech and a lack of phonological awareness A common myth closely associates dyslexia with mirror writing and reading letters or words backwards These behaviors are seen in many children as they learn to read and write and are not considered to be defining characteristics of dyslexia School age children with dyslexia may exhibit signs of difficulty in identifying or generating rhyming words or counting the number of syllables in words both of which depend on phonological awareness They may also show difficulty in segmenting words into individual sounds such as sounding out the three sounds of k a and t in cat or may struggle to blend sounds indicating reduced phonemic awareness Difficulties with word retrieval or naming things is also associated with dyslexia 647 People with dyslexia are commonly poor spellers a feature sometimes called dysorthographia or dysgraphia which depends on the skill of orthographic coding Problems persist into adolescence and adulthood and may include difficulties with summarizing stories memorization reading aloud or learning foreign languages Adults with dyslexia can often read with good comprehension though they tend to read more slowly than others without a learning difficulty and perform worse in spelling tests or when reading nonsense words a measure of phonological awareness
Torticollis is a fixed or dynamic tilt rotation with flexion or extension of the head and or neck The type of torticollis can be described depending on the positions of the head and neck laterocollis the head is tipped toward the shoulder rotational torticollis the head rotates along the longitudinal axis anterocollis forward flexion of the head and neck retrocollis hyperextension of head and neck backwardA combination of these movements may often be observed Torticollis can be a disorder in itself as well as a symptom in other conditions Other symptoms include Neck pain Occasional formation of a mass Thickened or tight sternocleidomastoid muscle Tenderness on the cervical spine Tremor in head Unequal shoulder heights Decreased neck movement
Aquarium granuloma presents as a slow growing inflamed red bump nodule or plaque at the site of infection It is characterized by a painful itchy skin lesion and may become ulcerated or crusted Skin changes usually appear roughly three weeks after the aquatic exposure If this condition is acquired from an aquarium then often the dominant hand is affected If this condition is acquired from a swimming pool then symptoms can also develop on trauma prone body zones such as the elbows knees feet and tip of the nose
When symptomatic the disease classically begins with symptoms that are similar to a gout attack thus the moniker pseudogout These include severe pain warmth swelling of one or more jointsThe symptoms can be monoarticular involving a single joint or polyarticular involving several joints Symptoms usually last for days to weeks and often recur Although any joint may be affected the knees wrists and hips are most common X ray CT or other imaging usually shows accumulation of calcium within the joint cartilage known as chondrocalcinosis There can also be findings of osteoarthritis The white blood cell count is often raised
Symptoms include swelling in the elbow which can sometimes be large enough to restrict motion There is pain originating in the elbow joint from mild to severe which can spread to the rest of the arm If the bursa is infected there also will be prominent redness and the skin will feel very warm Another symptom would include the infected bursa possibly opening spontaneously and draining pus
Warm skin over site of infection The person may also have chills and a high fever between 38 and 40 degrees Celsius along with moderate throbbing pain and swelling The red streaks can be clearly outlined and demarcated or just barely visible particularly in dark skinned patients Malaise tenderness at the site of infection skin ulcers a rare symptom of lymphangitis rapid pulse and enlarged swollen and tender lymph nodes are also seen Appetite loss has been documented with the presence of inflammation inflammation associated anorexia but it is unclear whether appetite loss seen in patients with lymphangitis leads to weight loss in cases that develop after lymphedema which can be upwards of 8 14 of the time weight gain has actually been documented If these symptoms are absent it is suggestive of other underlying disorders such as tuberculosis lymphoma or Hodgkin s disease A person with lymphangitis should be hospitalized and closely monitored by medical professionals In very minor cases regular application of antibiotic creams and cleanliness of the area can accelerate the healing process with no medical professional intervention or consultation required When the inferior limbs are affected the redness of the skin runs over the great saphenous vein location and can be confused for thrombophlebitis
The symptoms experienced in cholesterol embolism depend largely on the organ involved Non specific symptoms often described are fever muscle ache and weight loss Embolism to the legs causes a mottled appearance and purple discoloration of the toes small infarcts and areas of gangrene due to tissue death that usually appear black and areas of the skin that assume a marbled pattern known as livedo reticularis The pain is usually severe and requires opiates If the ulcerated plaque is below the renal arteries the manifestations appear in both lower extremities Very rarely the ulcerated plaque is below the aortic bifurcation and those cases the changes occur only in one lower extremity Kidney involvement leads to the symptoms of kidney failure which are non specific but usually cause nausea reduced appetite anorexia raised blood pressure hypertension and occasionally the various symptoms of electrolyte disturbance such as an irregular heartbeat Some patients report hematuria bloody urine but this may only be detectable on microscopic examination of the urine Increased amounts of protein in the urine may cause edema swelling of the skin a combination of symptoms known as nephrotic syndrome If emboli have spread to the digestive tract reduced appetite nausea and vomiting may occur as well as nonspecific abdominal pain gastrointestinal hemorrhage vomiting blood or admixture of blood in the stool and occasionally acute pancreatitis inflammation of the pancreas Both the central nervous system brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system may be involved Emboli to the brain may cause stroke like episodes headache and episodes of loss of vision in one eye known as amaurosis fugax Emboli to the eye can be seen by ophthalmoscopy and are known as plaques of Hollenhorst Emboli to the spinal cord may cause paraparesis decreased power in the legs or cauda equina syndrome a group of symptoms due to loss of function of the distal part of the spinal cord loss of control over the bladder rectum and skin sensation around the anus If the blood supply to a single nerve is interrupted by an embolus the result is loss of function in the muscles supplied by that nerve this phenomenon is called a mononeuropathy
Signs and symptoms of band keratopathy include eye pain and decreased visual acuity
Signs and symptoms may include a sudden pain in the epigastrium to the right of the midline indicating the perforation of a duodenal ulcer while a gastric ulcer perforation reveals itself by burning pain in epigastrium with flatulence and dyspepsia In intestinal perforation pain starts from the site of perforation and spreads across the abdomen Gastrointestinal perforation results in severe abdominal pain intensified by movement nausea vomiting and hematemesis Later symptoms include fever and or chills In any case the abdomen becomes rigid with tenderness and rebound tenderness After some time the abdomen becomes silent and heart sounds can be heard all over Patient stops passing flatus and motion abdomen is distended The symptoms of esophageal rupture may include sudden onset of chest pain
Ceruminous adenoma are rare tumors accounting for less than 1 of all external ear tumors The patients will present with a mass perhaps associated pain and may have changes in hearing usually a sensorineural or a conductive hearing loss Some patients have tinnitus Nerve paralysis is very uncommon
As a result of lower motor neuron degeneration the symptoms of PMA include muscle weakness muscle atrophy fasciculationsSome patients have symptoms restricted only to the arms or legs or in some cases just one of either These cases are referred to as flail limb either flail arm or flail leg and are associated with a better prognosis
The hallmark of encephalopathy is an altered mental state or delirium Characteristic of the altered mental state is impairment of the cognition attention orientation sleep wake cycle and consciousness An altered state of consciousness may range from failure of selective attention to drowsiness Hypervigilance may be present with or without cognitive deficits headache epileptic seizures myoclonus involuntary twitching of a muscle or group of muscles or asterixis flapping tremor of the hand when wrist is extended Depending on the type and severity of encephalopathy common neurological symptoms are loss of cognitive function subtle personality changes and an inability to concentrate Other neurological signs may include dysarthria hypomimia problems with movements they can be clumsy or slow ataxia tremor Other neurological signs may include involuntary grasping and sucking motions nystagmus rapid involuntary eye movement jactitation restlessness while in bed and respiratory abnormalities such as Cheyne Stokes respiration cyclic waxing and waning of tidal volume apneustic respirations and post hypercapnic apnea Focal neurological deficits are less common Wernicke encephalopathy can co occur with Korsakoff alcoholic syndrome characterized by amnestic confabulatory syndrome retrograde amnesia anterograde amnesia confabulations invented memories poor recall and disorientation Anti NMDA receptor encephalitis is the most common autoimmune encephalitis It can cause paranoid and grandiose delusions agitation hallucinations visual and auditory bizarre behavior fear short term memory loss and confusion HIV encephalopathy can lead to dementia
Contact dermatitis is a localized rash or irritation of the skin caused by contact with a foreign substance Only the superficial regions of the skin are affected in contact dermatitis Inflammation of the affected tissue is present in the epidermis the outermost layer of skin and the outer dermis the layer beneath the epidermis Contact dermatitis results in large burning and itchy rashes These can take anywhere from several days to weeks to heal This differentiates it from contact urticaria hives in which a rash appears within minutes of exposure and then fades away within minutes to hours Even after days contact dermatitis fades only if the skin no longer comes in contact with the allergen or irritant Chronic contact dermatitis can develop when the removal of the offending agent no longer provides expected relief Irritant dermatitis is usually confined to the area where the trigger actually touched the skin whereas allergic dermatitis may be more widespread on the skin Irritant dermatitis usually found on hands whereas exposed areas of skin Symptoms of both forms include the following
Radial tunnel syndrome causes posterolateral elbow pain that is similar to tennis elbow and may sometimes occur in conjunction with that condition Patients may typically have weakness of extension at the wrist and third digit The pain is often reproduced upon resisted supination of the forearm and pain at the radial tunnel on resisted hyperextension of the wrist
Skin and connective tissues Initial facial changes usually involve the area of the face covered by the temporal or buccinator muscles The disease progressively spreads from the initial location resulting in atrophy of the skin and its adnexa as well as underlying subcutaneous structures such as connective tissue fat fascia cartilage bones and or muscles of one side of the face The mouth and nose are typically deviated towards the affected side of the face The process may eventually extend to involve tissues between the nose and the upper corner of the lip the upper jaw the angle of the mouth the area around the eye and brow the ear and or the neck The syndrome often begins with a circumscribed patch of scleroderma in the frontal region of the scalp which is associated with a loss of hair and the appearance of a depressed linear scar extending down through the midface on the affected side This scar is referred to as a coup de sabre lesion because it resembles the scar of a wound made by a sabre and is indistinguishable from the scar observed in frontal linear scleroderma In 20 of cases the hair and skin overlying affected areas may become hyperpigmented or hypopigmented with patches of unpigmented skin In up to 20 of cases the disease may involve the ipsilateral on the same side or contralateral on the opposite side neck trunk arm or leg The cartilage of the nose ear and larynx can be involved The disease has been reported to affect both sides of the face in 5 to 10 of cases Symptoms and physical findings usually become apparent during the first or early during the second decade of life The average age of onset is nine years of age and the majority of individuals experience symptoms before 20 years of age The disease may progress for several years before eventually going into remission abruptly ceasing
By far the most common hernias develop in the abdomen when a weakness in the abdominal wall evolves into a localized hole or defect through which adipose tissue or abdominal organs covered with peritoneum may protrude Another common hernia involves the spinal discs and causes sciatica A hiatus hernia occurs when the stomach protrudes into the mediastinum through the esophageal opening in the diaphragm Hernias may or may not present with either pain at the site a visible or palpable lump or in some cases more vague symptoms resulting from pressure on an organ that has become stuck in the hernia sometimes leading to organ dysfunction Fatty tissue usually enters a hernia first but it may be followed or accompanied by an organ Hernias are caused by a disruption or opening in the fascia or fibrous tissue which forms the abdominal wall It is possible for the bulge associated with a hernia to come and go but the defect in the tissue will persist Symptoms and signs vary depending on the type of hernia Symptoms may or may not be present in some inguinal hernias In the case of reducible hernias a bulge in the groin or in another abdominal area can often be seen and felt When standing such a bulge becomes more obvious Besides the bulge other symptoms include pain in the groin that may also include a heavy or dragging sensation and in men there is sometimes pain and swelling in the scrotum around the testicular area Irreducible abdominal hernias or incarcerated hernias may be painful but their most relevant symptom is that they cannot return to the abdominal cavity when pushed in They may be chronic although painless and can lead to strangulation loss of blood supply obstruction kinking of intestine or both Strangulated hernias are always painful and pain is followed by tenderness Nausea vomiting or fever may occur in these cases due to bowel obstruction Also the hernia bulge in this case may turn red purple or dark and pink In the diagnosis of abdominal hernias imaging is the principal means of detecting internal diaphragmatic and other nonpalpable or unsuspected hernias Multidetector CT MDCT can show with precision the anatomic site of the hernia sac the contents of the sac and any complications MDCT also offers clear detail of the abdominal wall allowing wall hernias to be identified accurately
Urine protein loss leads to total body swelling generalized edema and abdominal distension in the first several weeks to months of life Fluid retention may lead to cough from pulmonary edema ascites and widened cranial sutures and fontanelles High urine protein loss can lead to foamy appearance of urine Infants may be born prematurely with low birth weight and have meconium stained amniotic fluid or a large placenta
The warning signs of early speech delay are categorized into age related milestones beginning at the age of 12 months and continuing through early adolescence At the age of 12 months there is cause for concern if the child is not able to do the following
The various signs and symptoms in Sheehans syndrome are caused by damage to the pituitary thereby causing a decrease in one or more of the hormones it normally secretes Because the pituitary controls many glands in the endocrine system partial or complete loss of a variety of functions may result The most common initial symptoms of Sheehans syndrome are agalactorrhea absence of lactation and or difficulties with lactation Many women also report amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after delivery In some cases a woman with Sheehan syndrome is relatively asymptomatic therefore the diagnosis would not be made until years later with features of hypopituitarism Such features include secondary hypothyroidism hypothyroidism due to pituitary dysfunction with tiredness intolerance to cold constipation weight gain hair loss and slowed thinking as well as a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure Another such feature is secondary adrenal insufficiency lack of ACTH secretion from the anterior pituitary In a more chronic case it is similar to Addisons disease with symptoms including fatigue weight loss hypoglycemia low blood sugar levels anemia and hyponatremia low sodium levels Such a patient may become acutely exacerbated when her body is stressed by a severe infection or surgery years after her delivery a condition equivalent with an Addisonian crisis The symptoms of adrenal crisis should be treated immediately and can be life threatening Gonadotropin deficiency will often cause amenorrhea oligomenorrhea hot flashes or decreased libido Cessation of menses is an important indicator of Gonadotropin deficiency as a result of Sheehan s syndrome Growth hormone deficiency causes many vague symptoms including fatigue and decreased muscle mass Growth hormone deficiency is the most common symptom of hypopituitarism seen in Sheehan s syndrome with a 90 100 occurrence seen in the Netherlands Costa Rica and Saudi Arabia In these populations the occurrence of Cortisol TSH and gonadotropin deficiencies ranges from 50 to 100 Hematological changes may occur due to a decrease in erythropoietin synthesis as a result of these cortisol and thyroid hormone decreases Uncommonly Sheehan syndrome may also appear acutely after delivery mainly by hyponatremia Electrolytic imbalances might result from the increased secretion of ADH which may be caused by a decrease in blood pressure due to glucocorticoid deficiency There are several possible mechanisms by which hypopituitarism can result in hyponatremia including decreased free water clearance by hypothyroidism direct syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ADH hypersecretion decreased free water clearance by glucocorticoid deficiency independent of ADH Serum potassium levels however will not change due to Sheehan s syndrome This is because potassium levels are primarily regulated independently from the pituitary gland the renin angiotensin aldosterone system begins in the kidney
Onset The length of time between exposure to the virus and the development of symptoms incubation period is between 2 and 21 days and usually between 4 and 10 days However recent estimates based on mathematical models predict that around 5 of cases may take longer than 21 days to develop Symptoms usually begin with a sudden influenza like stage characterised by fatigue fever weakness decreased appetite muscular pain joint pain headache and sore throat The fever is usually higher than 38 3 C 101 F This is often followed by nausea vomiting diarrhoea abdominal pain and sometimes hiccups The combination of severe vomiting and diarrhoea often leads to severe dehydration Next shortness of breath and chest pain may occur along with swelling headaches and confusion In about half of the cases the skin may develop a maculopapular rash a flat red area covered with small bumps five to seven days after symptoms begin
HGPIN in isolation is asymptomatic It is typically discovered in prostate biopsies taken to rule out prostate cancer and very frequently seen in prostates removed for prostate cancer
The symptoms of vaginal thrush include vulval itching vulval soreness and irritation pain or discomfort during sexual intercourse superficial dyspareunia pain or discomfort during urination dysuria and vaginal discharge which is usually odourless Although the vaginal discharge associated with yeast infection is often described as thick and lumpy like paper paste or cottage cheese it can also be thin and watery or thick and of uniform texture In one study women with vaginal yeast infection were no more likely to describe their discharge as cottage cheese like than women without As well as the above symptoms of thrush vulvovaginal inflammation can also be present The signs of vulvovaginal inflammation include erythema redness of the vagina and vulva vaginal fissuring cracked skin edema swelling from a build up of fluid also in severe cases satellite lesions sores in the surrounding area This is rare but may indicate the presence of another fungal condition or the herpes simplex virus the virus that causes genital herpes Vaginal candidiasis can very rarely cause congenital candidiasis in newborns
Athetosis can vary from mild to severe motor dysfunction it is generally characterized by unbalanced involuntary movements of muscle and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture The associated motor dysfunction can be restricted to a part of the body or present throughout the body depending on the individual and the severity of the symptom One of the pronounced signs can be observed in the extremities in particular as the writhing convoluted movement of the digits Athetosis can appear as early as 18 months from birth with first signs including difficulty feeding hypotonia spasm and involuntary writhing movements of the hands feet and face which progressively worsen through adolescence and at times of emotional distress Athetosis is caused by lesions in several brain areas such as the hippocampus and the motor thalamus as well as the corpus striatum therefore children during the developmental age could possibly suffer from severe communication deficits such as speech impairment hearing loss and failed or delayed acquirement of sitting balance although most people with athetosis have normal or near normal intelligence
Signs observed by a clinician and symptoms experienced by a patient vary depending on where the spine is injured and the extent of the injury A section of skin innervated through a specific part of the spine is called a dermatome and injury to that part of the spine can cause pain numbness or a loss of sensation in the related areas Paraesthesia a tingling or burning sensation in affected areas of the skin is another symptom A person with a lowered level of consciousness may show a response to a painful stimulus above a certain point but not below it A group of muscles innervated through a specific part of the spine is called a myotome and injury to that part of the spinal cord can cause problems with movements that involve those muscles The muscles may contract uncontrollably spasticity become weak or be completely paralysed Spinal shock loss of neural activity including reflexes below the level of injury occurs shortly after the injury and usually goes away within a day Priapism an erection of the penis may be a sign of acute spinal cord injury The specific parts of the body affected by loss of function are determined by the level of injury Some signs such as bowel and bladder dysfunction can occur at any level Neurogenic bladder involves a compromised ability to empty the bladder and is a common symptom of spinal cord injury This can lead to high pressures in the bladder that can damage the kidneys
The afflicted may have relatively small amounts of pain that will quickly increase in severity over a time period of 6 12 weeks The skin temperature around the bone may increase a bony swelling may be evident and movement may be restricted in adjacent joints Spinal lesions may cause quadriplegia and patients with skull lesions may have headaches
Abnormal blistering of the skin Abnormality of hair texture Dry skin Aminoaciduria Hyperhidrosis Ichthyosis
Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata has the following symptoms Bilateral shortening of the femur Post natal growth problems deficiency Cataracts Intellectual disability Possible seizures Possible infections of respiratory tract
Impaired fasting glucose is often without any signs or symptoms other than higher than normal glucose levels being detected in an individuals fasting blood sample There may be signs and symptoms associated with elevated blood glucose though these are likely to be minor with significant symptoms suggestive of complete progression to type 2 diabetes Such symptoms include Increased thirst Increased urination especially waking up in the night to urinate Tiredness and fatigue Blurred vision Slow healing of wounds Altered sensation such as numbness or tingling particularly of the hands and feet Recurrent and difficult to clear infections particularly of the urinary tract
An early warning sign prodrome of the possibility of developing alcoholic polyneuropathy especially in a chronic alcoholic would be weight loss because this usually signifies a nutritional deficiency that can lead to the development of the disease Alcoholic polyneuropathy usually has a gradual onset over months or even years although axonal degeneration often begins before an individual experiences any symptoms The disease typically involves sensory issues and motor loss as well as painful physical perceptions though all sensory modalities may be involved Symptoms that affect the sensory and motor systems seem to develop symmetrically For example if the right foot is affected the left foot is affected simultaneously or soon becomes affected In most cases the legs are affected first followed by the arms The hands usually become involved when the symptoms reach above the ankle This is called a stocking and glove pattern of sensory disturbances
Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea and vomiting headache short term memory loss confusion lethargy fatigue loss of appetite irritability muscle weakness spasms or cramps seizures and decreased consciousness or coma Lower levels of plasma sodium are associated with more severe symptoms However mild hyponatremia plasma sodium levels at 131 135 mmol L may be associated with complications and subtle symptoms for example increased falls altered posture and gait reduced attention impaired cognition and possibly higher rates of death Neurological symptoms typically occur with very low levels of plasma sodium usually 115 mmol L When sodium levels in the blood become very low water enters the brain cells and causes them to swell cerebral edema This results in increased pressure in the skull and causes hyponatremic encephalopathy As pressure increases in the skull herniation of the brain can occur which is a squeezing of the brain across the internal structures of the skull This can lead to headache nausea vomiting confusion seizures brain stem compression and respiratory arrest and non cardiogenic accumulation of fluid in the lungs This is usually fatal if not immediately treated Symptom severity depends on how fast and how severe the drop in blood sodium level is A gradual drop even to very low levels may be tolerated well if it occurs over several days or weeks because of neuronal adaptation The presence of underlying neurological disease such as a seizure disorder or non neurological metabolic abnormalities also affects the severity of neurologic symptoms Chronic hyponatremia can lead to such complications as neurological impairments These neurological impairments most often affect gait walking and attention and can lead to increased reaction time and falls Hyponatremia by interfering with bone metabolism has been linked with a doubled risk of osteoporosis and an increased risk of bone fracture
Most patients present with a very rapidly growing mass that often gives a bluish appearance in the mouth This is because the pigmentation in the cells appears blue through the overlying epithelium mucosa By imaging studies there is usually a large expansive radiolucent clear mass without well defined borders Calcifications within the mass may be seen More than 70 involve the maxilla usually maxillary anterior alveolar ridge while the mandible and skull are affected less often There is often an elevated vanilmandelic acid level
Parinauds syndrome is a cluster of abnormalities of eye movement and pupil dysfunction characterized by
A common symptom of polyQ diseases is the progressive degeneration of nerve cells usually affecting people later in life Although these diseases share the same repeated codon CAG and some symptoms the repeats are found in different unrelated genes In all cases the expanded CAG repeats are translated into an uninterrupted sequence of glutamine residues forming a polyQ tract and the accumulation of polyQ proteins damages key cellular functions such as the ubiquitin proteasome system However different polyQ containing proteins damage different subsets of neurons leading to different symptoms As of 2017 ten neurological and neuromuscular disorders were known to be caused by an increased number of CAG repeats The non PolyQ diseases do not share any specific symptoms and are unlike the PolyQ diseases In some of these diseases such as Fragile X syndrome the pathology is caused by lack of the normal function of the protein encoded by the affected gene In others such as Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 the pathology is caused by a change in protein expression or function mediated through changes in the messenger RNA produced by the expression of the affected gene In yet others the pathology is caused by toxic assemblies of RNA in the nuclei of cells
The symptoms of Leydig cell hypoplasia include pseudohermaphroditism i e feminized ambiguous or relatively mildly underdeveloped e g micropenis severe hypospadias and or cryptorchidism undescended testes external genitalia a female gender identity or gender variance hypergonadotropic hypogonadism hypogonadism despite high levels of gonadotropins delayed impaired or fully absent puberty with an associated reduction in or complete lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics sexual infantilism impaired fertility or complete sterility tall stature due to delayed epiphyseal closure eunuchoid skeletal proportions delayed or absent bone maturation and osteoporosis
A papillary fibroelastoma is generally considered pathologically benign however outflow obstruction or embolism can be associated with syncope chest pain heart attack stroke and sudden cardiac death Symptoms due to papillary fibroelastomas are generally due to either mechanical effects of the tumor or due to embolization of a portion of the tumor to a distal organ In particular chest pain or syncope may be due to transient occlusion of the left main coronary artery by the tumor while a heart attack or sudden cardiac death may be due to embolization of a portion of the tumor into a coronary artery
MCAS is a condition that affects multiple systems generally in an inflammatory manner Symptoms typically wax and wane over time varying in severity and duration Many signs and symptoms are the same as those for mastocytosis because both conditions result in too many mediators released by mast cells It has many overlapping characteristics with recurrent idiopathic anaphylaxis although there are distinguishing symptoms specifically hives and angioedema Common symptoms include Dermatological flushing hives easy bruising either a reddish or a pale complexion itchiness burning feeling dermatographism Cardiovascular lightheadedness dizziness presyncope syncope arrhythmia tachycardia Gastrointestinal diarrhea and or constipation cramping intestinal discomfort nausea vomiting acid reflux swallowing difficulty throat tightness Respiratory congestion coughing wheezing Anaphylaxis If too many mediators are released into a patients system they may also experience anaphylaxis which primarily includes difficulty breathing itchy hives flushing or pale skin feeling of warmth weak and rapid pulse nausea vomiting diarrhea dizziness and fainting
Sperm granulomas appear as hard and firm nodules that do not exceed 1 cm in size Sperm granulomas form in 20 50 of vasectomy procedures An injury to the epididymal epithelium is caused by penetration of germ cells into the epididymal supportive tissue This infiltration of germ cells allows for the pathogenesis of sperm granulomas Moreover the penetration of germ cells leads to inflammatory and autoimmune reactions that further increase the risk of sperm granuloma formation Sperm granuloma can also mimic the presence of an abnormal number of testis on ultrasound Sperm granulomas are mostly asymptomatic However they can cause pain and swelling of the epididymis spermatic cord and testis The pain usually radiates to the groin the junctional area between the abdominal wall and the thigh and can imitate the feeling of kidney spasms
Heat stroke generally presents with a hyperthermia of greater than 40 6 C 105 1 F in combination with disorientation However high body temperature does not necessarily indicate that heat stroke is present such as with people in high performance endurance sports or with people experiencing fevers Exertional heat stroke is more accurately diagnosed based on a constellation of symptoms rather than just a specific temperature threshold There is generally a lack of sweating in classic heatstroke while sweating is generally present in exertional heatstroke Early symptoms of heat stroke include behavioral changes confusion delirium dizziness weakness agitation combativeness slurred speech nausea and vomiting In some individuals with exertional heatstroke seizures and sphincter incontinence have also been reported Additionally in exertional heat stroke the affected person may sweat excessively If treatment is delayed patients could develop vital organ damage unconsciousness and even organ failure In the absence of prompt and adequate treatment heatstroke can be fatal
Some or all of the following may be seen in someone with Gorlin syndrome Multiple basal cell carcinomas of the skin Odontogenic keratocyst Seen in 75 of patients and is the most common finding There are usually multiple lesions found in the mandible They occur at a young age 19 years average Rib and vertebrae anomalies Intracranial calcification Skeletal abnormalities bifid ribs kyphoscoliosis early calcification of falx cerebri diagnosed with AP radiograph Distinct faces frontal and temporoparietal bossing hypertelorism and mandibular prognathism Bilateral ovarian fibromas 10 develop cardiac fibromas
Many symptoms are attributed to the development of Hashimotos thyroiditis The most common symptoms include fatigue weight gain pale or puffy face feeling cold joint and muscle pain constipation dry and thinning hair heavy menstrual flow or irregular periods depression panic disorder a slowed heart rate and problems getting pregnant and miscarriages Hashimotos disease is about seven times more common in women than in men It can occur in teens and young women but more commonly appears in middle age particularly for men People who develop Hashimotos disease often have family members who have thyroid or other autoimmune diseases and sometimes have other autoimmune diseases themselves The thyroid gland may become firm large and lobulated in Hashimotos thyroiditis but changes in the thyroid can also be nonpalpable Enlargement of the thyroid is due to lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis rather than tissue hypertrophy While their role in the initial destruction of the follicles is unclear antibodies against thyroid peroxidase or thyroglobulin are relevant as they serve as markers for detecting the disease and its severity They are thought to be the secondary products of the T cell mediated destruction of the gland It is also characterized by invasion of the thyroid tissue by leukocytes mainly T lymphocytes A rare but serious complication is thyroid lymphoma generally the B cell type non Hodgkin lymphoma
Most of the signs and symptoms of the Joubert syndrome appear very early in infancy with most children showing delays in gross motor milestones Although other signs and symptoms vary widely from individual to individual they generally fall under the hallmark of cerebellum involvement or in this case lack thereof Consequently the most common features include ataxia lack of muscle control hyperpnea abnormal breathing patterns sleep apnea abnormal eye and tongue movements and hypotonia in early childhood Other malformations such as polydactyly extra fingers and toes cleft lip or palate tongue abnormalities and seizures may also occur Developmental delays including cognitive are always present to some degree Severe forms have been noted to include hypoplasia of the corpus callosum Those with this syndrome often exhibit specific facial features such as a broad forehead arched eyebrows ptosis droopy eyelids hypertelorism widely spaced eyes low set ears and a triangle shaped mouth Additionally this disease can include a broad range of other abnormalities to other organ systems such as retinal dystrophy kidney diseases liver diseases skeletal deformities and endocrine hormonal problems
One particularity of diabetic cardiomyopathy is the long latent phase during which the disease progresses but is completely asymptomatic In most cases diabetic cardiomyopathy is detected with concomitant hypertension or coronary artery disease One of the earliest signs is mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction with little effect on ventricular filling Also the diabetic patient may show subtle signs of diabetic cardiomyopathy related to decreased left ventricular compliance or left ventricular hypertrophy or a combination of both A prominent a wave can also be noted in the jugular venous pulse and the cardiac apical impulse may be overactive or sustained throughout systole After the development of systolic dysfunction left ventricular dilation and symptomatic heart failure the jugular venous pressure may become elevated the apical impulse would be displaced downward and to the left Systolic mitral murmur is not uncommon in these cases These changes are accompanied by a variety of electrocardiographic changes that may be associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy in 60 of patients without structural heart disease although usually not in the early asymptomatic phase Later in the progression a prolonged QT interval may be indicative of fibrosis Given that diabetic cardiomyopathys definition excludes concomitant atherosclerosis or hypertension there are no changes in perfusion or in atrial natriuretic peptide levels up until the very late stages of the disease when the hypertrophy and fibrosis become very pronounced
How myiasis affects the human body depends on where the larvae are located Larvae may infect dead necrotic prematurely dying or living tissue in various sites the skin eyes ears stomach and intestinal tract or in genitourinary sites They may invade open wounds and lesions or unbroken skin Some enter the body through the nose or ears Larvae or eggs can reach the stomach or intestines if they are swallowed with food and cause gastric or intestinal myiasis Several different presentations of myiasis and their symptoms
Hypertension is rarely accompanied by symptoms and its identification is usually through screening or when seeking healthcare for an unrelated problem Some people with high blood pressure report headaches particularly at the back of the head and in the morning as well as lightheadedness vertigo tinnitus buzzing or hissing in the ears altered vision or fainting episodes These symptoms however might be related to associated anxiety rather than the high blood pressure itself On physical examination hypertension may be associated with the presence of changes in the optic fundus seen by ophthalmoscopy The severity of the changes typical of hypertensive retinopathy is graded from I to IV grades I and II may be difficult to differentiate The severity of the retinopathy correlates roughly with the duration or the severity of the hypertension
Physiological and symptomatic changes often vary according to the altitude involved The Lake Louise Consensus Definition for high altitude pulmonary edema has set widely used criteria for defining HAPE symptoms In the presence of a recent gain in altitude the presence of the following Symptoms at least two of
Children affected by pilocytic astrocytoma can present with different symptoms that might include failure to thrive lack of appropriate weight gain weight loss headache nausea vomiting irritability torticollis tilt neck or wry neck difficulty to coordinate movements and visual complaints including nystagmus The complaints may vary depending on the location and size of the neoplasm The most common symptoms are associated with increased intracranial pressure due to the size of the tumor mass
The signs and symptoms of impulse control disorders vary based on the age of the persons with them the actual type of impulse control that they are struggling with the environment in which they are living and whether they are male or female
Tracheomalacia occurs when the walls of the trachea collapse This can happen because the walls of the windpipe are weak or it can happen because something is pressing on it This may include hypotonia of the trachealis muscle The whole windpipe can be affected or only a short piece of it If the collapsed part of the windpipe goes past the area where the windpipe branches off into the two lungs it is called bronchomalacia This problem causes noisy or difficult breathing in the first 1 to 2 months after birth This is called congenital tracheomalacia it was present at birth It is not very common Babies born with tracheomalacia may have other health issues like a heart defect reflux or developmental delay Some children get tracheomalacia because of other health issues Symptoms can be mild to severe Symptoms inside the lung include noisy breathing that may get better when you change your babys position or while he or she is asleep Breathing problems that get worse during coughing crying feeding or colds High pitched sound during breathing stridor High pitched cough Rattling noise or wheezing with breathing
The clinical presentation of plastic bronchitis beyond expectoration of casts includes a productive cough dyspnea fever and wheezing Focal wheezing is a characteristic if not specific physical examination finding If the casts completely obstruct the airway breath sounds will be decreased and dullness will be present with percussion With partial obstruction a fan sound or flag flapping sound can be heard during auscultation Bronchial casts can sometimes fill the airways of almost an entire lung and present as an acute life threatening emergency
Central hypotonia accounts for 60 to 80 of all hypotonia in infants Hypotonic patients may display a variety of objective manifestations that indicate decreased muscle tone Motor skills delay is often observed along with hypermobile or hyperflexible joints drooling and speech difficulties poor reflexes decreased strength decreased activity tolerance rounded shoulder posture with leaning onto supports and poor attention The extent and occurrence of specific objective manifestations depends upon the age of the patient the severity of the hypotonia the specific muscles affected and sometimes the underlying cause For instance some people with hypotonia may experience constipation while others have no bowel problems
The pneumonia presents as a foreign body reaction causing cough dyspnea and often fever Hemoptysis has also been reported
The signs and symptoms of PAP include shortness of breath cough low grade fever and weight loss Additionally the clinical course of PAP is unpredictable Spontaneous remission is recognized and some patients have stable symptoms Death may occur due to the progression of PAP or of any underlying associated disease Individuals with PAP are more vulnerable to lung infections such as nocardiosis Mycobacterium avium intracellulare infection or fungal infections
In the past the term PCS was also used to refer to immediate physical symptoms or post concussive symptoms following a minor TBI or concussion The severity of these symptoms typically decreases rapidly In addition the nature of the symptoms may change over time acute symptoms are most commonly of a physical nature while persisting symptoms tend to be predominantly psychological Symptoms such as noise sensitivity problems with concentration and memory irritability depression and anxiety may be called late symptoms because they generally do not occur immediately after the injury but rather in the days or weeks after the injury Nausea and drowsiness commonly occur acutely following concussion Headache and dizziness occur immediately after the injury but also can be long lasting The condition is associated with a wide range of non specific symptoms physical such as headache cognitive such as difficulty concentrating and emotional and behavioral such as irritability Many of the symptoms associated with PCS are common or may be exacerbated by other disorders so there is considerable risk of misdiagnosis Headaches that occur after a concussion may feel like migraine headaches or tension type headaches Most headaches are tension type headaches which may be associated with a neck injury that occurred at the same time of the head injury
Observed physiological abnormalities of the condition include a dramatic overexpression of aromatase and accordingly excessive levels of estrogens including estrone and estradiol and a very high rate of peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens In one study cellular aromatase mRNA expression was found to be at least 10 times higher in a female patient compared to the control and the estradiol testosterone ratio after an injection of testosterone in a male patient was found to be 100 times greater than the control Additionally in another study androstenedione testosterone and dihydrotestosterone DHT were found to be either low or normal in males and follicle stimulating hormone FSH levels were very low likely due to suppression by estrogen which has antigonadotropic effects as a form of negative feedback inhibition on sex steroid production in sufficiently high amounts whereas luteinizing hormone LH levels were normal According to a recent review estrone levels have been elevated in 17 of 18 patients 94 while estradiol levels have been elevated only in 13 of 27 patients 48 As such estrone is the main estrogen elevated in the condition In more than half of patients circulating androstenedione and testosterone levels are low to subnormal The ratio of circulating estradiol to testosterone is 10 in 75 of cases FSH levels are said to be consistently low in the condition while LH levels are in the low to normal range It is notable that gynecomastia has been observed in patients in whom estradiol levels are within the normal range This has been suggested to be due to in situ conversion of adrenal androgens into estrone and then estradiol via local 17β HSD in breast tissue where aromatase activity may be particularly high The symptoms of AEXS in males include heterosexual precocity precocious puberty with phenotypically inappropriate secondary sexual characteristics i e a fully or mostly feminized appearance severe prepubertal or peripubertal gynecomastia development of breasts in males before or around puberty high pitched voice sparse facial hair hypogonadism dysfunctional gonads oligozoospermia low sperm count small testes micropenis an unusually small penis advanced bone maturation an earlier peak height velocity an accelerated rate of growth in regards to height and short final stature due to early epiphyseal closure The incidence of gynecomastia appears to be 100 with 20 of 30 male cases opting for mastectomy according to a review In females symptoms of AEXS include isosexual precocity precocious puberty with phenotypically appropriate secondary sexual characteristics macromastia excessively large breasts an enlarged uterus menstrual irregularities and similarly to males accelerated bone maturation and short final height Of seven females described in one report three 43 had macromastia Pubertal breast hypertrophy in association with AEXS has been described in two young girls Fertility though usually affected to one degree or another especially in males is not always impaired significantly enough to prevent sexual reproduction as evidenced by vertical transmission of the condition by both sexes
Typically the nose is either missing or not functional This deformity called proboscis forms above the center eye and is characteristic of a form of cyclopia called rhinencephaly or rhinocephaly Most such embryos are either naturally aborted or are stillborn upon delivery Although cyclopia is rare several cyclopic human babies are preserved in medical museums e g The Vrolik Museum Amsterdam Trivandrum Medical College Some extreme cases of cyclopia have been documented in farm animals horses sheep pigs and sometimes chickens In such cases the nose and mouth fail to form or the nose grows from the roof of the mouth obstructing airflow and resulting in suffocation shortly after birth
Reye syndrome progresses through five stages Stage I Vasoconstrictive rash on palms of hands and feet Persistent heavy vomiting that is not relieved by not eating Generalized lethargy Confusion Nightmares possible symptom No fever usually present Headaches Stage II Stupor Hyperventilation Fatty liver found on biopsy Hyperactive reflexes Stage III Continuation of Stage I and II symptoms Possible coma Possible cerebral edema Rarely respiratory arrest Stage IV Deepening coma Dilated pupils with minimal response to light Minimal but still present liver dysfunction Stage V Very rapid onset following stage IV Deep coma Seizures Multiple organ failure Flaccidity Hyperammonemia above 300 mg dL of blood Death
Associated with hyperoxia is an increased level of reactive oxygen species ROS which are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen These oxygen containing molecules can damage lipids proteins and nucleic acids and react with surrounding biological tissues The human body has naturally occurring antioxidants to combat reactive molecules but the protective antioxidant defenses can become depleted by abundant reactive oxygen species resulting in oxidation of the tissues and organs The symptoms produced from breathing high concentrations of oxygen for extended periods have been studied in a variety of animals such as frogs turtles pigeons mice rats guinea pigs cats dogs and monkeys The majority of these studies reported the occurrence of irritation congestion and edema of the lungs and even death following prolonged exposures
Symptoms of postpartum blues can vary significantly from one individual to another and from one pregnancy to the next Many symptoms of postpartum blues overlap both with normal symptoms experienced by new parents and with postpartum depression Individuals with postpartum blues have symptoms that are milder and less disruptive to their daily functioning compared to those with postpartum depression Symptoms of postpartum blues include but are not limited to Tearfulness or crying for no reason Mood swings Irritability Anxiety Questioning ones ability to care for the baby Difficulty making choices Loss of appetite Fatigue Difficulty sleeping Difficulty concentrating Negative mood symptoms interspersed with positive symptoms
Painless swelling on the eyelid Eyelid tenderness typically none to mild Increased tearing Heaviness of the eyelid Redness of conjunctiva
For SPB the most common presenting symptom is that of pain in the affected bone Back pain and other consequences of the bone lesion may occur such as spinal cord compression or pathological fracture Around 85 of extramedullary plasmacytoma presents within the upper respiratory tract mucosa causing possible symptoms such as epistaxis rhinorrhoea and nasal obstruction In some tissues it may be found as a palpable mass
Although some cases present with black tarry stool melena the blood loss can be subtle with the anemia symptoms predominating
In terms of the signs symptoms of Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy it is characterized by a decrease in skeletal muscle tone as well as an impairment in brain and eye development Initial symptoms of FCMD present in early infancy as decreased ability to feed Marked differences in facial appearance occur due to decreased muscle tone Further characteristics include Seizures Delay in development Cardiac issues Swallowing difficulty Neurological problemsFukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy also affects the nervous system and various associated parts FCMD affects normal development of the brain producing a broadly smooth bumpy shaped cortex named cobblestone lissencephaly as well as various other malformations notably micropolygyria Children also experience delayed myelination in the brain
The most common symptoms of leptomeningeal cancer is pain and seizures The other symptoms may include headaches usually associated with nausea vomiting light headedness gait difficulties from weakness or ataxia memory problems incontinence sensory abnormalities In some cases symptoms may include double vision numb chin back pain leg weakness sphincter related problems hydrocephalus loss of urine control and difficulty walking Depending on where the tumor cells settle leptomeningeal cancer can cause almost any neurological problem Other symptoms that are less common cranial nerve abnormalities spinal symptoms such as limb weakness and paresthesia and bowel and bladder dysfunction Diplopia is the most common symptom of cranial nerve dysfunction Trigeminal sensory or motor loss cochlear dysfunction and optic neuropathy are also common findings Spinal signs and symptoms include weakness dermatomal or segmental sensory loss and pain in the neck back or following radicular patterns 3 affected domains of neurological function
The MMPI subscale 7 describes psychasthenia as akin to obsessive compulsive disorder and as characterised by excessive doubts compulsions obsessions and unreasonable fears The psychasthenic has an inability to resist specific actions or thoughts regardless of their maladaptive nature In addition to obsessive compulsive features the scale taps abnormal fears self criticism difficulties in concentration and guilt feelings The scale assesses long term trait anxiety although it is somewhat responsive to situational stress as well The psychasthenic has insufficient control over their conscious thinking and memory sometimes wandering aimlessly and or forgetting what they were doing Thoughts can be scattered and take significant effort to organize often resulting in sentences that do not come out as intended therefore making little sense to others The constant mental effort and characteristic insomnia induces fatigue which worsens the condition Symptoms can possibly be greatly reduced with concentration exercises and therapy depending on whether the condition is psychological or biological
Major symptoms are sudden loss of vision partial or complete sudden blurred or foggy vision and pain on movement of the affected eye Early symptoms that require investigation include symptoms from multiple sclerosis twitching lack of coordination slurred speech frequent episodes of partial vision loss or blurred vision episodes of disturbed blackened rather than blurry indicate moderate stage and require immediate medical attention to prevent further loss of vision Other early symptoms are reduced night vision photophobia and red eyes Many patients with optic neuritis may lose some of their color vision in the affected eye especially red with colors appearing subtly washed out compared to the other eye Patients may also experience difficulties judging movement in depth which can be particular troublesome during driving or sport Pulfrich effect Likewise transient worsening of vision with increase of body temperature Uhthoffs phenomenon and glare disability are a frequent complaint However several case studies in children have demonstrated the absence of pain in more than half of cases approximately 60 in their pediatric study population with the most common symptom reported simply as blurriness Other remarkable differences between the presentation of adult optic neuritis as compared to pediatric cases include more often unilateral optic neuritis in adults while children much predominantly present with bilateral involvement On medical examination the head of the optic nerve can easily be visualized by a slit lamp with a high positive lens or by using direct ophthalmoscopy however frequently there is no abnormal appearance of the nerve head in optic neuritis in cases of retrobulbar optic neuritis though it may be swollen in some patients anterior papillitis or more extensive optic neuritis In many cases only one eye is affected and patients may not be aware of the loss of color vision until they are asked to close or cover the healthy eye
Boys with Lowe syndrome are born with cataracts in both eyes glaucoma is present in about half of the individuals with Lowe syndrome though usually not at birth While not present at birth kidney problems develop in many affected boys at about one year of age Renal pathology is characterized by an abnormal loss of certain substances into the urine including bicarbonate sodium potassium amino acids organic acids albumin calcium and L carnitine This problem is known as Fanconi type renal tubular dysfunction
CSF rhinorrhoea involves drainage of cerebrospinal fluid through the nose This appears as a clear colourless liquid Aldroubi sign The liquid in CSF rhinorrhea is thin and clear and an affected person might notice a sweet or salty taste due to the increased glucose and electrolytes present in cerebrospinal fluid so some affected toddlers and young children tend to lick their nose frequently
Symptoms and their severity vary person to person but generally people with OSCS have generalized dysplasia of the distal parts of the long bones cranial sclerosis that is the hardening of bones in the face and head macrocephaly abnormally large head and cleft palate Developmental delay hearing loss congenital heart defects alongside feeding and breathing dyspnea difficulties are common as well although they are not seen in all cases
Historically nephritic syndrome has been characterized by blood in the urine hematuria high blood pressure hypertension decreased urine output 400 ml day oliguria red blood cell casts pyuria and mild to moderate proteinuria If the condition is allowed to progress without treatment it can eventually lead to azotemia and uremic symptoms This constellation of symptoms contrasts with the classical presentation of nephrotic syndrome excessive proteinuria 3 5 g day low plasma albumin levels hypoalbuminemia 3 g L generalized edema and hyperlipidemia Signs and symptoms that are consistent with nephritic syndrome include
Congenital cataracts occur in a variety of morphologic configurations including lamellar polar sutural coronary cerulean nuclear capsular complete membranous
Intracranial hemorrhage is a serious medical emergency because the buildup of blood within the skull can lead to increases in intracranial pressure which can crush delicate brain tissue or limit its blood supply Severe increases in intracranial pressure ICP can cause brain herniation in which parts of the brain are squeezed past structures in the skull
Pretibial myxedema is almost always preceded by the ocular signs found in Graves disease It usually presents itself as a waxy discolored induration of the skin classically described as having a so called peau dorange orange peel appearance on the anterior aspect of the lower legs spreading to the dorsum of the feet or as a non localised non pitting edema of the skin in the same areas In advanced cases this may extend to the upper trunk torso upper extremities face neck back chest and ears The lesions are known to resolve very slowly Application of petroleum jelly on the affected area could relieve the burning sensation and the itching It occasionally occurs in non thyrotoxic Graves disease Hashimotos thyroiditis and stasis dermatitis The serum contains circulating factors which stimulate fibroblasts to increase synthesis of glycosaminoglycans
Individuals with psychotic depression experience the symptoms of a major depressive episode along with one or more psychotic symptoms including delusions and or hallucinations Delusions can be classified as mood congruent or incongruent depending on whether or not the nature of the delusions is in keeping with the individuals mood state Common themes of mood congruent delusions include guilt persecution punishment personal inadequacy or disease Half of patients experience more than one kind of delusion Delusions occur without hallucinations in about one half to two thirds of patients with psychotic depression Hallucinations can be auditory visual olfactory smell or haptic touch and are congruent with delusional material Affect is sad not flat Severe anhedonia loss of interest and psychomotor retardation are typically present
In most affected individuals the condition causes no apparent symptoms asymptomatic or serious effects When renal glycosuria occurs as an isolated finding with otherwise normal kidney function the condition is thought to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait
The disease manifests in young children Symptoms usually begin to appear between two and six years of age Affected infants appear normal although some mild facial dysmorphism may be noticeable Of all of the MPS diseases Sanfilippo syndrome produces the fewest physical abnormalities After an initial symptom free interval patients usually present with a slowing of development and or behavioral problems followed by progressive intellectual decline resulting in severe dementia and progressive motor disease Acquisition of speech is often slow and incomplete The disease progresses to increasing behavioral disturbance including temper tantrums hyperactivity destructiveness aggressive behavior pica difficulties with toilet training and sleep disturbance As affected children initially have normal muscle strength and mobility the behavioral disturbances may be difficult to manage The disordered sleep in particular presents a significant problem to care providers In the final phase of the illness children become increasingly immobile and unresponsive often require wheelchairs and develop swallowing difficulties and seizures The life span of an affected child does not usually extend beyond late teens to early twenties Individuals with MPS type III tend to have mild skeletal abnormalities osteonecrosis of the femoral head may be present in patients with the severe form Optic nerve atrophy deafness and otitis can be seen in moderate to severe individuals Other characteristics include coarse facial features thick lips synophrys and stiff joints It is difficult to clinically distinguish differences among the four types of Sanfilippo syndrome However type A is usually the most severe subtype characterized by earliest onset rapid clinical progression with severe symptoms and short survival The median age of death for children afflicted with type A is 15 4 4 1 years It is important that simple and treatable conditions such as ear infections and toothaches not be overlooked because of behavior problems that make examination difficult Children with MPS type III often have an increased tolerance to pain Bumps bruises or ear infections that would be painful for other children often go unnoticed in children with MPS type III Some children with MPS type III may have a blood clotting problem during and after surgery
L1 syndrome presents as a spectrum ranging from mild to severe features There is a genotype phenotype correlation across the L1 spectrum meaning that the specific genetic variant causing an L1 spectrum disorder in a patient determines the severity of the L1 syndrome in that patient Patients with truncating loss of function variants in L1CAM which prevent the full synthesis of L1 protein experience more severe features than patients with missense variants in L1CAM which may result in an abnormal protein but do not prevent its synthesis Illustrating this difference in L1 syndrome severity up to 50 of infants born with L1 syndrome caused by a truncating mutation will die before the age of 3 years despite provision of best available medical treatment In comparison roughly 10 of infants born with L1 syndrome caused by a missense mutation will die before the age of 3 years Despite its presentation on a continuous spectrum L1 syndrome is loosely divided into four discrete phenotypes
SCA6 is typified by progressive and permanent cerebellar dysfunction These cerebellar signs include ataxia and dysarthria likely caused by cerebellar atrophy Prior to diagnosis and the onset of major symptoms patients often report a feeling of wooziness and momentary imbalance when turning corners or making rapid movements The age at which symptoms first occur varies widely from age 19 to 71 but is typically between 43 and 52 Other major signs of SCA6 are the loss of vibratory and proprioceptive sensation and nystagmus While most patients present with these severe progressive symptoms others sometimes within the same family display episodic non progressive symptoms more similar to episodic ataxia Still others present with symptoms common to both SCA6 and familial hemiplegic migraine
Three quarters of affected patients are asymptomatic However 25 develop cyanosis pneumothorax and show signs of increased breathing difficulty tachypnoea and intercostal retractions At examination they may show hyper resonance at percussion diminished vesicular murmur and an asymmetrical thorax
Signs and symptoms of enteritis are highly variable and vary based on the specific cause and other factors such as individual variance and stage of disease Symptoms may include abdominal pain cramping diarrhea dehydration fever nausea vomiting and weight loss
Nitrogen dioxide poisoning is harmful to all forms of life just like chlorine gas poisoning and carbon monoxide poisoning It is easily absorbed through the lungs and its inhalation can result in heart failure and sometimes death in severe cases Individuals and races may differ in nitrogen dioxide tolerance level and individual tolerance level for the gas may be altered by several factors such as metabolic rate barometric pressure and hematological disorders but significant exposure may result in fatal conditions that could lead to shorter lifespan due to heart failure
Symptoms of cardiac amyloidosis are a combination of heart failure and amyloid deposition in various other organs Amyloid deposition in the heart causes restrictive diastolic heart failure that progresses to systolic heart failure Cardiac manifestations include
The term poliomyelitis is used to identify the disease caused by any of the three serotypes of poliovirus Two basic patterns of polio infection are described a minor illness which does not involve the central nervous system CNS sometimes called abortive poliomyelitis and a major illness involving the CNS which may be paralytic or nonparalytic Adults are more likely to develop symptoms including severe symptoms than children In most people with a normal immune system a poliovirus infection is asymptomatic In about 25 of cases the infection produces minor symptoms which may include sore throat and low fever These symptoms are temporary and full recovery occurs within one or two weeks In about 1 percent of infections the virus can migrate from the gastrointestinal tract into the central nervous system CNS Most patients with CNS involvement develop nonparalytic aseptic meningitis with symptoms of headache neck back abdominal and extremity pain fever vomiting stomach pain lethargy and irritability About one to five in 1000 cases progress to paralytic disease in which the muscles become weak floppy and poorly controlled and finally completely paralyzed this condition is known as acute flaccid paralysis The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head neck and diaphragm Depending on the site of paralysis paralytic poliomyelitis is classified as spinal bulbar or bulbospinal In those who develop paralysis between 2 and 10 percent die as the paralysis affects the breathing muscles Encephalitis an infection of the brain tissue itself can occur in rare cases and is usually restricted to infants It is characterized by confusion changes in mental status headaches fever and less commonly seizures and spastic paralysis
The fourth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM IV TR now replaced by DSM 5 states that a person must exhibit four out of the eight signs and symptoms to meet the diagnostic threshold for ODD These symptoms include
Plasma cell gingivitis appears as mild gingival enlargement and may extend from the free marginal gingiva on to the attached gingiva Sometimes it is blended with a marginal plaque induced gingivitis or it does not involve the free marginal gingiva It may also be found as a solitude red area within the attached gingiva pictures In some cases the healing of a plaque induced gingivitis or a periodontitis resolves a plasma cell gingivitis situated a few mm from the earlier plaque infected marginal gingiva In case of one or few solitary areas of plasma cell gingivitis no symptoms are reported from the patient Most often solitary entities are therefore found by the dentist The gums are red friable or sometimes granular and sometimes bleed easily if traumatised The normal stippling is lost There is not usually any loss of periodontal attachment In a few cases a sore mouth can develop and if so pain is sometimes made worse by toothpastes or hot or spicy food The lesions can extend to involve the palate Plasma cell cheilitis appears as well defined infiltrated dark red plaque with a superficial lacquer like glazing Plasma cell cheilitis usually involves the lower lip The lips appear dry atrophic and fissured Angular cheilitis is sometimes present Where the condition involves the tongue there is an erythematous enlargement with furrows crenation and loss of the normal dorsal tongue coating
The most prominent symptoms of erythromelalgia are episodes of erythema swelling a painful deep aching of the soft tissue usually either radiating or shooting and tenderness along with a painful burning sensation primarily in the extremities These symptoms are often symmetric and affect the lower extremities more frequently than the upper extremities Symptoms may also affect the ears and face For secondary erythromelalgia attacks typically precede and are precipitated by the underlying primary condition For primary erythromelalgia attacks can last from an hour to months at a time and occur infrequently to frequently with multiple times daily Attacks most frequently occur at night thus having the potential to greatly interfere with sleep Common triggers for daytime episodes are exertion heating of the affected extremities and alcohol or caffeine consumption and any pressure applied to the limbs In some patients sugar and even melon consumption have also been known to provoke attacks Many of those with primary erythromelalgia avoid wearing shoes or socks as the heat this generates is known to produce erythromelalgia attacks The coexistence of erythromelalgia and Raynauds phenomenon is rare but case studies of patients with both diagnoses have been reported in medical journals Symptoms may present gradually and incrementally sometimes taking years to become intense enough for patients to seek medical care In other cases symptoms emerge full blown with onset Epidemic erythromelalgia is characterized by burning pain in the toes and soles of the feet accompanied by foot redness congestion and edema a few patients may have fever palpitations headache and joint pain In the 1987 epidemic in Hubei 60 6 of patients had a common cold before the onset of erythromelalgia and 91 2 had pharyngitis
Locked in syndrome is usually characterized by quadriplegia loss of limb function and the inability to speak in otherwise cognitively intact individuals Those with locked in syndrome may be able to communicate with others through coded messages by blinking or moving their eyes which are often not affected by the paralysis The symptoms are similar to those of sleep paralysis Patients who have locked in syndrome are conscious and aware with no loss of cognitive function They can sometimes retain proprioception and sensation throughout their bodies Some patients may have the ability to move certain facial muscles and most often some or all of the extraocular muscles Individuals with the syndrome lack coordination between breathing and voice This prevents them from producing voluntary sounds though the vocal cords themselves may not be paralysed
Although there are many possible symptoms associated with PVCs PVCs may also have no symptoms at all PVCs may be perceived as a skipped heart beat a strong beat palpitations or lightheadedness They may also cause chest pain a faint feeling fatigue or hyperventilation after exercise Symptoms may be more pronounced at times of stress Women may be more aware of PVCs at the time of the menstrual period Premature ventricular contractions may be associated with underlying heart disease and certain characteristics are therefore elicited routinely the presence of signs of heart disease or a known history of heart disease e g previous myocardial infarction as well as heart disease or sudden cardiac death in close relatives PVCs and palpitation associated with syncope transient loss of consciousness or provoked by exertion are also concerning Physical examination is focused on identifying evidence of underlying heart disease
Signs and symptoms of ACC and other callosal disorders vary greatly among individuals However some characteristics common in individuals with callosal disorders include vision impairments low muscle tone hypotonia poor motor coordination delays in motor milestones such as sitting and walking delayed toilet training and dysautonomic symptoms such as low perception of pain or chewing and swallowing difficulties Laboratory research has demonstrated that individuals with ACC have difficulty transferring more complex information from one hemisphere to the other They also have been shown to have some cognitive disabilities difficulty in complex problem solving and social difficulties missing subtle social cues even when their intelligence quotient is normal Recent research suggests that specific social difficulties may be a result of impaired face processing The unusual social behavior in childhood often resembles that of an autism spectrum disorder Other characteristics sometimes associated with callosal disorders include seizures spasticity early feeding difficulties and or gastric reflux hearing impairments abnormal head and facial features and intellectual disability
Although these blocking antibodies may be confined to one of the larger muscles responsible for moving the face or appendages or for breathing about 90 of MG patients eventually have eye involvement The most common symptoms are double vision diplopia and eyelid drooping ptosis whereas the pupil is always spared Diplopia occurs when MG affects a single extraocular muscle in one eye limiting eye movement and leading to double vision when the eye is turned toward the affected muscle Ptosis occurs when the levator palpebrae superioris the muscle responsible for eyelid elevation is affected on one or both sides leading to eyelid drooping Although these symptoms may not be readily apparent in well rested patients weakness can usually be induced with exercise of the commonly affected muscles e g by having the patient look upward for about 60 seconds In 75 of MG cases the initial manifestation is in the eye Within 2 years 80 of patients with ocular onset of MG will progress to involve other muscle groups thereby developing generalized MG If MG is confined to the ocular muscles for more than 3 years there is a 94 likelihood that the symptoms will not worsen or generalize Aside from asymmetric ptosis which becomes worse with fatigue sustained upgaze and at the end of the day and variable limitation of extraocular muscles diplopia other clinical signs of ocular MG include gaze evoked nystagmus rapid involuntary oscillatory motion of the eyeball and Cogan s lid twitch upper lid twitch present when patient looks straight ahead after looking down for 10 15 seconds
The presentation of mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency may begin during infancy features that occur are low blood sugar weak muscle tone and liver problems Infants with this disorder are at risk for heart problems breathing difficulties and pigmentary retinopathy Signs and symptoms of mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency that may begin after infancy include hypotonia muscle pain a breakdown of muscle tissue and a loss of sensation in the extremities called peripheral neuropathy Some who have MTP deficiency show a progressive course associated with myopathy and recurrent rhabdomyolysis
The hearing loss of Pendred syndrome is often although not always present from birth and language acquisition may be a significant problem if deafness is severe in childhood The hearing loss typically worsens over the years and progression can be step wise and related to minor head trauma In some cases language development worsens after head injury demonstrating that the inner ear is sensitive to trauma in Pendred syndrome this is as a consequence of the widened vestibular aqueducts usual in this syndrome Vestibular function varies in Pendred syndrome and vertigo can be a feature of minor head trauma A goitre is present in 75 of all cases
The onset of ORS may be sudden where it usually follows after a precipitating event or gradual
An alternative name of the condition LEOPARD syndrome is a mnemonic originally coined in 1969 as the condition is characterized by some of the following seven conditions the first letters of which spell LEOPARD along with the characteristic freckling of the skin caused by the lentigines that is reminiscent of the large cat
Symptoms typically begin 10 14 days after exposure The classic symptoms include a four day fever the 4 Ds and the three Cs cough coryza head cold fever sneezing and conjunctivitis red eyes along with a maculopapular rash Fever is common and typically lasts for about one week the fever seen with measles is often as high as 40 C 104 F Kopliks spots seen inside the mouth are diagnostic for measles but are temporary and therefore rarely seen Koplik spots are small white spots that are commonly seen on the inside of the cheeks opposite the molars They appear as grains of salt on a reddish background Recognizing these spots before a person reaches their maximum infectiousness can help reduce the spread of the disease The characteristic measles rash is classically described as a generalized red maculopapular rash that begins several days after the fever starts It starts on the back of the ears and after a few hours spreads to the head and neck before spreading to cover most of the body often causing itching The measles rash appears two to four days after the initial symptoms and lasts for up to eight days The rash is said to stain changing color from red to dark brown before disappearing Overall measles usually resolves after about three weeks People who have been vaccinated against measles but have incomplete protective immunity may experience a form of modified measles Modified measles is characterized by a prolonged incubation period milder and less characteristic symptoms sparse and discrete rash of short duration
OPCA is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia leading to clumsiness in body movements veering from midline when walking wide based stance and falls without signs of paralysis or weakness Clinical presentation can vary greatly between patients but mostly affects speech balance and walking Other possible neurological problems include spasmodic dysphonia hypertonia hyperreflexia rigidity dysarthria dysphagia and neck dystonic posture
Signs and symptoms of Huntingtons disease most commonly become noticeable between the ages of 30 and 50 years but they can begin at any age and present as a triad of motor cognitive and psychiatric symptoms In 50 of cases the psychiatric symptoms appear first Their progression is often described in early stages middle stages and late stages with an earlier prodromal phase In the early stages subtle personality changes problems in cognition and physical skills irritability and mood swings occur all of which may go unnoticed and these usually precede the motor symptoms Almost everyone with HD eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms but the onset progression and extent of cognitive and behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals The most characteristic initial physical symptoms are jerky random and uncontrollable movements called chorea Many people are not aware of their involuntary movements or impeded by them Chorea may be initially exhibited as general restlessness small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions lack of coordination or slowed saccadic eye movements These minor motor abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of motor dysfunction by at least three years The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity writhing motions or abnormal posturing appear as the disorder progresses These are signs that the system in the brain that is responsible for movement has been affected Psychomotor functions become increasingly impaired such that any action that requires muscle control is affected Common consequences are physical instability abnormal facial expression and difficulties chewing swallowing and speaking Sleep disturbances and weight loss are also associated symptoms Eating difficulties commonly cause weight loss and may lead to malnutrition Juvenile HD generally progresses at a faster rate with greater cognitive decline and chorea is exhibited briefly if at all the Westphal variant of slowness of movement rigidity and tremors is more typical in juvenile HD as are seizures Cognitive abilities are progressively impaired and tend to generally decline into dementia Especially affected are executive functions which include planning cognitive flexibility abstract thinking rule acquisition initiation of appropriate actions and inhibition of inappropriate actions As the disease progresses memory deficits tend to appear Reported impairments range from short term memory deficits to long term memory difficulties including deficits in episodic memory of ones life procedural memory of the body of how to perform an activity and working memory Reported neuropsychiatric signs are anxiety depression a reduced display of emotions egocentrism aggression and compulsive behavior the latter of which can cause or worsen addictions including alcoholism gambling and hypersexuality Difficulties in recognizing other peoples negative expressions have also been observed The prevalence of these symptoms is highly variable between studies with estimated rates for lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders between 33 and 76 For many with the disease and their families these symptoms are among the most distressing aspects of the disease often affecting daily functioning and constituting reason for institutionalization Early behavioral changes in HD result in an increased risk of suicide Often individuals have reduced awareness of chorea cognitive and emotional impairments Mutant huntingtin is expressed throughout the body and associated with abnormalities in peripheral tissues that are directly caused by such expression outside the brain These abnormalities include muscle atrophy cardiac failure impaired glucose tolerance weight loss osteoporosis and testicular atrophy
The most common symptoms in children are easy bruising pale skin fever and an enlarged spleen or liver Damage to the bone marrow by way of displacing the normal bone marrow cells with higher numbers of immature white blood cells results in a lack of blood platelets which are important in the blood clotting process This means people with leukemia may easily become bruised bleed excessively or develop pinprick bleeds petechiae White blood cells which are involved in fighting pathogens may be suppressed or dysfunctional This could cause the persons immune system to be unable to fight off a simple infection or to start attacking other body cells Because leukemia prevents the immune system from working normally some people experience frequent infection ranging from infected tonsils sores in the mouth or diarrhea to life threatening pneumonia or opportunistic infections Finally the red blood cell deficiency leads to anemia which may cause dyspnea and pallor Some people experience other symptoms such as fevers chills night sweats weakness in the limbs feeling fatigued and other common flu like symptoms Some people experience nausea or a feeling of fullness due to an enlarged liver and spleen this can result in unintentional weight loss Blasts affected by the disease may come together and become swollen in the liver or in the lymph nodes causing pain and leading to nausea If the leukemic cells invade the central nervous system then neurological symptoms notably headaches can occur Uncommon neurological symptoms like migraines seizures or coma can occur as a result of brain stem pressure All symptoms associated with leukemia can be attributed to other diseases Consequently leukemia is always diagnosed through medical tests The word leukemia which means white blood is derived from the characteristic high white blood cell count that presents in most affected people before treatment The high number of white blood cells is apparent when a blood sample is viewed under a microscope with the extra white blood cells frequently being immature or dysfunctional The excessive number of cells can also interfere with the level of other cells causing further harmful imbalance in the blood count Some people diagnosed with leukemia do not have high white blood cell counts visible during a regular blood count This less common condition is called aleukemia The bone marrow still contains cancerous white blood cells that disrupt the normal production of blood cells but they remain in the marrow instead of entering the bloodstream where they would be visible in a blood test For a person with aleukemia the white blood cell counts in the bloodstream can be normal or low Aleukemia can occur in any of the four major types of leukemia and is particularly common in hairy cell leukemia
The various non allergic NSAID hypersensitivity syndromes affect 0 5 1 9 of the general population with AERD affecting about 7 of all asthmatics and about 14 of adults with severe asthma AERD which is slightly more prevalent in women usually begins in young adulthood twenties and thirties are the most common onset times although children are affected by it and present a diagnostic problem in pediatrics and may not include any other allergies Most commonly the first symptom is rhinitis inflammation or irritation of the nasal mucosa which may manifest as sneezing runny nose or congestion The disorder typically progresses to asthma then nasal polyposis with aspirin sensitivity coming last Anosmia lack of smell also is common as inflammation within the nose and sinuses likely reaches the olfactory receptors The respiratory reactions to NSAIDs vary in severity ranging from mild nasal congestion and eye watering to lower respiratory symptoms including wheezing coughing an asthma attack and in rare cases anaphylaxis In addition to the typical respiratory reactions about 10 of patients with AERD manifest skin symptoms such as urticaria and or gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain or vomiting during their reactions to aspirin In addition to aspirin patients also react to other NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and to any medication that inhibits the cyclooxygenase 1 COX 1 enzyme although paracetamol acetaminophen in low doses is generally considered safe NSAIDs that are highly selective in blocking COX 2 and do not block its closely related paralog COX 1 such as the COX 2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib also are regarded as safe Nonetheless recent studies do find that these types of drugs e g acetaminophen and celecoxib may trigger adverse reactions in these patients caution is recommended in using any COX inhibitors In addition to aspirin and NSAIDs consumption of even small amounts of alcohol also produces uncomfortable respiratory reactions in many patients
Symptoms and signs include abdominal discomfort polyuria polydipsia incidental discovery of hypertension and abdominal mass The classic presentation for ARPKD is systemic hypertension with progression to end stage kidney disease ESKD by the age of 15 In a typical presentation a small number of individuals with ARPKD live to adulthood with some kidney function but with significant deterioration in liver function This outcome is postulated to result from expression of the polycystic kidney and hepatic disease gene PKHD1 which is located on chromosome 6p In severe cases a fetus will present with oligohydramnios and as a result may present with Potter sequence
As with other cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes individuals affected with AGAT deficiency are intellectually disabled and can have seizures They can often have muscle weakness These symptoms are caused by the lack of creatine in skeletal muscles and in the brain AGAT deficiency was first identified in 2000 in a pair of sisters aged 4 and 6 Both sisters had severe intellectual disability
The main symptoms of ADA deficiency are pneumonia chronic diarrhea and widespread skin rashes Affected children also grow much more slowly than healthy children and some have developmental delay Most individuals with ADA deficiency are diagnosed with SCID in the first 6 months of life An association with polyarteritis nodosa has been reported
It involves numerous anomalies including
Lack of motor function but not paralysis Lack of speech Apathy Slowness Disinhibition
Most patients with hypertensive retinopathy have no symptoms However some may report decreased or blurred vision and headaches
Although hypercholesterolemia itself is asymptomatic longstanding elevation of serum cholesterol can lead to atherosclerosis hardening of arteries Over a period of decades elevated serum cholesterol contributes to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arteries This can lead to progressive narrowing of the involved arteries Alternatively smaller plaques may rupture and cause a clot to form and obstruct blood flow A sudden blockage of a coronary artery may result in a heart attack A blockage of an artery supplying the brain can cause a stroke If the development of the stenosis or occlusion is gradual blood supply to the tissues and organs slowly diminishes until organ function becomes impaired At this point tissue ischemia restriction in blood supply may manifest as specific symptoms For example temporary ischemia of the brain commonly referred to as a transient ischemic attack may manifest as temporary loss of vision dizziness and impairment of balance difficulty speaking weakness or numbness or tingling usually on one side of the body Insufficient blood supply to the heart may cause chest pain and ischemia of the eye may manifest as transient visual loss in one eye Insufficient blood supply to the legs may manifest as calf pain when walking while in the intestines it may present as abdominal pain after eating a meal Some types of hypercholesterolemia lead to specific physical findings For example familial hypercholesterolemia Type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia may be associated with xanthelasma palpebrarum yellowish patches underneath the skin around the eyelids arcus senilis white or gray discoloration of the peripheral cornea and xanthomata deposition of yellowish cholesterol rich material of the tendons especially of the fingers Type III hyperlipidemia may be associated with xanthomata of the palms knees and elbows
A certain degree of curvature of the penis is considered normal as many people are born with this benign condition commonly referred to as congenital curvature The disease may cause pain hardened big cord like lesions scar tissue known as plaques or abnormal curvature of the penis when erect due to chronic inflammation of the tunica albuginea CITA Although the popular conception of Peyronies disease is that it always involves curvature of the penis the scar tissue sometimes causes divots or indentations rather than curvature The condition may also make sexual intercourse painful and or difficult though it is unclear whether some men report satisfactory or unsatisfactory intercourse in spite of the disorder The disorder is confined to the penis although a substantial number of men with Peyronies exhibit concurrent connective tissue disorders in the hand and to a lesser degree in the feet About 30 percent of men with Peyronies disease develop fibrosis in other elastic tissues of the body such as on the hand or foot including Dupuytrens contracture of the hand An increased incidence in genetically related males suggests a genetic component It can affect men of any race and age
The failure of the metanephros to develop in cases of BRA and some cases involving unilateral renal agenesis URA is due primarily to the failure of the mesonephric duct to produce a ureteric bud capable of inducing the metanephric mesenchyme The failed induction will thereby cause the subsequent degeneration of the metanephros by apoptosis and other mechanisms The mesonephric duct s of the agenic kidney s will also degenerate and fail to connect with the bladder Therefore the means by which the fetus produces urine and transports it to the bladder for excretion into the amniotic sac has been severely compromised in the cases of URA or completely eliminated in the cases of BRA The decreased volume of amniotic fluid causes the growing fetus to become compressed by the mothers uterus This compression can cause many physical deformities of the fetus most common of which is Potter facies Lower extremity anomalies are frequent in these cases which often presents with clubbed feet and or bowing of the legs Sirenomelia or Mermaid syndrome which occurs approximately in 1 45 000 births can also present In fact nearly all reported cases of sirenomelia also present with BRA It is associated with childhood polycystic kidney disease which is autosomal recessive in origin Other anomalies of the classic Potter sequence infant include a parrot beak nose redundant skin and the most common characteristic of infants with BRA which is a skin fold of tissue extending from the medial canthus across the cheek The ears are slightly low and pressed against the head making them appear large The adrenal glands often appear as small oval discs pressed against the posterior abdomen due to the absence of upward renal pressure The bladder is often small nondistensible and may be filled with a minute amount of fluid In males the vas deferens and seminal vesicles may be absent while in females the uterus and upper vagina may be absent Other abnormalities include anal atresia absence of the rectum and sigmoid colon esophageal and duodenal atresia and a single umbilical artery Presence of a diaphragmatic hernia is also common in these fetuses infants Additionally the alveolar sacs of the lungs fail to properly develop as a result of the reduced volume of amniotic fluid Labor is often induced between 22 and 36 weeks of gestation however some of these pregnancies may go to term and unaborted infants typically survive for only a few minutes to a few hours These infants will eventually die as either a result of pulmonary hypoplasia or renal failure
Acute
There are a number of symptoms associated with monoplegia Curling of the hands or stiffness of the feet weakness spasticity numbness paralysis pain in the affected limb headaches and shoulder pain are all considered to be symptoms of monoplegia Patients of monoplegia typically feel symptoms of weakness and loss of sensation in the affected extremity usually an arm Despite these symptoms the extremity with paralysis continues to maintain a strong pulse While chronic progressive brachial monoplegia is uncommon syringomyelia and tumors of the cervical cord or brachial plexus may be the cause The onset of brachial plexus paralysis is usually explosive where pain is the initial feature Pain localizes to the shoulder but may be more diffuse or could be limited to the lower arm Pain is severe and often described as sharp stabbing throbbing or aching The duration of pain which is constant varies from a span of several hours to 3 weeks As the pain subsides weakness usually appears In addition chronicle progressive weakness of one leg suggests a tumor of the spinal cord of the lumbar plexus Fever is often the first symptom of lumbar plexus paralysis followed by pain in one or both legs The pain has an abrupt onset and may occur in a femoral or sciatic distribution Weakness may develop concurrently with pain or be delayed for as long as 3 weeks Furthermore a monomeric form of spinal muscular atrophy affecting only one leg or arm should be considered when progressive weakness is not accompanied by sensory loss
Individuals with A1AD may develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease emphysema during their thirties or forties even without a history of smoking though smoking greatly increases the risk Symptoms may include shortness of breath on exertion and later at rest wheezing and sputum production Symptoms may resemble recurrent respiratory infections or asthma A1AD may cause several manifestations associated with liver disease which include impaired liver function and cirrhosis In newborns alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency can result in early onset jaundice followed by prolonged jaundice Between 3 and 5 of children with ZZ mutations develop life threatening liver disease including liver failure A1AD is a leading reason for liver transplantation in newborns In newborns and children A1AD may cause jaundice poor feeding poor weight gain hepatomegaly and splenomegaly
Sinus pericranii typically present as soft palpable masses along midline skull which may fluctuate in size depending on body positioning Classically these lesions are not associated with color change of the overlying skin such as with other vascular lesions such as hemangioma
Hives or urticaria is a form of skin rash with red raised itchy bumps They may also burn or sting Welts raised areas surrounded by a red base from hives can appear anywhere on the surface of the skin Whether the trigger is allergic or not a complex release of inflammatory mediators including histamine from cutaneous mast cells results in fluid leakage from superficial blood vessels Welts may be pinpoint in size or several inches in diameter Often the patches of rash move around About 20 of people are affected Cases of short duration occur equally in males and females lasting a few days and without leaving any long lasting skin changes Cases of long duration are more common in females Cases of short duration are more common among children while cases of long duration are more common among those who are middle aged Fewer than 5 of cases last for more than six weeks The condition frequently recurs In half of cases of hives the cause remains unknown Angioedema is a related condition also from allergic and nonallergic causes though fluid leakage is from much deeper blood vessels in the subcutaneous or submucosal layers Individual hives that are painful last more than 24 hours or leave a bruise as they heal are more likely to be a more serious condition called urticarial vasculitis Hives caused by stroking the skin often linear in appearance are due to a benign condition called dermatographic urticaria
The symptoms and signs of hypertensive heart disease will depend on whether or not it is accompanied by heart failure In the absence of heart failure hypertension with or without enlargement of the heart left ventricular hypertrophy is usually symptomless Symptoms signs and consequences of congestive heart failure can include
One common symptom of respiratory arrest is cyanosis a bluish discoloration of the skin resulting from an inadequate amount of oxygen in the blood If respiratory arrest remains without any treatment cardiac arrest will occur within minutes of hypoxemia hypercapnia or both At this point patients will be unconscious or about to become unconscious Symptoms of respiratory compromise can differ with each patient Complications from respiratory compromise are increasing rapidly across the clinical spectrum partly due to expanded use of opioids combined with the lack of standardized guidelines among medical specialties While respiratory compromise creates problems that are often serious and potentially life threatening they may be prevented with the proper tools and approach Appropriate patient monitoring and therapeutic strategies are necessary for early recognition intervention and treatment
The initial main symptom in MG is painless weakness of specific muscles not fatigue The muscle weakness becomes progressively worse during periods of physical activity and improves after periods of rest Typically the weakness and fatigue are worse toward the end of the day MG generally starts with ocular eye weakness it might then progress to a more severe generalized form characterized by weakness in the extremities or in muscles that govern basic life functions
Symptoms of AVM vary according to the location of the malformation Roughly 88 of people with an AVM are asymptomatic often the malformation is discovered as part of an autopsy or during treatment of an unrelated disorder called in medicine an incidental finding in rare cases its expansion or a micro bleed from an AVM in the brain can cause epilepsy neurological deficit or pain The most general symptoms of a cerebral AVM include headaches and epileptic seizures with more specific symptoms occurring that normally depend on the location of the malformation and the individual Such possible symptoms include Difficulties with movement coordination including muscle weakness and even paralysis Vertigo dizziness Difficulties of speech dysarthria and communication such as aphasia Difficulties with everyday activities such as apraxia Abnormal sensations numbness tingling or spontaneous pain Memory and thought related problems such as confusion dementia or hallucinations Cerebral AVMs may present themselves in a number of different ways
Sprains A sprain is a type of acute injury which results from the stretching or tearing of a ligament Depending on the severity of the sprain the movement on the joint can be compromised since ligaments aid in the stability and support of joints Sprains are commonly seen in vulnerable areas such as the wrists knees and ankles They can occur from movements such as falling on an outstretched hand or a twisting of the ankle or foot The severity of a sprain can be classified
Symptoms and signs in the newborn can be sepsis abdominal mass and respiratory distress Other abdominopelvic or perineal congenital anomalies frequently prompt radiographic evaluation in the newborn resulting in a diagnosis of coincident vaginal atresia Symptoms for vaginal atresia include cyclical abdominal pain the inability to start having menstrual cycles a small pouch or dimple where a vaginal opening should be and pelvic mass when the upper vagina becomes filled with menstrual blood Signs and symptoms of vaginal atresia or vaginal agenesis can often go unnoticed in females until they reach the age of menstruation Women may also experience some form of abdominal pain or cramping
By definition all limb girdle muscular dystrophies LGMD cause progressive proximal weakness meaning weakness of the muscles on or close to the torso that worsens over time Explicitly LGMD preferentially affects muscles of the hip girdle thigh shoulder girdle and or upper arm The muscle weakness is generally symmetric Usually the hip girdle is the first area to exhibit weakness manifesting as difficulty walking going up and or down stairs rising from a chair bending at the waist or squatting Because of these difficulties falling can occur frequently Weakness of the shoulder girdle can make lifting objects or even elevating the arms difficult or impossible Rate of progression varies between patients Eventually the abilities to run and walk can deteriorate The disease commonly leads to dependence on a wheelchair within years of symptom onset although some patients maintain mobility Eventually the disease can affect other muscles such as the ones located in the face By definition LGMDs primarily affect skeletal muscles although cardiac muscle can be affected to a lesser degree in select subtypes which can cause palpitations There can be significant variability in disease features and severity between LGMD subtypes and even within any given LGMD subtype Additional possible presentations include
Classically it is described in male patients as a triad of the following signs and symptoms claudication of the buttocks and thighs absent or decreased femoral pulses erectile dysfunctionThis combination is known as Leriche syndrome However any number of symptoms may present depending on the distribution and severity of the disease such as muscle atrophy slow wound healing in the legs and critical limb ischemia
PPPs are small bumps on the human penis They vary in size from 1 4 mm are pearly or flesh colored smooth and dome topped or filiform and appear in one or several rows around the corona the ridge of the glans and sometimes on the penile shaft They are painless non cancerous and not harmful
Symptoms include fever sore throat painful swallowing and swelling in the neck An anterior space abscess can cause lockjaw spasm of jaw muscle and hard mass formation along the angle of the mandible with medial bulging of the tonsil and lateral pharyngeal wall A posterior space abscess causes swelling in the posterior pharyngeal wall and lockjaw is minimal Other structures within the carotid sheath may be involved causing rigors high fever bacteremia neurologic deficit or a massive haemorrhage caused by carotid artery rupture
Romano Ward syndrome increases the risk of abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias These are typically a form of ventricular tachycardia known as Torsades de pointes which can cause faints seizures or even sudden death Less dangerous arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation also occur causing symptoms of heart racing or palpitations However many of those with Romano Ward syndrome will remain free from arrhythmias and therefore free from symptoms Certain situations are more likely to precipitate arrhythmias such as exercise or mental stress in the LQT1 subtype sudden loud noise in the LQT2 subtype and during sleep or immediately upon waking in the LQT3 subtype Romano Ward syndrome can be differentiated from other forms of long QT syndrome by Romano Wards sole involvement of the heart While other forms of long QT syndrome are associated with deafness Jervell and Lange Nielsen syndrome intermittent weakness and bone abormailities LQT7 Andersen Tawil syndrome and autism spectrum disorder LQT8 Timothy syndrome these extra cardiac manifestations are not seen in Romano Ward
Pre eruptive phase The first signs of erythema nodosum are often flu like symptoms such as a fever cough malaise and aching joints Some people also experience stiffness or swelling in the joints and weight loss
Mild ascites is hard to notice but severe ascites leads to abdominal distension People with ascites generally will complain of progressive abdominal heaviness and pressure as well as shortness of breath due to mechanical impingement on the diaphragm Ascites is detected with physical examination of the abdomen by visible bulging of the flanks in the reclining person flank bulging shifting dullness difference in percussion note in the flanks that shifts when the person is turned on the side or in massive ascites with a fluid thrill or fluid wave tapping or pushing on one side will generate a wave like effect through the fluid that can be felt in the opposite side of the abdomen Other signs of ascites may be present due to its underlying cause For instance in portal hypertension perhaps due to cirrhosis or fibrosis of the liver people may also complain of leg swelling bruising gynecomastia hematemesis or mental changes due to encephalopathy Those with ascites due to cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis may complain of chronic fatigue or weight loss Those with ascites due to heart failure may also complain of shortness of breath as well as wheezing and exercise intolerance
One of the symptoms of conduct disorder is a lower level of fear Research performed on the impact of toddlers exposed to fear and distress shows that negative emotionality fear predicts toddlers empathy related response to distress The findings support that if a caregiver is able to respond to infant cues the toddler has a better ability to respond to fear and distress If a child does not learn how to handle fear or distress the child will be more likely to lash out at other children If the caregiver is able to provide therapeutic intervention teaching children at risk better empathy skills the child will have a lower incident level of conduct disorder Increased instances of violent and antisocial behavior are also associated with the condition examples may range from pushing hitting and biting when the child is young progressing towards beating and inflicted cruelty as the child becomes older Conduct disorder can present with limited prosocial emotions lack of remorse or guilt lack of empathy lack of concern for performance and shallow or deficient affect Symptoms vary by individual but the four main groups of symptoms are described below
Infants with the disorder exhibit an inverted smile they appear to be crying when they are actually smiling in conjunction with uropathy They also may be affected by hydronephrosis Symptoms of this disease can start at very young ages Many people with this syndrome will die in their teens to early 20s because of the renal failure uropathy if not diagnosed and treated Children with the syndrome have abnormal facial development that cause an inverted smile nerve connections are however normal When attempting to smile the child will appear to cry Urinary problems arise as a result of a neurogenic bladder Most patients older than the age of toilet training present with enuresis urinary tract infection hydronephrosis and a spectrum of radiological abnormalities typical of obstructive or neurogenic bladders Radiological abnormalities include things such as trabeculated bladder vesicoureteral reflex external sphincter spasm pyelonephritis hyperreflexic bladder noninhibited detrusor contraction etc Urinary abnormalities might result in renal deterioration and failure This can be prevented by taking proper measures to restore normal micturition and by taking antibiotics to prevent infections In some cases the affected patients become hypertensive and progress to end stage renal disease while others become uremic Additionally most patients suffer from constipation Early detection of this syndrome is possible through the peculiar faces that children present
Although often asymptomatic the most common presenting symptom of patients with a horseshoe kidney is abdominal or flank pain However presentation is often non specific Approximately a third of patients with horseshoe kidneys remain asymptomatic throughout their entire life with over 50 of patients having no medical issues related to their renal fusion when followed for a 25 year period As a result it is estimated that approximately 25 of patients with horseshoe kidneys are diagnosed incidentally with ultrasound or CT imaging
Myringosclerosis rarely causes any symptoms Tympanosclerosis on the other hand can cause significant hearing loss or chalky white patches on the middle ear or tympanic membrane
Some common symptoms and signs of mastoiditis include pain tenderness and swelling in the mastoid region There may be ear pain otalgia and the ear or mastoid region may be red erythematous Fever or headaches may also be present Infants usually show nonspecific symptoms including anorexia diarrhea or irritability Drainage from the ear occurs in more serious cases often manifest as brown discharge on the pillowcase upon waking
The experience of amaurosis fugax is classically described as a temporary loss of vision in one or both eyes that appears as a black curtain coming down vertically into the field of vision in one eye however this altitudinal visual loss is relatively uncommon In one study only 23 8 percent of patients with transient monocular vision loss experienced the classic curtain or shade descending over their vision Other descriptions of this experience include a monocular blindness dimming fogging or blurring Total or sectorial vision loss typically lasts only a few seconds but may last minutes or even hours Duration depends on the cause of the vision loss Obscured vision due to papilledema may last only seconds while a severely atherosclerotic carotid artery may be associated with a duration of one to ten minutes Certainly additional symptoms may be present with the amaurosis fugax and those findings will depend on the cause of the transient monocular vision loss
Vibrio vulnificus is an extremely virulent bacterium that can cause three types of infections
Ten percent of patients present with splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy Some patients report a varying degree of fatigue consistent with a chronic fatigue syndrome or postviral fatigue as seen in EBV infections while others remain asymptomatic
Most cases of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia are asymptomatic Laboratory signs of FHH include High blood levels of calcium hypercalcemia A low amount of calcium excreted in the urine Ca excretion rate 0 02 mmol L High blood levels of magnesium hypermagnesemia High normal to mildly elevated parathyroid hormone
Primary hyperoxaluria is an autosomal recessive disease meaning both copies of the gene contain the mutation Both parents must have one copy of this mutated gene to pass it on to their child but they do not typically show signs or symptoms of the disease A single kidney stone in children or recurrent stones in adults is often the first warning sign of primary hyperoxaluria Other symptoms range from recurrent urinary tract infections severe abdominal pain or pain in the side blood in the urine to chronic kidney disease and kidney failure The age of symptom onset progression and severity can vary greatly from one person to another even among members of the same family Some individuals may have mild cases that go undiagnosed well into adulthood others may develop severe complications during infancy which may result in early death
Symptoms vary from person to person and may come and go Almost everyone with lupus has joint pain and swelling Some develop arthritis Frequently affected joints are the fingers hands wrists and knees Other common symptoms include
An episode of SVT may present with palpitations dizziness shortness of breath or losing consciousness fainting The electrocardiogram ECG would appear as a narrow complex SVT Between episodes of tachycardia the affected person is likely to be asymptomatic however the ECG would demonstrate the classic delta wave in Wolff Parkinson White syndrome
The main consequence of impaired ciliary function is reduced or absent mucus clearance from the lungs and susceptibility to chronic recurrent respiratory infections including sinusitis bronchitis pneumonia and otitis media Progressive damage to the respiratory system is common including progressive bronchiectasis beginning in early childhood and sinus disease sometimes becoming severe in adults However diagnosis is often missed early in life despite the characteristic signs and symptoms In males immotility of sperm can lead to infertility although conception remains possible through the use of in vitro fertilization there also are reported cases where sperm were able to move Trials have also shown that there is a marked reduction in fertility in females with Kartageners syndrome due to dysfunction of the oviductal cilia Many affected individuals experience hearing loss and show symptoms of otitis media which demonstrates variable responsiveness to the insertion of myringotomy tubes or grommets Some patients have a poor sense of smell which is believed to accompany high mucus production in the sinuses although others report normal or even acute sensitivity to smell and taste Clinical progression of the disease is variable with lung transplantation required in severe cases Susceptibility to infections can be drastically reduced by an early diagnosis Treatment with various chest physiotherapy techniques has been observed to reduce the incidence of lung infection and to slow the progression of bronchiectasis dramatically Aggressive treatment of sinus disease beginning at an early age is believed to slow long term sinus damage although this has not yet been adequately documented Aggressive measures to enhance clearance of mucus prevent respiratory infections and treat bacterial superinfections have been observed to slow lung disease progression Although the true incidence of the disease is unknown it is estimated to be 1 in 32 000 although the actual incidence may be as high as 1 in 15 000
Males show more serious symptoms than females affected by this disorder The symptoms for males are
CNE is a necrotizing inflammation of the small bowel especially the jejunum but also the ileum Clinical results may vary from mild diarrhea to a life threatening sequence of severe abdominal pain vomiting often bloody bloody stool ulceration of the small intestine with leakage perforation into the peritoneal cavity and possible death within a single day due to peritonitis Many patients exhibit meteorism swelling of the abdomen due to excess gas and fever Fluid can enter the peritoneum Sepsis can occur with one case having 28 500 white blood cells per cubic milliliter

Individuals with IH share common symptoms like excessive daytime sleepiness sleep inertia brain fog long sleep periods and others Excessive daytime sleepiness characterized by persistent sleepiness throughout the day and often a general lack of energy even during the day after apparently adequate or even prolonged nighttime sleep People with EDS nap repeatedly throughout the day and have strong urges to sleep while driving working eating or conversing with others Sleep inertia also known as sleep drunkenness characterized by having extreme difficulty waking up and feeling an uncontrollable desire to go back to sleep Clouding of consciousness characterized by inattention thought process abnormalities comprehension abnormalities and language abnormalities These symptoms may affect performance on perception memory learning executive functions language constructive abilities voluntary motor control attention and mental speed Affected individuals can complain of forgetfulness confusion or inability to think clearly Excessive sleep 9 hours or more over a full 24 hour period without feeling refreshed after waking Daytime naps can be up to several hours and are also unrefreshing Some studies have shown increased frequencies of palpitations digestive problems difficulty with body temperature regulation and other symptoms in patients with IH Anxiety and depression are frequent likely as a response to chronic illness A case series in 2010 found that peripheral vascular symptoms such as cold hands and feet e g Raynaud Syndrome were more common in people with IH than in controls Other autonomic dysfunctional symptoms such as fainting episodes dizziness upon arising headaches possibly migrainous in quality food cravings and impotence may also be correlated with IH Researchers have found that people reporting IH symptoms report high levels of autonomic dysfunction on par with other conditions of autonomic failure i e MSA and diabetes As of June 2021 there is no evidence to suggest such symptoms are related to IH in any way
Thyroglossal duct cysts most often present with a palpable asymptomatic midline neck mass usually below 65 of the time the level of the hyoid bone The mass on the neck moves during swallowing or on protrusion of the tongue because of its attachment to the tongue via the tract of thyroid descent Some patients will have neck or throat pain or dysphagia The persistent duct or sinus can promote oral secretions which may cause cysts to become infected Up to half of thyroglossal cysts are not diagnosed until adult life The tract can lie dormant for years or even decades until some kind of stimulus leads to cystic dilation Infection can sometimes cause the transient appearance of a mass or enlargement of the cyst at times with periodic recurrences Spontaneous drainage may also occur Differential diagnosis are ectopic thyroid enlarged lymph nodes dermoid cysts and goiter Thyroglossal cyst usually presents as a midline neck lump in the region of the hyoid bone that is usually painless smooth and cystic though if infected pain can occur There may be difficulty breathing dysphagia difficulty swallowing or dyspepsia discomfort in the upper abdomen especially if the cyst becomes large The most common location for a thyroglossal cyst is midline or slightly off midline between the isthmus of the thyroid and the hyoid bone or just above the hyoid bone A thyroglossal cyst can develop anywhere along a thyroglossal duct though cysts within the tongue or in the floor of the mouth are rare A thyroglossal cyst will move upwards with protrusion of the tongue Thyroglossal cysts are associated with an increased incidence of ectopic thyroid tissue Occasionally a lingual thyroid can be seen as a flattened strawberry like lump at the base of the tongue
Patients with aceruloplasminemia develop a variety of movement problems They may experience dystonia of the head and neck resulting in repetitive movements and contortions Other involuntary movements may also occur such as tremors chorea blepharospasms and grimacing Affected individuals may also experience ataxia the lack of coordination of muscle movements Some develop psychiatric problems and midlife dementia The type of neurological disruption corresponds to associated regions of iron deposition in the brain and liver In addition to neurological problems affected individuals may have diabetes mellitus caused by iron damage to cells in the pancreas that make insulin This impairs blood sugar regulation and leads to the signs and symptoms of diabetes Iron accumulation in the tissues and organs results in a corresponding iron deficiency in the blood leading to anemia Anemia and diabetes usually occur by the time an affected person is in his or her twenties Affected individuals also experience retinal degeneration caused by excess iron The changes result in small opaque spots and areas of atrophy around the edges of the retina These abnormalities usually do not affect vision but can be observed during an eye examination
Symptoms of DPB include chronic sinusitis inflamed paranasal sinuses wheezing crackles respiratory sounds made by obstructions such as phlegm and secretions in the lungs dyspnea shortness of breath and a severe cough that yields large amounts of sputum coughed up phlegm There may be pus in the sputum and affected individuals may have fever Typical signs of DPB progression include dilation enlargement of the bronchiolar passages and hypoxemia low levels of oxygen in the blood If DPB is left untreated bronchiectasis will occur it is characterized by dilation and thickening of the walls of the bronchioles inflammatory damage to respiratory and terminal bronchioles and pooling of mucus in the lungs DPB is associated with progressive respiratory failure hypercapnia increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood and can eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension high blood pressure in the pulmonary vein and artery and cor pulmonale dilation of the right ventricle of the heart or right heart failure

In clubfoot feet are rotated inward and downward The affected foot and leg may be smaller than the other while in about half of cases clubfoot affects both feet Most of the time clubfoot is not associated with other problems Clubfoot can be diagnosed by ultrasound of the fetus in more than 60 of cases The earliest week of gestation in which the condition is diagnosed with a high degree of confidence was the 12th and the latest was the 32nd Not all patients were diagnosed at an early stage In 29 of fetuses the first ultrasound examination failed to detect the deformity which subsequently became obvious at a later examination Clubfoot was diagnosed between 12 and 23 weeks of gestation in 86 of children and between 24 and 32 weeks of gestation in the remaining 14 Without treatment the foot remains deformed and people walk on the sides or tops of their feet which can cause calluses foot infections trouble fitting into shoes pain difficulty walking and disability
Closing of the ductus arteriosus in a heart that is severely underdeveloped on the left results in cyanosis and respiratory distress which can progress to cardiogenic shock and death Early symptoms might include poor feeding or cyanosis that does not respond to oxygen administration Peripheral pulses may be weak and extremities cool to the touch HLHS often co occurs with low birth weight and premature birth In neonates with a small atrial septal defect termed restrictive there is inadequate mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood These neonates quickly decompensate and develop acidosis and cyanosis On EKG right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy are common but not indicative of HLHS Chest x ray may show a large heart cardiomegaly or increased pulmonary vasculature Neonates with HLHS do not typically have a heart murmur but in some cases a pulmonary flow murmur or tricuspid regurgitation murmur may be audible Co occurring tricuspid regurgitation or right ventricular dysfunction can cause hepatomegaly to develop
People may be asymptomatic but common symptoms are abdominal discomfort anorectal pain mucous discharge and rectal bleeding that develops from the inflamed mucosa of the distal unused colon
Symptoms of orthorexia nervosa include obsessive focus on food choice planning purchase preparation and consumption food regarded primarily as source of health rather than pleasure distress or disgust when in proximity to prohibited foods exaggerated faith that inclusion or elimination of particular kinds of food can prevent or cure disease or affect daily well being periodic shifts in dietary beliefs while other processes persist unchanged moral judgment of others based on dietary choices body image distortion around sense of physical impurity rather than weight persistent belief that dietary practices are health promoting despite evidence of malnutrition
Symptoms include brittle hair mild mental retardation and nail dysplasia The syndrome was first observed in Sabinas a small community in northern Mexico The principal biochemical features of the illness are reduced hair cystine levels increased copper zinc ratio and presence of arginosuccinic acid in the blood and urine The key finding is brittle hair with low sulfur content but alternating dark and light bands under polarizing microscopy trichoschisis and absent or defective cuticle are additional important clues for the diagnosis of trichothiodystrophy Review of literature reveals extensive associated findings in trichothiodystrophy Amino acid analyses of control hair when compared with those of patients with the Sabinas syndrome showed very striking differences with regard to content of sulphur amino acids As in previous descriptions of amino acid abnormalities in the trichorrhexis nodosa of arginosuccinicaciduria there were increases in lysine aspartic acid alanine leucine isoleucine and tyrosine Trichothiodystrophy represents a central pathologic feature of a specific hair dysplasia associated with several disorders in organs derived from ectoderm and neuroectoderm Trichothiodystrophy or TTD is a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by abnormally sulfur deficient brittle hair and accompanied by ichthyosis and other manifestations Patients with trichothiodystrophy should have a thorough evaluation for other associated manifestations including investigation of photosensitivity and DNA repair defects Because the disease appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern detection of low sulfur brittle hair syndrome is also important for genetic counseling
People who develop ischemic hepatitis may have weakness fatigue mental confusion and low urine production oliguria A small percentage of affected people may develop hepatic coma Yellow discoloration of the skin jaundice can occur but is rare and temporary as is actual loss of function of the liver
Urticaria pigmentosa is characterized by excessive amounts of mast cells in the skin Red or brown spots are often seen on the skin typically around the chest forehead and back These mast cells when irritated e g by rubbing the skin heat exposure produce too much histamine triggering an allergic reaction that leads to hives localized to the area of irritation sometimes referred to as Dariers sign Severe itching usually follows and scratching the area only serves to further symptoms Symptoms can be mild flushing and hives that require no treatment moderate diarrhea tachycardia nausea vomiting headache and fainting or life threatening vascular collapse requiring emergency treatment and hospitalization
A painful and itchy reddish purple patch of skin that occurs in the same location with repeated exposures to the culprit drug is the classic presentation of a fixed drug reaction The lips genitals and hands are often involved

Diagnosis of GP becomes clear when skin lesions progress to tense blisters during the second or third trimester The face and mucous membranes are usually spared GP typically starts as a blistering rash in the navel area and then spreads over the entire body It is sometimes accompanied by raised hot painful welts called plaques After one to two weeks large tense blisters typically develop on the red plaques containing clear or blood stained fluid GP creates a histamine response that causes extreme relentless itching pruritus GP is characterized by flaring and remission during the gestational and sometimes post partum period Usually after delivery lesions will heal within months but may reoccur during menstruation
In terms of the signs symptoms of ulnar neuropathy trauma and pressure to the arm and wrist especially the elbow the medial side of the wrist and other sites close to the course of the ulnar nerve are of interest in this condition Many people complain of sensory changes in the fourth and fifth digits Rarely an individual actually notices that the unusual sensations are mainly in the medial side of the ring finger fourth digit Sometimes the third digit is also involved especially on the ulnar medial side The sensory changes can be a feeling of numbness or a tingling pain rarely occurs in the hand Complaints of pain tend to be more common in the arm up to and including the elbow area which is probably the most common site of pain in an ulnar neuropathy
The most common findings of cardiac asthma are the presence of wheeze cough or shortness of breath predominantly occurring at night or when laying down in a patient that possesses signs of congestive heart failure Additional findings consist of production of frothy or watery sputum and presence of water in the lungs that can be heard via stethoscope In severe cases a patient can experience multiple night time episodes of breathlessness changes in skin coloration and episodes of bloody sputum
It is experienced as an uncomfortable sensation in the tooth followed by an aching pain It may be shown on radiographs as a radiopaque or lighter mass at each root apex

Signs and symptoms of candidiasis vary depending on the area affected Most candidal infections result in minimal complications such as redness itching and discomfort though complications may be severe or even fatal if left untreated in certain populations In healthy immunocompetent persons candidiasis is usually a localized infection of the skin fingernails or toenails onychomycosis or mucosal membranes including the oral cavity and pharynx thrush esophagus and the genitalia vagina penis etc less commonly in healthy individuals the gastrointestinal tract urinary tract and respiratory tract are sites of candida infection In immunocompromised individuals Candida infections in the esophagus occur more frequently than in healthy individuals and have a higher potential of becoming systemic causing a much more serious condition a fungemia called candidemia Symptoms of esophageal candidiasis include difficulty swallowing painful swallowing abdominal pain nausea and vomiting
Cat scratch disease commonly presents as tender swollen lymph nodes near the site of the inoculating bite or scratch or on the neck and is usually limited to one side This condition is referred to as regional lymphadenopathy and occurs 1 3 weeks after inoculation Lymphadenopathy most commonly occurs in the axilla arms neck or jaw but may also occur near the groin or around the ear A vesicle or an erythematous papule may form at the site of initial infection Most people also develop systemic symptoms such as malaise decreased appetite and aches Other associated complaints include headache chills muscular pains joint pains arthritis backache and abdominal pain It may take 7 to 14 days or as long as two months for symptoms to appear Most cases are benign and self limiting but lymphadenopathy may persist for several months after other symptoms disappear The disease usually resolves spontaneously with or without treatment in one month In rare situations CSD can lead to the development of serious neurologic or cardiac sequelae such as meningoencephalitis encephalopathy seizures or endocarditis Endocarditis associated with Bartonella infection has a particularly high mortality Parinauds oculoglandular syndrome is the most common ocular manifestation of CSD and is a granulomatous conjunctivitis with concurrent swelling of the lymph node near the ear Optic neuritis or neuroretinitis is one of the atypical presentations People who are immunocompromised are susceptible to other conditions associated with B henselae and B quintana such as bacillary angiomatosis or bacillary peliosis Bacillary angiomatosis is primarily a vascular skin lesion that may extend to bone or be present in other areas of the body In the typical scenario the patient has HIV or another cause of severe immune dysfunction Bacillary peliosis is caused by B henselae that most often affects people with HIV and other conditions causing severe immune compromise The liver and spleen are primarily affected with findings of blood filled cystic spaces on pathology
The signs and symptoms of pericoronitis depend upon the severity and are variable
Corneal dystrophy may not significantly affect vision in the early stages However it does require proper evaluation and treatment for restoration of optimal vision Corneal dystrophies usually manifest themselves during the first or second decade but sometimes later It appears as grayish white lines circles or clouding of the cornea Corneal dystrophy can also have a crystalline appearance There are over 20 corneal dystrophies that affect all parts of the cornea These diseases share many traits They are usually inherited They affect the right and left eyes equally They are not caused by outside factors such as injury or diet Most progress gradually Most usually begin in one of the five corneal layers and may later spread to nearby layers Most do not affect other parts of the body nor are they related to diseases affecting other parts of the eye or body Most can occur in otherwise totally healthy people male or female Corneal dystrophies affect vision in widely differing ways Some cause severe visual impairment while a few cause no vision problems and are diagnosed during a specialized eye examination by an ophthalmologist Other dystrophies may cause repeated episodes of pain without leading to permanent loss of vision
Most patients experience moderate to severe hypercalcemia and high parathyroid hormone levels A large mass in the neck is often seen and kidney and bone abnormalities are common
The most common symptoms in impingement syndrome are pain weakness and a loss of movement at the affected shoulder The pain is often worsened by shoulder overhead movement and may occur at night especially when lying on the affected shoulder The onset of the pain may be acute if due to an injury or insidious if due to a gradual process such as an osteoarthritic spur The pain has been described as dull rather than sharp and lingers for long periods of time making it hard to fall asleep Other symptoms can include a grinding or popping sensation during movement of the shoulder The range of motion at the shoulder may be limited by pain A painful arc of movement may be present during forward elevation of the arm from 60 to 120 Passive movement at the shoulder will appear painful when a downward force is applied at the acromion but the pain will ease once the force is removed
The diagnosis of NAIT is usually made after an incidental finding of a low platelet count on a blood test or because of bleeding complications ranging from bruising or petechiae to intracranial hemorrhage in the fetus or newborn Frequently the reduction in platelet count is mild and the affected neonates remain largely asymptomatic NAIT is the commonest cause of a very low platelet count and the commonest cause of intracranial haemorrhage in the term neonate In case of severe thrombocytopenia the neonates may exhibit bleeding complications at or a few hours after delivery The most serious complication is intracranial hemorrhage leading to death in approximately 10 of symptomatic babies or neurologic sequelae in 20 of cases 80 of intracranial hemorrhages occur before birth After birth the greatest risk of bleeding is in the first four days of life
The major symptoms of OFC are bone pain or tenderness bone fractures and skeletal deformities such as bowing of the bones The underlying hyperparathyroidism may cause kidney stones nausea constipation fatigue and weakness X rays may indicate thin bones fractures bowing and cysts Fractures are most commonly localized in the arms legs or spine The addition of weight loss appetite loss vomiting polyuria and polydipsia to the aforementioned symptoms may indicate that OFC is the result of parathyroid carcinoma Parathyroid carcinoma an uncommon cancer of the parathyroid glands is generally indicated by serum calcium levels higher than usual even in comparison to the high serum calcium levels that OFC generally presents with Symptoms are also often more severe Generally the presence of a palpable neck mass is also indicative of the cancer occurring in approximately 50 of patients but virtually nonexistent in individuals with OFC with a different origin
Infants and young children with Kindler syndrome have a tendency to blister with minor trauma and are prone to sunburns As individuals with Kindler syndrome age they tend to have fewer problems with blistering and photosensitivity However pigment changes and thinning of the skin become more prominent Kindler syndrome can affect various mucous tissues such as the mouth and eyes which can lead to other health problems
The person may have an insidious course with increased respiratory rate foul smelling sputum hemoptysis and fever Complications may occur such as exudative pleural effusion empyema and lung abscesses If left untreated aspiration pneumonia can progress to form a lung abscess Another possible complication is an empyema in which pus collects inside the lungs If continual aspiration occurs the chronic inflammation can cause compensatory thickening of the insides of the lungs resulting in bronchiectasis
The visibility of this malformation varies from person to person from a barely noticeable line in the middle of the nose to the complete clefting of the nose which results in two half noses the airway is usually adequate Individuals with this birth anomaly dont have any symptoms related to their bifid nose
IVCS presents with a wide variety of signs and symptoms making it difficult to diagnose clinically Edema of the lower extremities peripheral edema caused by an increase in the venous blood pressure Tachycardia This is caused by the decreased preload decreased cardiac output and leads to increased frequency In pregnant women signs of fetal hypoxia and distress may be seen in the cardiotocography This is caused by decreased perfusion of the uterus resulting in hypoxemia of the fetus Supine hypotensive syndrome
The presentation is dependent upon the underlying cause The course can be rapid or chronic
Males In males the symptoms of Danon Disease are more severe Features of Danon Disease in males are An early age of onset of muscle weakness and heart disease onset in childhood or adolescence Some learning problems or intellectual disability can be present Muscle weakness can be severe and can affect endurance and the ability to walk Heart disease cardiomyopathy can be severe and can lead to a need for medications It usually progress to heart failure commonly complicated by atrial fibrillation and embolic strokes with severe neurological disability leading to death unless heart transplant is performed Cardiac conduction abnormalities can occur Wolff Parkinson White syndrome is a common conduction pattern in Danon disease Symptoms are usually gradually progressive Some individuals may have visual disturbances and or retinal pigment abnormalities Danon Disease is rare and unfamiliar to most physicians It can be mistaken for other forms of heart disease and or muscular dystrophies including Pompe disease Females In females the symptoms of Danon Disease are less severe Common symptoms of Danon Disease in females are A later age of onset of symptoms Many females will not have obvious symptoms until late adolescence or even adulthood Learning problems and intellectual disability are usually absent Muscle weakness is often absent or subtle Some females will tire easily with exercise Cardiomyopathy is often absent in childhood Some women will develop this in adulthood Cardiomyopathy can be associated with atrial fibrillation and embolic strokes Cardiac conduction abnormalities can occur Wolff Parkinson White syndrome is a common conduction pattern in Danon disease Symptoms in females progress more slowly than in males Some females may have visual disturbances and or retinal pigment abnormalities Danon Disease is rare and unfamiliar to most physicians The milder and more subtle symptoms in females can make it more difficult to diagnose females with Danon Disease
Symptoms can occur at any age typically in adolescence and early adulthood and rarely seen in children and severity depend on the location of the tumors Symptoms include but are not limited to Tinnitus Loss problems of balance Glaucoma Seizures Hearing loss Vision impairment Numbness or weakness in arms and legs
Dislike of ones appearance is common but individuals with BDD have extreme misperceptions about their physical appearance Whereas vanity involves a quest to aggrandize the appearance BDD is experienced as a quest to normalize the appearance merely Although delusional in about one of three cases the appearance concern is usually non delusional an overvalued idea The bodily area of focus can be nearly any and is commonly face hair and skin In addition multiple areas can be focused on simultaneously A subtype of body dysmorphic disorder is bigorexia anorexia reverse or muscle dysphoria In muscular dysphoria patients perceive their body as excessively thin despite being muscular and trained Many seek dermatological treatment or cosmetic surgery which typically does not resolve the distress On the other hand attempts at self treatment as by skin picking can create lesions where none previously existed BDD is an obsessive compulsive disorder but involves more depression and social avoidance despite DOC BDD often associates with social anxiety disorder Some experience delusions that others are covertly pointing out their flaws Cognitive testing and neuroimaging suggest both a bias toward detailed visual analysis and a tendency toward emotional hyper arousal Most generally one experiencing BDD ruminates over the perceived bodily defect several hours daily or longer uses either social avoidance or camouflaging with cosmetics or apparel repetitively checks the appearance compares it to that of other people and might often seek verbal reassurances One might sometimes avoid mirrors repetitively change outfits groom excessively or restrict eating BDDs severity can wax and wane and flareups tend to yield absences from school work or socializing sometimes leading to protracted social isolation with some becoming housebound for extended periods Social impairment is usually greatest sometimes approaching avoidance of all social activities Poor concentration and motivation impair academic and occupational performance The distress of BDD tends to exceed that of either major depressive disorder or diabetes and rates of suicidal ideation and attempts are especially high
Typically guttate psoriasis erupts after a throat infection or strep throat Initially when the throat infection has cleared up the person can feel fine for several weeks before noticing the appearance of red spots They appear small at first like a dry red spot which is slightly itchy When scratched or picked the top layer of dry skin is removed leaving dry red skin beneath with white dry areas marking where flakes of dry skin stop and start In the weeks that follow the spots can grow to as much as an inch in diameter Some of the larger ones may form a pale area in the center which is slightly yellow Guttate psoriasis can occur on any part of the body particularly the legs arms torso eyelids back bottom bikini line and neck The number of lesions can range from 5 to over 100 Generally the parts of the body most affected are seen on the arms legs back and torso
Symptoms begin in infancy and include hypotonia areflexia amyotrophy variable degrees of dysgenesis of the corpus callosum mild to severe intellectual and developmental delay psychiatric problems including paranoid delusions depression hallucinations and autistic like behavior
Parathyroid Hyperparathyroidism is present in 90 of patients Asymptomatic hypercalcemia is the most common manifestation about 25 of patients have evidence of nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis In contrast to sporadic cases of hyperparathyroidism diffuse hyperplasia or multiple adenomas are more common than solitary adenomas
Causes This might have occurred due to barotrauma of descent and or the effects of nasal decongestants It is due to unequal increase in middle ear pressures on ascent is usually mild and most often cleared by further ascent When the pressures in both ears reach ambient levels the stimulus for the dizziness stops Although most often mild the vertigo can persist until the diver reaches the surface continuing the unequal pressures which can damage the inner ear or ear drum Alternobaric vertigo is most pronounced when the diver is in the vertical position the spinning is towards the ear with the higher pressure and tends to develop when the pressures differ by 60 cm of water or more Ear clearing may be a remedy A similar vertigo can also occur as a result of unequal heating stimulation of one inner ear labyrinth over the other due to diving in a prone position in cold water the undermost ear being stimulated
Symptoms are pain and tenderness at the radial side of the wrist fullness or thickening over the thumb side of the wrist and difficulty gripping with the affected side of the hand The onset is often gradual Pain is made worse by movement of the thumb and wrist and may radiate to the thumb or the forearm
MSA is characterized by the following which can be present in any combination autonomic dysfunction parkinsonism muscle rigidity tremor and slow movement cerebellar ataxia Poor coordination unsteady walking double vision A variant with combined features of MSA and dementia with Lewy bodies may also exist There have also been occasional instances of frontotemporal lobar degeneration associated with MSA
Cloacas appear in a wide spectrum of variation in females born with the malformation The single orifice called a common channel may occur varying in length from 1 to 10 cm The length of the common channel can be used to judge prognostic outcomes and technical challenges during surgical repair A common channel less than 3 cm in length usually has good sphincter muscles and a well developed sacrum
Also known as a broken kneecap a patella fracture usually follows a history of trauma and commonly presents with swelling pain bruising and inability to both bend and straighten the knee The pain is worse when trying to stand and the person may be unable to walk The pain can also be aggravated by prolonged periods of sitting A painful defect may be felt in the knee and there may be blood in the joint
The most typical skin changes are a red patch erythematous macula with a central vesicle or pustule that heals without scarring This maculopapular rash can recur every 4 6 weeks and predominantly affect the upper chest and arms Erythema nodosum like skin lesions can affect the legs When a skin biopsy is examined under the microscope there can be signs of a neutrophilic dermatosis The joint pains in BADAS are typically episodic migratory and affecting multiple joints They can affect the small joints e g interphalangeal joints of the fingers and there can be associated tenosynovitis but there is no erosion or deformation in the long term Diarrhea may also occur
The symptoms may vary depending on the thyroid function i e hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism Hyperthyroidism can cause sweating rapid heart rate anxiety tremors fatigue difficulty sleeping sudden weight loss and protruding eyes Hypothyroidism can cause weight gain fatigue dry skin hair loss intolerance to cold and constipation The effects of this disease may be permanent but can sometimes be transient Symptoms may come and go depending on whether the person receives treatment and whether the treatment takes effect
Cryofibrinogenemic disease commonly begins in adults aged 40 50 years old with symptoms of the diseases occurring in the almost always affected organ skin Cutaneous symptoms include one or more of the following cold contact induced urticarial which may be the first sign of the disease painful episodes of finger and or toe arterial spasms termed Raynaud phenomena cyanosis a palpable purpura termed cryofibrinogenemic purpura and a lace like purplish discoloration termed livedo reticularis all of which occur primarily in the lower extremities but some of which may occur in the nose ears and buttocks non healing painful ulcerations and gangrene of the areas impacted by the cited symptoms Patients also have a history of cold sensitivity 25 of cases arthralgia 14 58 neuritis 7 19 myalgia 0 14 and overt thrombosis of arteries and veins 25 40 which may on rare occasions involve major arteries such of those of the brain and kidney Signs of renal involvement proteinuria hematuria decreased glomerular filtration rate and or rarely renal failure occur in 4 to 25 of cases Compared to secondary cryofibrinogemia primary crygofibrinogenemia has a higher incidence of cutaneous lesions arthralgia and cold sensitivity while having a far lower incidence of renal involvement Patients with secondary cryofibrinogenemia also exhibit signs and symptoms specific to the infectious malignant premalignant vasculitis and autoimmune disorders associated with their disease While rare individuals with cryofibrinogenemic disease may experience pathological bleeding due to the consumption of blood clotting factors consequential to the formation of cryofibrinogen precipitates
Since pancreatic cancer usually does not cause recognizable symptoms in its early stages the disease is typically not diagnosed until it has spread beyond the pancreas itself This is one of the main reasons for the generally poor survival rates Exceptions to this are the functioning PanNETs where over production of various active hormones can give rise to symptoms which depend on the type of hormone Bearing in mind that the disease is rarely diagnosed before the age of 40 common symptoms of pancreatic adenocarcinoma occurring before diagnosis include
Skin ulcers appear as open craters often round with layers of skin that have eroded The skin around the ulcer may be red swollen and tender Patients may feel pain on the skin around the ulcer and fluid may ooze from the ulcer In some cases ulcers can bleed and rarely patients experience fever Ulcers sometimes seem not to heal healing if it does occur tends to be slow Ulcers that heal within 12 weeks are usually classified as acute and longer lasting ones as chronic Ulcers develop in stages In stage 1 the skin is red with soft underlying tissue In the second stage the redness of the skin becomes more pronounced swelling appears and there may be some blisters and loss of outer skin layers During the next stage the skin may become necrotic down through the deep layers of skin and the fat beneath the skin may become exposed and visible In stage 4 deeper necrosis usually occurs the fat underneath the skin is completely exposed and the muscle may also become exposed In the last two stages the sore may cause a deeper loss of fat and necrosis of the muscle in severe cases it can extend down to bone level destruction of the bone may begin and there may be sepsis of joints Chronic ulcers may be painful Most patients complain of constant pain at night and during the day Chronic ulcer symptoms usually include increasing pain friable granulation tissue foul odour and wound breakdown instead of healing Symptoms tend to worsen once the wound has become infected Venous skin ulcers that may appear on the lower leg above the calf or on the lower ankle usually cause achy and swollen legs If these ulcers become infected they may develop an unpleasant odour increased tenderness and redness Before the ulcer establishes definitively there may be a dark red or purple skin over the affected area as well as a thickening drying and itchy skin Although skin ulcers do not seem of great concern at a first glance they are worrying conditions especially in people with diabetes as they are at risk of developing diabetic neuropathy Ulcers may also appear on the cheeks soft palate the tongue and on the inside of the lower lip These ulcers usually last from 7 to 14 days and can be painful
Chronic progressive pain and swelling of the affected joint are exacerbated by physical activity Joint effusion and limited range of motion are common associated features It affects primarily large joints including knee 50 of cases elbow hip and shoulder SOC is twice as common in men as women Some patients have intra articular bodies resting in stable positions within joint recesses or bursae These patients may be asymptomatic with SOC merely as an incidental finding at imaging
The presentation usually occurs in childhood or adolescence though there is no upper age limit for presentation and late onset is possible The main symptom is loss of visual acuity uncorrectable with glasses This manifests as the lack of the ability to see fine details when reading or viewing distant objects Symptoms typically develop before age 20 median age of onset 17 years old and include wavy vision blind spots blurriness loss of depth perception sensitivity to glare impaired colour vision and difficulty adapting to dim lighting delayed dark adaptation There is a wide variation between individuals in the symptoms experienced as well as the rate of deterioration in vision Vision loss can be attributed to buildup of byproducts of vitamin A in photoreceptor cells and Peripheral vision is usually less affected than fine central foveal vision
Clinical diagnostic features are lifelong eruptions of pityriasis versicolor like macules flat wart like papules one to many cutaneous horn like lesions and development of cutaneous carcinomas Patients present with flat slightly scaly red brown macules on the face neck and body recurring especially around the penial area or verruca like papillomatous lesions seborrheic keratosis like lesions and pinkish red plane papules on the hands upper and lower extremities and face The initial form of EV presents with only flat wart like lesions over the body whereas the malignant form shows a higher rate of polymorphic skin lesions and development of multiple cutaneous tumors Generally cutaneous lesions are spread over the body but some cases have only a few lesions which are limited to one extremity
All of the different types affect different regions of the extremities and can show up as early as 5 years of age to as late as 50 years old Distal myopathy has slow progress therefore the patient may not know that they have it until they are in their late 40s or 50s Miyoshi myopathy affects the posterior muscles of the lower leg more so than the anterior muscles of the lower leg
Symptoms are related to the organs in which sphingomyelin accumulates Enlargement of the liver and spleen hepatosplenomegaly may cause reduced appetite abdominal distension and pain Enlargement of the spleen splenomegaly may also cause low levels of platelets in the blood thrombocytopenia Accumulation of sphingomyelin in the central nervous system including the cerebellum results in unsteady gait ataxia slurring of speech dysarthria and difficulty swallowing dysphagia Basal ganglia dysfunction causes abnormal posturing of the limbs trunk and face dystonia Upper brainstem disease results in impaired voluntary rapid eye movements supranuclear gaze palsy More widespread disease involving the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures causes gradual loss of intellectual abilities causing dementia and seizures Bones also may be affected with the disease causing enlarged bone marrow cavities thinned cortical bone or a distortion of the hip bone called coxa vara Sleep related disorders also occur with the condition such as sleep inversion sleepiness during the day and wakefulness at night Gelastic cataplexy the sudden loss of muscle tone when the affected patient laughs is also seen
Pathophysiology Riedels thyroiditis is characterized by a replacement of the normal thyroid parenchyma by a dense fibrosis that invades adjacent structures of the neck and extends beyond the thyroid capsule This makes the thyroid gland stone hard woody and fixed to adjacent structures The inflammatory process infiltrates muscles and causes symptoms of tracheal compression Surgical treatment is required to relieve tracheal or esophageal obstruction
Patients with Morquio syndrome appear healthy at birth Types A and B have similar presentations but Type B generally has milder symptoms The age of onset is usually between 1 and 3 years of age Morquio syndrome causes progressive changes to the skeleton of the ribs and chest which may lead to neurological complications such as nerve compression Patients may also have hearing loss and clouded corneas Intelligence is usually normal unless a patient has untreated hydrocephalus Physical growth slows and often stops around age 8 Skeletal abnormalities include a bell shaped chest a flattening or curvature of the spine shortened long bones and dysplasia of the hips knees ankles and wrists The bones that stabilize the connection between the head and neck can be malformed odontoid hypoplasia in these cases a surgical procedure called spinal cervical bone fusion can be lifesaving Restricted breathing joint stiffness and heart disease are also common Children with the more severe form of MPS IV may not live beyond their twenties or thirties
In order to diagnose Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis ataxia and ophthalmoplegia must be present These are also diagnostic features of Miller Fisher syndrome and so Bickerstaffs is only diagnosed if other features are present which exclude Miller Fisher syndrome These may include drowsiness coma or hyperreflexia When the condition is defined in this way a number of other features are commonly but not always found among these are weakness of the limbs the face and or the bulbar muscles abnormalities of the pupils and absent reflexes Like some other autoimmune diseases the condition usually follows a minor infection such as a respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis
The most common symptoms are diarrhea abdominal pain weight loss and joint pains The joint pains may be due to migratory nondeforming arthritis which may occur many years before any digestive tract symptoms develop they tend to involve the large joints but can occur in any pattern and tend not to damage the joint surface to the point that the joint becomes deformed Fever and chills occur in a small proportion of people In its more advanced form malabsorption insufficient absorption of nutrients from the diet leads to wasting and the enlargement of lymph nodes in the abdomen Neurological symptoms discussed below are more common in those with the severe form of the abdominal disease Chronic malabsorptive diarrhea leads to the poor absorption of fat causing steatorrhea fatty offensive smelling stool flatulence and abdominal distension Protein losing enteropathy may also occur causing depletion of albumin a blood protein which may lead to peripheral edema caused by the lowered oncotic pressures Hyperpigmentation of the skin occurs in almost half some also have skin nodules Various eye problems such as uveitis may occur this is typically associated with deteriorating vision and pain in the affected eye Endocarditis infection of the heart valve has been reported in a small number of cases sometimes in people with no other symptoms of Whipples disease this is typically noticed as breathlessness and leg swelling due to fluid accumulation as the heart is unable to pump fluid through the body Of those affected by Whipples disease 10 40 have problems related to the involvement of the brain the symptoms relate to the part of the brain that is affected The most common problems are dementia memory loss confusion and decreased level of consciousness Eye movement disturbances and myorhythmia rapidly repetitive movements of the muscles of the face together referred to as oculomasticatory myorhythmia are highly characteristic for Whipples disease Weakness and poor coordination of part of the body headaches seizures and a number of more uncommon neurological features are present in some cases
Panniculitis can also be classified based on the presence or absence of systemic symptoms Panniculitis without systemic disease can be a result of trauma or cold Panniculitis with systemic disease can be caused by
In many cases a bicuspid aortic valve will cause no problems People with BAV may become tired more easily than those with normal valvular function and have difficulty maintaining stamina for cardio intensive activities due to poor heart performance caused by stress on the aortic wall
OPD is associated with a large variety of symptoms such as deficits in cognitive function dysfunctional abnormal behaviour psychosis neurosis higher irritability and altered emotional expression Those with OPD can experience emotional lability meaning that their emotional expressions are unstable and fluctuating In addition patients may show a reduction in ability of perseverance with goals and they disinhibition often characterised by inappropriate sexual and antisocial behavior Those affected can experience cognitive disturbances suspiciousness and paranoia Altered language processing in the brain can also occur Furthermore patients may show changes in their sexual preference and hyposexuality symptoms
Clinically the teeth look normal in colour and morphologic appearance however they are commonly very mobile and exfoliated prematurely Both primary and permanent dentitions can be affected by either type I or type II dentin dysplasia However deciduous teeth affected by type II dentin dysplasia have a characteristic blue amber discolouration whilst the other dentition appears normal
sIBM causes progressive muscle weakness How sIBM affects individuals is variable including the age of onset which generally varies from the forties upwards and rate of progression Because of this variability there is no textbook case Common early symptoms include frequent tripping and falling and difficulty going up stairs Foot drop in one or both feet can occur Part of the cause for this dysfunction is the early involvement of the quadriceps muscles Weakness of the tibialis anterior muscle is responsible for foot drop Another common early symptom is trouble manipulating the fingers such as difficulty with tasks such as turning doorknobs or gripping keys Weakness of finger flexion and ankle dorsiflexion occurs early sIBM also preferentially affects the wrist flexors biceps and triceps During the course of the illness the patients mobility is progressively restricted as it becomes difficult to bend down reach for things and walk quickly Many patients say they have balance problems and fall easily as the muscles cannot compensate for an off balanced posture Because sIBM makes the leg muscles weak and unstable patients are very vulnerable to serious injury from tripping or falling down Although pain has not been traditionally part of the textbook description many patients report severe muscle pain especially in the thighs
Oliguria or anuria decreased or absent urine output Fatigue Asterixis flapping tremor Decreased alertness Confusion Pale skin Tachycardia rapid pulse Xerostomia dry mouth Thirst Edema anasarca swelling Orthostatic blood pressure fluctuates depending on body position Uremic frost a condition that occurs when urea and urea derivatives are secreted through the skin in sweat which evaporates away to leave solid uric compounds resembling a frost A urinalysis will typically show a decreased urine sodium level a high urine creatinine to serum creatinine ratio a high urine urea to serum urea ratio and concentrated urine determined by osmolality and specific gravity None of these is particularly useful in diagnosis In pre renal and post renal azotemias elevation of urea exceeds that of the creatinine i e BUN 12 creatinine This is because urea is readily reabsorbed by the kidneys while creatinine is not In congestive heart failure a cause of pre renal azotemia or any other condition that causes poor perfusion of kidneys the sluggish flow of glomerular filtrate results in excessive absorption of urea and elevation of its value in blood Creatinine however is not absorbable and therefore does not rise significantly Stasis of urine in post renal azotemia has the same effect
Common symptoms include muscle weakness cramps stiffness and tetany
The disease often presents in infancy with colicky pain failure to thrive and other symptoms and signs of the chylomicronemia syndrome In women the use of estrogens or first pregnancy are also well known trigger factors for initial manifestation of LPLD At all ages the most common clinical manifestation is recurrent abdominal pain and acute pancreatitis The pain may be epigastric with radiation to the back or it may be diffuse with the appearance of an emergent acute abdomen Other typical symptoms are eruptive xanthomas in about 50 of patients lipaemia retinalis and hepatosplenomegaly
People who are on mechanical ventilation are often sedated and are rarely able to communicate As such many of the typical symptoms of pneumonia will either be absent or unable to be obtained The most important signs are fever or low body temperature new purulent sputum and hypoxemia decreasing amounts of oxygen in the blood However these symptoms may be similar for tracheobronchitis
Signs and symptoms of fat necrosis are presented below
A history of a broken bone is usually apparent The patient complains of persistent pain at the fracture site and may also notice abnormal movement or clicking at the level of the fracture An x ray plate of the fractured bone shows a persistent radiolucent line at the fracture Callus formation may be evident but callus does not bridge across the fracture If there is doubt about the interpretation of the x ray stress x rays tomograms or CT scan may be used for confirmation
Signs and symptoms of mild cinchonism which may occur from standard therapeutic doses of quinine include flushed and sweaty skin ringing of the ears tinnitus blurred vision impaired hearing confusion reversible high frequency hearing loss headache abdominal pain rashes drug induced lichenoid reaction lichenoid photosensitivity vertigo dizziness nausea vomiting and diarrhea Large doses of quinine may lead to severe but reversible symptoms of cinchonism skin rashes deafness somnolence diminished visual acuity or blindness anaphylactic shock and disturbances in heart rhythm or conduction and death from cardiotoxicity damage to the heart Quinine may also trigger a rare form of hypersensitivity reaction in malaria patients termed blackwater fever that results in massive hemolysis hemoglobinemia hemoglobinuria and kidney failure Most symptoms of cinchonism except in severe cases are reversible and disappear once quinine is withdrawn Attempted suicide by intake of a large dose of quinine has caused irreversible tunnel vision and very severe visual impairment Patients treated with quinine may also suffer from low blood sugar especially if it is administered intravenously and hypotension low blood pressure Quinine like chloroquine inactivates enzymes in the lysosomes of cells and has an anti inflammatory effect hence its use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis However inactivation of these enzymes can also cause abnormal accumulation of glycogen and phospholipids in lysosomes causing toxic myopathy It is possible this action is the root cause of cinchonism
Microscopic colitis causes chronic watery diarrhea with greater than 10 bowel movements per day Some patients report nocturnal diarrhea abdominal pain urgency fecal incontinence fatigue dehydration and weight loss Patients report a significantly diminished quality of life
Opiate overdose symptoms and signs can be referred to as the opioid overdose triad decreased level of consciousness pinpoint pupils and respiratory depression Other symptoms include seizures and muscle spasms Sometimes an opiate overdose can lead to such a decreased level of consciousness such that the person will not wake up Because of their effect on the part of the brain that regulates breathing opioids can cause very slow or stopped breathing during overdoses leading to hypoxia or death if left untreated Hypoxia is typically caused by respiratory depression The brain uses oxygen to regulate the homeostasis of the body In animal studies it was found that opioids act on specific regions of the central nervous system associated with respiratory regulation including the medulla and pons During cerebral hypoxia there is a lack of sufficient oxygen supply to the brain Prolonged lack of oxygenation from respiratory depression can lead to detrimental damage to the brain and spinal cord and can leave the person unable to walk or function normally even if treatment with naloxone is given Alcohol also causes respiratory depression and therefore when taken with opioids can increase the risk of respiratory depression and death In young children opioid overdose may not be apparent right away This is due to absorption distribution and metabolism differences between young children and adults and the higher amount of opioid ingestion per kilogram of body weight
Individuals with CPH suffer multiple short severe headaches a day often more than five with most lasting between 5 and 30 minutes each When compared to cluster headaches CPH attacks are typically shorter Each headache is centered around the eye temple and forehead and is localized to one side of the head While redness and watering of the eye are associated with CPH patients typically do not experience nausea or vomiting Although less common CPH may also present as severe unilateral ear pain accompanied by autonomic symptoms Autonomic symptoms may include the presence of Red Ear Syndrome Attacks hit the patient many times a day from 5 times a day up to 40 times a day with an average of 11 a day Mild background pain can persist between attacks They come in bouts that last from 7 days to 1 year separated by remission periods that can last more than 3 months in episodic patients or less than 3 months in chronic patients Onset is in adulthood and the disorder may last indefinitely or spontaneously go into remission Circadian mechanisms are likely involved in paroxysmal hemicrania due to its highly cyclic nature No particular circannual recurrence characterizes symptomatic periods although some patients can experience a seasonal preponderance
A number of abnormalities and symptoms have been observed with hypertryptophanemia Musculoskeletal effects include joint contractures of the elbows and interphalangeal joints of the fingers and thumbs specifically the distal phalanges pes planus fallen arches an ulnar drift affecting the fingers of both hands an unusual yet correctible feature where the fingers slant toward the ulnar side of the forearm joint pain and laxity and adduction of the thumbs where the thumb appears drawn into the palm related to contracture of the adductor pollicis Behavioral developmental and other anomalies often include hypersexuality perceptual hypersensitivity emotional lability mood swings hyperaggressive behavior hypertelorism widely set eyes optical strabismus misalignment and myopia Metabolically hypertryptophanemia results in tryptophanuria and exhibits significantly elevated serum levels of tryptophan exceeding 650 of maximum normal range 25 73 micromole l in some instances A product of the bacterial biosynthesis of tryptophan is indole The excess of tryptophan in hypertryptophanemia also results in substantial excretion of indoleic acids These findings suggest a possible congenital defect in the metabolic pathway where tryptophan is converted to kynurenine
Symptoms develop over days or weeks The subacute development of short term memory deficits is considered the hallmark of this disease but this symptom is often overlooked because it is overshadowed by other more obvious symptoms such as headache irritability sleep disturbance delusions hallucinations agitation seizures and psychosis or because the other symptoms mean the patient has to be sedated and it is not possible to test memory in a sedated patient
Signs and symptoms of Palatal Myoclonus include A rhythmic clicking sound in the ear due to the opening and closing of the Eustachian tube Rhythmic jerky movements in the face eyeballs tongue jaw vocal cord or extremities mostly hands
Symptoms include severe back pain leading to lack of mobility Some very young children may refuse to walk and arching of the back is possible In post operative situations the symptoms occur within a week and result in severe low back pain or neck pain depending on the surgical location If untreated the discitis may resolve on its own causing spontaneous fusion of the intervertebral disc space cause a chronic low grade infection or progress to osteomyelitis and possibly even an epidural abscess In case of concomitant inflammation of one or more vertebrae in such cases usually involving the areas adjacent to the intervertebral disc spaces the condition is called spondylodiscitis
Some early signs of HIBMs includes
Children with autosomal dominant MED experience joint pain and fatigue after exercising Their x rays show small and irregular ossifications centers most apparent in the hips and knees There are very small capital femoral epiphyses and hypoplastic poorly formed acetabular roofs A waddling gait may develop Knees have metaphyseal widening and irregularity while hands have brachydactyly short fingers and proximal metacarpal rounding Flat feet are very common The spine is normal but may have a few irregularities such as scoliosis By adulthood people with MED are of short stature or in the low range of normal and have short limbs relative to their trunks Frequently movement becomes limited at the major joints especially at the elbows and hips However loose knee and finger joints can occur Signs of osteoarthritis usually begin in early adulthood Children with recessive MED experience joint pain particularly of the hips and knees and commonly have deformities of the hands feet knees or vertebral column like scoliosis Approximately 50 of affected children have abnormal findings at birth such as club foot or twisted metatarsals cleft palate inward curving fingers due to underdeveloped bones and brachydactyly or ear swelling caused by injury during birth Height is in the normal range before puberty As adults people with recessive MED are only slightly more diminished in stature but within the normal range Lateral knee radiography can show multi layered patellae
A normal nasal septum is rigid and thin If you have a septal hematoma your doctor will be able to press it down with a swab as the area will be soft A quick check in the nose will show any swelling between the nostrils Symptoms can include
It is often characterized by a decrease in flow and duration of bleeding absence of menstrual bleeding little menstrual bleeding or infrequent menstrual bleeding and infertility Menstrual anomalies are often but not always correlated with severity adhesions restricted to only the cervix or lower uterus may block menstruation Pain during menstruation and ovulation is sometimes experienced and can be attributed to blockages It has been reported that 88 of AS cases occur after a D C is performed on a recently pregnant uterus following a missed or incomplete miscarriage birth or during an elective termination abortion to remove retained products of conception
Kidneys Individuals with Okamoto syndrome are usually born with hydronephrosis or dilation of the internal structures of the kidneys due to narrowing stenosis of the passage between the kidneys and the ureters the ureteropelvic junction leading to a build up of urine There is also often vesicoureteral reflux in which urine passes backwards from the bladder to the ureters and frequent urinary tract infections
This syndrome is characterized by overgrowth and advanced bone age Affected individuals have dysmorphic features with macrodolichocephaly downslanting palpebral fissures and a pointed chin The facial appearance is most notable in early childhood Affected infants and children tend to grow quickly they are significantly taller than their siblings and peers and have an unusually large skull and large head Adult height is usually in the normal range although Broc Brown has the condition and was named the worlds tallest teenager As of late 2016 he was 78 and still growing Individuals with Sotos syndrome often have intellectual impairment and most also display autistic traits Frequent behavioral impairments include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD phobias obsessive compulsive disorder tantrums and impulsive behaviors impulse control disorder Problems with speech and language are also common Affected individuals may often have stuttering difficulty with sound production or a monotone voice Additionally weak muscle tone hypotonia may delay other aspects of early development particularly motor skills such as sitting and crawling Other signs include scoliosis seizures heart or kidney defects hearing loss and problems with vision Some infants with this disorder experience jaundice and poor feeding A small number of patients with Sotos syndrome have developed cancer most often in childhood but no single form of cancer has been associated with this condition It remains uncertain whether Sotos syndrome increases the risk of specific types of cancer If persons with this disorder have any increased cancer risk their risk is only slightly greater than that of the general population
The characteristic symptom of Degos disease is the development of papules Initially individuals may have skin lesions or rashes but they will proceed to develop distinct bumps or papules Papules are circular in shape have a porcelain white center and red border As papules age the white centers will skin in and only the border will remain raised Typically papules range from 0 5 to 1 cm in width Papules appear on the trunk and upper extremities and are not found on the individuals palms soles scalp or face Symptoms vary depending on whether an individual has the benign variant or malignant variant of the disease Both the benign and malignant forms have development of the characteristic papules Individuals with the benign form will have the typical papules persisting anywhere from a few years to throughout their whole lives In the benign form no inner organs are affected If an individual develops the malignant form it means that not only are the papules present but inner organs are involved Most malignant cases involve problems of the gastrointestinal tract leading to small intestine lesions abdominal pain diarrhea and bowel perforation If the central nervous system is involved symptoms can include headaches dizziness seizures paralysis of cranial nerves weakness stroke damage to small areas of the brain due to artery blockage cerebral infarcts and cerebral hemorrhage Additional organs commonly impacted include the heart lungs and kidneys Symptoms that may develop from damage to these organs include double vision diplopia clouding of lenses of eyes swelling of the optic disc papilledema partial loss of vision shortness of breath chest pain epilepsy and thickening of pericardium Someone with the benign form may suddenly develop symptoms of the malignant form Symptoms can last anywhere from a few weeks to several years Onset of symptoms typically begins to manifest between the ages of 20 50 A few cases of this condition in newborns have also been described
The earliest symptoms of shingles which include headache fever and malaise are nonspecific and may result in an incorrect diagnosis These symptoms are commonly followed by sensations of burning pain itching hyperesthesia oversensitivity or paresthesia pins and needles tingling pricking or numbness Pain can be mild to severe in the affected dermatome with sensations that are often described as stinging tingling aching numbing or throbbing and can be interspersed with quick stabs of agonizing pain Shingles in children is often painless but people are more likely to get shingles as they age and the disease tends to be more severe In most cases after one to two days but sometimes as long as three weeks the initial phase is followed by the appearance of the characteristic skin rash The pain and rash most commonly occur on the torso but can appear on the face eyes or other parts of the body At first the rash appears similar to the first appearance of hives however unlike hives shingles causes skin changes limited to a dermatome normally resulting in a stripe or belt like pattern that is limited to one side of the body and does not cross the midline Zoster sine herpete zoster without herpes describes a person who has all of the symptoms of shingles except this characteristic rash Later the rash becomes vesicular forming small blisters filled with a serous exudate as the fever and general malaise continue The painful vesicles eventually become cloudy or darkened as they fill with blood and crust over within seven to ten days usually the crusts fall off and the skin heals but sometimes after severe blistering scarring and discolored skin remain
People with visible marks generally feel fine physically and can act normally but when it is mentioned they may become withdrawn and self conscious Some children may have low self esteem due to the condition CMTC is an uncommon sporadic congenital vascular malformation characterized by a generalized or localized reticulated cutaneous vascular network Cutaneous lesions described in patients with CMTC include nevus flammeus hemangioma nevus anemicus café au lait spots melanocytic nevus aplasia cutis and acral cyanosis It has a marbled bluish to deep purple appearance The dark skin lesions often show a palpable loss of dermal substance The reticulated mottling frequently appears more prominent in a cold environment physiologic cutis marmorata but tends not to disappear with warming Hence the erythema may be worsened by cooling physical activity or crying CMTC frequently involves the extremities with the lower extremities involved most commonly followed by the upper extremities and then the trunk and face The lower extremities often show atrophy and seldom show hypertrophy resulting in limb circumference discrepancy When located on the trunk the lesions of CMTC tend to show mosaic distribution in streaks with a sharp midline demarcation seen across the abdomen The lesions are primarily localized but can be segmental or generalized often unilateral in appearance Diffuse involvement of the skin is usually not observed Although its course is variable the majority of lesions in mild cases fade by adolescence Ulceration and secondary infection are complications in severe cases and can be fatal if present in the neonatal period
Onset can be sudden or gradual When the onset is sudden symptoms include an inability to urinate and lower abdominal pain When of gradual onset symptoms may include loss of bladder control mild lower abdominal pain and a weak urine stream Those with long term problems are at risk of urinary tract infections
Encephalopathy is a general term describing brain malfunctions and toxic asserts that the malfunction is caused by toxins on the brain The most prominent characteristic of toxic encephalopathy is an altered mental status Acute intoxication is a reversible symptom of exposure to many synthetic chemical neurotoxicants Acute intoxication symptoms include lightheadedness dizziness headache and nausea and regular cumulative exposure to these neurotoxicants over a number of years puts the individual at high risk for developing toxic encephalopathy Chronic exposure to low levels of neurotoxic chemicals can also cause reversible changes in mood and affect which resolve with cessation of exposure Acute and chronic toxic encephalopathy on the other hand are persistent changes in neurological function that typically occur with exposure to higher concentrations and longer durations respectively The symptoms of acute and chronic toxic encephalopathy do not resolve with cessation of exposure and can include memory loss dementia small personality changes increased irritability insidious onset of concentration difficulties headache lightheadedness ataxia involuntary movements parkinsonism fatigue seizures arm strength problems and depression A paper by Feldman and colleagues described neurobehavioral effects in a 57 year old house painter with regular exposure to large amounts of solvents Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI analyses have also demonstrated increased rates of dopamine synthesis in the putamen reduced anterior and total corpus callosum volume demyelination in the parietal white matter basal ganglia and thalamus as well as atypical activation of frontal areas of the brain due to neural compensation The regions of interest on SPECT brain imaging include a majority of all cortical regions and the globus pallidus in Carbon monoxide poisoning Based on medical literature on SPECT brain imaging signature patterns for toxic encephalopathy is a nonspecific patchy diffuse pattern on the cortex and sometimes is shown in subcortical regions if exposure was severe A thorough and standard diagnostic process is paramount with toxic encephalopathy including a careful occupational medication and medical history standardized imaging and neuropsychological testing
The following can indicate a delusion An individual expresses an idea or belief with unusual persistence or force even when evidence suggests the contrary That idea appears to have an undue influence on the persons life and the way of life is often altered to an inexplicable extent Despite their profound conviction there is often a quality of secretiveness or suspicion when the person is questioned about it The individual tends to be humorless and oversensitive especially about the belief There is a quality of centrality no matter how unlikely it is that these strange things are happening to the person he or she accepts them relatively unquestioningly An attempt to contradict the belief is likely to arouse an inappropriately strong emotional reaction often with irritability and hostility They will not accept any other opinions The belief is at the least unlikely and out of keeping with the individuals social cultural and religious background The person is emotionally over invested in the idea and it overwhelms other elements of his or her psyche The delusion if acted out often leads to behaviors which are abnormal and out of character although perhaps understandable in light of the delusional beliefs Other people who know the individual observe that the belief and behavior are uncharacteristic and alien Additional features of delusional disorder include the following It is a primary disorder It is a stable disorder characterized by the presence of delusions to which the patient clings with extraordinary tenacity The illness is chronic and frequently lifelong The delusions are logically constructed and internally consistent The delusions do not interfere with general logical reasoning although within the delusional system the logic is perverted and there is usually no general disturbance of behavior If disturbed behavior does occur it is directly related to the delusional beliefs The individual experiences a heightened sense of self reference Events which to others are nonsignificant are of enormous significance to him or her and the atmosphere surrounding the delusions is highly charged However this should not be confused with gaslighting where a person denies the truth and causes the one being gaslit to think that they are being delusional
PION is characterized by moderate to severe painless vision loss of abrupt onset One or both eyes may be affected and color vision is typically impaired
Athletes heart most often does not have any physical symptoms although an indicator would be a consistently low resting heart rate Athletes with AHS often do not realize they have the condition unless they undergo specific medical tests because athletes heart is a normal physiological adaptation of the body to the stresses of physical conditioning and aerobic exercise People diagnosed with athletes heart commonly display three signs that would usually indicate a heart condition when seen in a regular person bradycardia cardiomegaly and cardiac hypertrophy Bradycardia is a slower than normal heartbeat at around 40 60 beats per minute Cardiomegaly is the state of an enlarged heart and cardiac hypertrophy the thickening of the muscular wall of the heart specifically the left ventricle which pumps oxygenated blood to the aorta Especially during an intensive workout more blood and oxygen are required to the peripheral tissues of the arms and legs in highly trained athletes bodies A larger heart results in higher cardiac output which also allows it to beat more slowly as more blood is pumped out with each beat Another sign of athletes heart syndrome is an S3 gallop which can be heard through a stethoscope This sound can be heard as the diastolic pressure of the irregularly shaped heart creates a disordered blood flow However if an S4 gallop is heard the patient should be given immediate attention An S4 gallop is a stronger and louder sound created by the heart if diseased in any way and is typically a sign of a serious medical condition
Proteus syndrome causes an overgrowth of skin bones muscles fatty tissues and blood and lymphatic vessels Proteus syndrome is a progressive condition wherein children are usually born without any obvious deformities Tumors of skin and bone growths appear as they age typically in early childhood The musculoskeletal manifestations are cardinal for the diagnosis of Proteus syndrome The severity and locations of these various asymmetrical growths vary greatly but typically the skull one or more limbs and soles of the feet will be affected There is a risk of premature death in affected individuals due to deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism caused by the vessel malformations that are associated with this disorder Because of carrying excess weight and enlarged limbs arthritis and muscle pain may also be symptoms Further risks may occur due to the mass of extra tissue The disorder itself does not uniformly cause learning impairments the distribution of intelligence deficits among those with Proteus syndrome appears higher than that of the general population although this is difficult to determine with statistical significance In addition the presence of visible deformity may have a negative effect on the social experiences of the affected individual causing cognitive and social deficits Affected individuals are at increased risk for developing certain tumors including unilateral ovarian cystadenomas testicular tumors meningiomas and monomorphic adenomas of the parotid gland Hemimegalencephaly is often found to be associated
The typical rash commonly appears on buttocks This then resembles the colour of a baboons buttocks Other areas like upper inner thigh and armpits may be affected by the rash The rashes are red and well defined The presentation is typically symmetrical and not associated with systemic symptoms
Common symptoms Symptoms are related to defects in connective tissue
People who are affected by Liebenberg Syndrome suffer from three main symptoms Dysplasia improper formation of the bony components of the elbow Abnormal shape of carpal bones Brachydactyly a symptom where the fingers and toes are shorter than normal
Symptoms are usually limited to one side of the head and in most cases the individual affected will experience intense sharp pain and paralysis of muscles around the eye Symptoms may subside without medical intervention yet recur without a noticeable pattern In addition affected individuals may experience paralysis of various facial nerves and drooping of the upper eyelid ptosis Other signs include double vision fever chronic fatigue vertigo or arthralgia Occasionally the patient may present with a feeling of protrusion of one or both eyeballs exophthalmos
CGPD is characterized by the presence of small raised dome shaped flesh colored or yellow brown papules primarily distributed around the mouth eyes and nose Affected children may also have papules on the ears eyelids cheeks forehead and nose CGPD skin lesions rarely affect areas of the skin other than the face
Symptoms of renovascular hypertension include the following High blood pressure early age Kidney dysfunction Narrowing of arteries elsewhere in the body Pulmonary edema
Patients may experience poorly localised transient pain in the wrist i e where the sensory branch of the AIN is mapped in the brain The pain is sometimes referred into the cubital fossa and elbow pain has been reported as being a primary complaint The characteristic severe impairment of the pincer movement of the thumb and index finger is most striking
Aside from constitutional symptoms of cancer such as malaise fever weight loss and fatigue Pancoast tumor can include a complete Horners syndrome in severe cases miosis constriction of the pupils anhidrosis lack of sweating ptosis drooping of the eyelid and pseudoenophthalmos as a result of the ptosis In progressive cases the brachial plexus is also affected causing pain and weakness in the muscles of the arm and hand with a symptomatology typical of thoracic outlet syndrome The tumor can also compress the recurrent laryngeal nerve and from this a hoarse voice and bovine non explosive cough may occur In superior vena cava syndrome obstruction of the superior vena cava by a tumor mass effect causes facial swelling cyanosis and dilatation of the veins of the head and neck A Pancoast tumor is an apical tumor that is typically found in conjunction with a history of smoking tobacco The clinical signs and symptoms may be mistaken for neurovascular compromise at the level of the superior thoracic aperture The patients smoking history rapid onset of clinical signs and symptoms and pleuritic pain can suggest an apical tumor A Pancoast tumor can give rise to both Pancoast syndrome and Horners syndrome When the brachial plexus roots are involved it will produce Pancoast syndrome involvement of sympathetic fibers as they exit the cord at T1 and ascend to the superior cervical ganglion will produce Horners syndrome
The World Health Organisation WHO recognise DCD as a condition and have published their definition in the International Classification of Diseases This describes DCD as
The incubation period the time between when infection occurs and when symptoms appear varies from virus to virus but is usually limited between 2 and 15 days for arboviruses The majority of infections however are asymptomatic Among cases in which symptoms do appear symptoms tend to be non specific resembling a flu like illness and are not indicative of a specific causative agent These symptoms include fever headache malaise rash and fatigue Rarely vomiting and hemorrhagic fever may occur The central nervous system can also be affected by infection as encephalitis and meningitis are sometimes observed Prognosis is good for most people but is poor in those who develop severe symptoms with up to a 20 mortality rate in this population depending on the virus The very young elderly pregnant women and people with immune deficiencies are more likely to develop severe symptoms
Complications Because ischemic priapism causes the blood to remain in the penis for unusually long periods of time the blood becomes deprived of oxygen which can cause damage to the penile tissue Such damage can result in erectile dysfunction or disfigurement of the penis In extreme cases if the penis develops severe vascular disease the priapism can result in penile gangrene
CADASIL may start with attacks of migraine with aura or subcortical transient ischemic attacks or strokes or mood disorders between 35 and 55 years of age The disease progresses to subcortical dementia associated with pseudobulbar palsy and urinary incontinence Ischemic strokes are the most frequent presentation of CADASIL with approximately 85 of symptomatic individuals developing transient ischemic attacks or stroke s The mean age of onset of ischemic episodes is approximately 46 years range 30 70 A classic lacunar syndrome occurs in at least two thirds of affected patients while hemispheric strokes are much less common It is worthy of note that ischemic strokes typically occur in the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors Recurrent silent strokes with or without clinical strokes often lead to cognitive decline and overt subcortical dementia A case of CADASIL presenting as schizophreniform organic psychosis has been reported
Ring 18 causes a wide range of medical and developmental concerns As discussed above people with ring 18 can have features of both distal 18q and 18p The features of distal 18q and 18p vary greatly because of the variability of the deletion size and breakpoint locations between people Because ring 18 can involve unique deletions of both the p and q arms of the chromosome there is twice as much reason for the variability between individuals This variation is also partly attributable to the incidence of mosaicism which is relatively common in people with ring 18
A patient with cuboid syndrome usually seeks medical advice and attention complaining of pain discomfort or weakness along the lateral aspect of the foot between the fourth and fifth metatarsals and the calcaneocuboid joint The pain may radiate throughout the foot Tenderness may be elicited over the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle and an antalgic gait may be observed The pain may be observed in a controlled environment by standing on the toes or rolling the arches of the foot as these motions tend to exercise the foots calcaneocuboid joint and ligament which are characteristically strained in a patient suffering from cuboid syndrome Also the pain may come on suddenly or it may develop gradually and persist over time Sometimes the pain is intermittent subsiding partially or completely for a period of time before returning again
The coloration of the skin hair and eyes is different in children with PKU This is caused by low levels of tyrosine whose metabolic pathway is blocked by deficiency of PAH Another skin alteration that might occur is the presence of irritation or dermatitis The childs behaviour may be influenced as well due to augmented levels of phenethylamine which in turn affects levels of other amines in the brain Psychomotor function may be affected and observed to worsen progressively
Patients with Unverricht Lundborg disease exhibit myoclonic jerks and tonic clonic seizures at a young age between ages 6 16 The myoclonic jerks occur in the muscles of the arms and legs closest to the torso and are triggered due to a variety of common external stimuli Seizures begin at an average age of 10 8 years with myoclonus beginning around 12 1 years It is not currently possible to diagnose without a genetic test and since early symptoms are general it is often mistaken for another more common epilepsy in many cases juvenile myoclonic epilepsy JME
It is common for individuals with PDD NOS to have more intact social skills and a lower level of intellectual deficit than individuals with other PDDs Characteristics of many individuals with PDD NOS are
The patients can present with symptoms indicating spinal cord involvement such as paralysis of arms and legs numbness and loss of sensation and sphincter dysfunction and pathological examination reveals disseminated nerve cell death in the spinal cord
ALD can present in different ways The different presentations are complicated by the pattern of X linked recessive inheritance There have been seven phenotypes described in males with ABCD1 mutations and five in females Initial symptoms in boys affected with the childhood cerebral form of ALD include emotional instability hyperactivity and disruptive behavior at school Older patients affected with the cerebral form will present with similar symptoms Untreated cerebral ALD is characterized by progressive demyelination leading to a vegetative state and death Adult males with an adrenomyeloneuropathy presentation typically present initially with muscle stiffness paraparesis and sexual dysfunction All patients with clinically recognized ALD phenotypes are at risk for adrenal insufficiency There is no reliable way to predict which form of the disease an affected individual will develop with multiple phenotypes being demonstrated within families Onset of adrenal insufficiency is often the first symptom appearing as early as two years of age
Symptoms of JPLS begin in early childhood and progress over a period of 15 to 20 years Early symptoms include clumsiness muscle spasms weakness and stiffness in the legs and difficulty with balance As symptoms progress they become more serious and include weakness and stiffness in the arms and hands slurred speech drooling difficulty swallowing and an inability to walk
LCH provokes a non specific inflammatory response which includes fever lethargy and weight loss Organ involvement can also cause more specific symptoms
Warning symptoms Warning symptoms also called prodrome symptoms often happen before a migraine attack
It is important to continue to watch for symptoms and signs of active disease during and after treatment to ensure that the disease is responding adequately and has not re activated after therapy has been discontinued Response to therapy may be indicated by the resolution of scalp symptoms such as itching pain tenderness or burning by improvement in the signs of scalp inflammation such as decreased redness scaling or pustules and by halting or slowing the progression of hair loss A dermatologist can document and monitor a patients cicatricial alopecia using these guidelines and with the pull test Photographs of the scalp may be useful in monitoring the course of the disease and response to treatment
Most women with this condition present in the third trimester although it can present as early as seven weeks with itching without a rash Typically the itching is localized to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet but can be anywhere on the body Hallmarks of ICP include the following symptoms Most common
Post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis Post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis PKDL is a recurrence of kala azar that may appear on the skin of affected individuals months and up to 20 years after being partially treated untreated or even in those considered adequately treated In Sudan they can be demonstrated in up to 60 of treated cases They manifest as hypopigmented skin lesions such as macules papules nodules or facial redness Though any organism causing kala azar can lead to PKDL it is commonly associated with Leishmania donovani which gives different disease patterns in India and Sudan In the Indian variant nodules enlarge with time and form plaques but rarely ulcerate but nodules from the African variety often ulcerate as they progress Nerve involvement is common in African variety but rare in Indian subcontinent Histology demonstrates a mixture of chronic inflammatory cells there can be macrophage or epitheloid granuloma Parasite concentration is not consistent among studies perhaps reflecting low sensitivity of diagnostic methods used in earlier entries Current approach to diagnosis involves
In terms of the signs and symptoms of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy would be consistent with the following PtosisWeakness of the extraocular musclesDysphagiaAspiration pneumonia complication Proximal limb weaknessThough the aforementioned signs symptoms are the most common there have been cases though rare where the peripheral nervous system has had involvement with significant reduction of myelinated fibers In homozygous cases this muscular dystrophy is severe and starts earlier in the affected individuals life
Symptoms of lumbar anterolisthesis include
Nodules are discrete generally symmetric hyperpigmented or purpuric and firm They are greater than 0 5 cm in both width and depth as opposed to papules which are less than 0 5 cm They can appear on any part of the body but generally begin on the arms and legs Excoriated lesions are often flat umbilicated or have a crusted top Nodules may appear to begin in the hair follicles Nodule pattern may be follicular In true prurigo nodularis a nodule forms before itching begins Typically these nodules are extremely pruritic and are alleviated only by steroids
Signs of perichondritis or chondritis in patients with an embedded earring are similar these include pain swelling and erythema of the overlying skin and fluctuant swelling indicate an abscess that we should drain typically associated with chondritis Clinically perichondritis can be differentiated from cellulitis of the pinna in that the first usually does not involve the earlobe In serious cases pus appears between the perichondrium and cartilage Purulent melting of auricular cartilage takes place Dead tissue tears away as a result auricle deforms strongly and becomes shrunken
The classic characterization of the group of neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders called the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses NCLs is through the progressive permanent loss of motor and psychological ability with a severe intracellular accumulation of lipofuscins with the United States and Northern European populations having slightly higher frequency with an occurrence of one in 10 000 Four classic diagnoses have received the most attention from researchers and the medical field differentiated from one another by age of symptomatic onset duration early onset manifestations such as blindness or seizures and the forms which lipofuscin accumulation takes In the early infantile variant of NCL also called INCL or Santavuori Haltia probands appear normal at birth but early visual loss leading to complete retinal blindness by the age of 2 years is the first indicator of the disease by 3 years of age a vegetative state is reached and by 4 years isoelectric encephalograms confirm brain death Late infantile variant usually manifests between 2 and 4 years of age with seizures and deterioration of vision The maximum age before death for late infantile variant is 10 12 years Juvenile NCL JNCL Batten disease or Spielmeyer Vogt with a prevalence of one in 100 000 usually arises between 4 and 10 years of age the first symptoms include considerable vision loss due to retinal dystrophy with seizures psychological degeneration and eventual death in the mid to late 20s or 30s ensuing Adult variant NCL ANCL or Kufs disease is less understood and generally manifests milder symptoms however while symptoms typically appear around 30 years of age death usually occurs 10 years later All the mutations that have been associated with this disease have been linked to genes involved with the neural synapses metabolism most commonly with the reuse of vesicle proteins
Distress arising from an incongruence between a persons felt gender and assigned sex gender usually at birth is the cardinal symptom of gender dysphoria Gender dysphoria in those assigned male at birth AMAB tends to follow one of two broad trajectories early onset or late onset Early onset gender dysphoria is behaviorally visible in childhood Sometimes gender dysphoria will stop for a while in this group and they will identify as gay or homosexual for a period of time followed by recurrence of gender dysphoria This group is usually sexually attracted to members of their natal sex in adulthood commonly identifying as heterosexual Late onset gender dysphoria does not include visible signs in early childhood but some report having had wishes to be the opposite sex in childhood that they did not report to others Transgender people assigned male at birth who experience late onset gender dysphoria will usually be attracted to women and may identify as lesbians or bisexual while those with early onset will usually be attracted to men A similar pattern occurs in those assigned female at birth AFAB with those experiencing early onset GD being most likely to be attracted to women and those with late onset being most likely to be attracted to men and identify as gay Symptoms of GD in children include preferences for opposite sex typical toys games or activities great dislike of their own genitalia and a strong preference for playmates of the opposite sex Some children may also experience social isolation from their peers anxiety loneliness and depression In adolescents and adults symptoms include the desire to be and to be treated as a different gender Adults with GD are at increased risk for stress isolation anxiety depression poor self esteem and suicide Transgender people are also at heightened risk for eating disorders and substance abuse
About one third of children whose mothers are taking this drug during pregnancy typically have intrauterine growth restriction with a small head and develop minor dysmorphic craniofacial features microcephaly and intellectual disability and limb defects including hypoplastic nails and distal phalanges birth defects Heart defects including ventricular septal defect atrial septal defect patent ductus arteriosus and coarctation of the aorta may occur in these children A smaller population will have growth problems and developmental delay or intellectual disability Heart defects and cleft lip may also be featured
Thyroid storm is characterized by an acute onset of symptoms of hyperthyroidism fast heart rate restlessness agitation accompanied by other features such as fever temperatures often above 40 C 104 F hypertension mental status changes diarrhea and vomiting Individuals can exhibit varying signs of organ dysfunction Patients may experience liver dysfunction and jaundice yellowing of the skin which is considered a poor prognostic sign Cardiac heart symptoms include abnormal heart rhythms myocardial infarction heart attack and congestive heart failure which may lead to cardiovascular collapse Mortality can be as high as 20 30 In some situations individuals may not experience the classic signs of restlessness and agitation but instead present with apathetic signs of weakness and confusion
Among the signs and symptoms of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency are the following Aggressive behavior Microcephaly Autism Brachycephaly Mild Cerebellar hypoplasia Seizures
The first symptom of NIHL may be difficulty hearing a conversation against a noisy background The effect of hearing loss on speech perception has two components The first component is the loss of audibility which may be perceived as an overall decrease in volume Modern hearing aids compensate this loss with amplification The second component is known as distortion or clarity loss due to selective frequency loss Consonants due to their higher frequency are typically affected first For example the sounds s and t are often difficult to hear for those with hearing loss affecting clarity of speech NIHL can affect either one or both ears Unilateral hearing loss causes problems with directional hearing affecting the ability to localize sound
Cradle cap is seborrheic dermatitis that affects infants It presents on the scalp as greasy patches of scaling which appear thick crusty yellow white or brown The affected regions are not usually itchy and do not bother the child Other affected areas can include the eyelids ear around the nose and in the groin Hair loss can also occur
Dejerine Roussy syndrome is most commonly preceded by numbness in the affected side In these cases numbness is replaced by burning and tingling sensations widely varying in degree of severity across all cases The majority of those reported are cases in which the symptoms are severe and debilitating Burning and tingling can also be accompanied by hypersensitivity usually in the form of dysaesthesia or allodynia Less commonly some patients develop severe ongoing pain with little or no stimuli Allodynia is pain from a stimulus that would normally not cause pain For example there is a patient who experiences unrelenting pain when a breeze touches his skin Most patients experiencing allodynia experience pain with touch and pressure however some can be hypersensitive to temperature Dysaesthesia is defined as an unpleasant abnormal sense of touch It often presents as pain In this condition it is due to thalamic lesioning This form of neuropathic pain can be any combination of itching tingling burning or searing experienced spontaneously or from stimuli Allodynia and dysaesthesia replace numbness between one week and a few months after a thalamic stroke In general once the development of pain has stopped the type and severity of pain will be unchanging and if untreated persist throughout life Consequentially many will undergo some form of pain treatment and adjust to their new lives as best they can Pain associated with Dejerine Roussy syndrome is sometimes coupled with anosognosia or somatoparaphrenia which causes a patient having undergone a right parietal or right sided stroke to deny any paralysis of the left side when indeed there is or deny the paralyzed limb s belong to them Although debatable these symptoms are rare and considered part of a thalamic phenomenon and are not normally considered a characteristic of Dejerine Roussy syndrome
This can be remembered by the 4 S straight line dullness shifting dullness splash sound of coin
A carbuncle is a cluster of several boils which is typically filled with purulent exudate dead neutrophils phagocytized bacteria and other cellular components Fluid may drain freely from the carbuncle or intervention involving an incision and drainage procedure may be needed Carbuncles may develop anywhere but they are most common on the back and the nape of the neck A carbuncle is palpable and can range in size to be as small as a pea or as large as a golf ball The surrounding area is indurated Later skin on the centre of the carbuncle softens and peripheral satellite vesicles appear which rupture discharging pus and give rise to cribriform appearance As the impending infection develops itching may occur There may be localized erythema skin irritation and the area may be painful when touched Sometimes more severe symptoms may occur such as fatigue fever chills and general malaise as the body fights the infection
Physical Hormone secreting pituitary adenomas cause one of several forms of hyperpituitarism The specifics depend on the type of hormone Some tumors secrete more than one hormone the most common combination being GH and prolactin which present as unexpected bone growth and unexpected lactation in both men and women A patient with pituitary adenoma may present with visual field defects classically bitemporal hemianopsia It arises from the compression of the optic nerve by the tumor The specific area of the visual pathway at which compression by these tumours occurs is at the optic chiasma The anatomy of this structure causes pressure on it to produce a defect in the temporal visual field on both sides a condition called bitemporal hemianopsia If originating superior to the optic chiasm more commonly in a craniopharyngioma of the pituitary stalk the visual field defect will first appear as bitemporal inferior quadrantanopia if originating inferior to the optic chiasm the visual field defect will first appear as bitemporal superior quadrantanopia Lateral expansion of a pituitary adenoma can also compress the abducens nerve causing a lateral rectus palsy Also a pituitary adenoma can cause symptoms of increased intracranial pressure Prolactinomas often start to give symptoms especially during pregnancy when the increased hormone level estrogen can increase the tumors growth rate Various types of headaches are common in patients with pituitary adenomas The adenoma may be the prime causative factor behind the headache or may serve to exacerbate a headache caused by other factors Amongst the types of headaches experienced are both chronic and episodic migraine and more uncommonly various unilateral headaches primary stabbing headache short lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing SUNCT another type of stabbing headache characterized by short stabs of pain cluster headache and hemicrania continua HS Compressive symptoms of pituitary adenomas visual field deficits decreased visual acuity headaches are more commonly seen with macroadenomas which are greater than 10 mm in diameter than with microadenomas which are less than 10 mm in diameter Non secreting adenomas can go undetected for an extended time because no obvious abnormalities are seen the gradual reduction in normal activities due to decreased production of hormones is rather less evident For example insufficient adrenocorticotropic hormone means that the adrenal glands will not produce sufficient cortisol resulting in slow recovery from illness inflammation and chronic fatigue insufficient growth hormone in children and adolescents leads to diminished stature but which can have many other explanations
Most PVS patients are unresponsive to external stimuli and their conditions are associated with different levels of consciousness Some level of consciousness means a person can still respond in varying degrees to stimulation A person in a coma however cannot In addition PVS patients often open their eyes in response to feeding which has to be done by others they are capable of swallowing whereas patients in a coma subsist with their eyes closed Cerebral cortical function e g communication thinking purposeful movement etc is lost while brainstem functions e g breathing maintaining circulation and hemodynamic stability etc are preserved Non cognitive upper brainstem functions such as eye opening occasional vocalizations e g crying laughing maintaining normal sleep patterns and spontaneous non purposeful movements often remain intact PVS patients eyes might be in a relatively fixed position or track moving objects or move in a disconjugate i e completely unsynchronized manner They may experience sleep wake cycles or be in a state of chronic wakefulness They may exhibit some behaviors that can be construed as arising from partial consciousness such as grinding their teeth swallowing smiling shedding tears grunting moaning or screaming without any apparent external stimulus Individuals in PVS are seldom on any life sustaining equipment other than a feeding tube because the brainstem the center of vegetative functions such as heart rate and rhythm respiration and gastrointestinal activity is relatively intact
Though expressivity is varied depending on the mutation responsible for decrease in enzyme function severe cutaneous sensitivity is present in most cases of this Porphyria An estimated 30 40 of cases are due to the C73R mutation which decreases stability of the enzyme and results in 1 of its activity Exposure to long wave ultraviolet light causes the affected skin to thicken and produce vesicles that are prone to rupture and infection these secondary infections along with bone resorption can lead to disfigurement of the sun exposed face and extremities Enzyme dysfunction prevents the normal production of heme and hemolytic anemia is another common symptom though a lack of hemolysis in this disease is possible Porphyrins additionally accumulate in the bone and teeth resulting in erythrodontia When unexpected attacks occur abdominal pain as well as vomiting and constipation commonly follow the attacks Exposure to the sunlight can cause discomfort and result in blistering consciousness of heat and swelling and redness of the skin
Pulmonary infection
Zellweger syndrome is one of three peroxisome biogenesis disorders which belong to the Zellweger spectrum of peroxisome biogenesis disorders PBD ZSD The other two disorders are neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy NALD and infantile Refsum disease IRD Although all have a similar molecular basis for disease Zellweger syndrome is the most severe of these three disorders Zellweger syndrome is associated with impaired neuronal migration neuronal positioning and brain development In addition individuals with Zellweger syndrome can show a reduction in central nervous system CNS myelin particularly cerebral which is referred to as hypomyelination Myelin is critical for normal CNS functions and in this regard serves to insulate nerve fibers in the brain Patients can also show postdevelopmental sensorineuronal degeneration that leads to a progressive loss of hearing and vision Zellweger syndrome can also affect the function of many other organ systems Patients can show craniofacial abnormalities such as a high forehead hypoplastic supraorbital ridges epicanthal folds midface hypoplasia and a large fontanel hepatomegaly enlarged liver chondrodysplasia punctata punctate calcification of the cartilage in specific regions of the body eye abnormalities and renal cysts Newborns may present with profound hypotonia low muscle tone seizures apnea and an inability to eat
difficulty using the telephone loss of sound localization difficulty understanding speech especially of children and women whose voices are of a higher frequency difficulty understanding speech in the presence of background noise cocktail party effect sounds or speech sounding dull muffled or attenuated need for increased volume on television radio music and other audio sourcesHearing loss is sensory but may have accompanying symptoms
The predominant clinical symptoms of wrinkly skin syndrome are wrinkled and inelastic skin over the face backs of hands fingers tops of feet and abdomen delayed closure of the fontanel babys soft spot and increased palmar and plantar creases in the hands and feet respectively Patients may experience a wide variety of symptoms see table The assortment of symptoms displayed and symptom severity particularly growth and developmental delays vary from patient to patient
Symptoms of insomnia Difficulty falling asleep including difficulty finding a comfortable sleeping position Waking during the night being unable to return to sleep and waking up early Not able to focus on daily tasks difficulty in remembering Daytime sleepiness irritability depression or anxiety Feeling tired or having low energy during the day Trouble concentrating Being irritable acting aggressive or impulsiveSleep onset insomnia is difficulty falling asleep at the beginning of the night often a symptom of anxiety disorders Delayed sleep phase disorder can be misdiagnosed as insomnia as sleep onset is delayed to much later than normal while awakening spills over into daylight hours It is common for patients who have difficulty falling asleep to also have nocturnal awakenings with difficulty returning to sleep Two thirds of these patients wake up in the middle of the night with more than half having trouble falling back to sleep after a middle of the night awakening Early morning awakening is an awakening occurring earlier more than 30 minutes than desired with an inability to go back to sleep and before total sleep time reaches 6 5 hours Early morning awakening is often a characteristic of depression Anxiety symptoms may well lead to insomnia Some of these symptoms include tension compulsive worrying about the future feeling overstimulated and overanalyzing past events
Usually pseudoxanthoma elasticum affects the skin first often in childhood or early adolescence Small yellowish papular lesions form and cutaneous laxity mainly affect the neck axillae armpits groin and flexural creases the inside parts of the elbows and knees Skin may become lax and redundant Many individuals have oblique mental creases horizontal grooves of the chin PXE first affects the retina through a dimpling of the Bruch membrane a thin membrane separating the blood vessel rich layer from the pigmented layer of the retina that is only visible during ophthalmologic examinations This is called peau dorange a French term meaning skin of the orange Eventually the mineralization of the elastic fibers in the Bruch membrane create cracks called angioid streaks that radiate out from the optic nerve Angioid streaks themselves do not cause distortion of vision even if they cross into the foveal area This symptom is present in almost all PXE patients and is usually noticed a few years after the onset of cutaneous lesions These cracks may allow small blood vessels that were originally held back by Bruchs membrane to penetrate the retina These blood vessels sometimes leak and these retinal hemorrhages may lead to the loss of central vision Vision loss is a major issue in many PXE patients PXE may affect the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems Gastrointestinal bleeding is a rare symptom and usually involved bleeding from the stomach In the circulatory system intermittent claudication a condition in which cramping pain in the leg is induced by exercise is a prominent feature At later stages coronary artery disease may develop leading to angina and myocardial infarction heart attack Cerebral ischemia in PXE is caused by small vessel occlusive disease Other rare neurological complications may include intracranial aneurysms subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages
The most common symptoms are intellectual disability and recurrent seizures developing in infancy or early childhood Typically the seizures are resistant to treatment with anti epileptic drugs Other symptoms may include Microcephaly Lymphedema Facial abnormalities Immune deficiencies Abnormalities of retina Slow growth Short stature
Spinocerebellar ataxia SCA is one of a group of genetic disorders characterized by slowly progressive incoordination of gait and is often associated with poor coordination of hands speech and eye movements A review of different clinical features among SCA subtypes was recently published describing the frequency of non cerebellar features like parkinsonism chorea pyramidalism cognitive impairment peripheral neuropathy seizures among others As with other forms of ataxia SCA frequently results in atrophy of the cerebellum loss of fine coordination of muscle movements leading to unsteady and clumsy motion and other symptoms The symptoms of an ataxia vary with the specific type and with the individual patient In many cases a person with ataxia retains full mental capacity but progressively loses physical control
The autoimmune reaction most commonly affects the oral mucosa in the mouth causing lesions in the gums gingiva known as desquamative gingivitis More severe cases can also affect areas of mucous membrane elsewhere in the body such as the sinuses genitals anus and cornea When the cornea of the eye is affected repeated scarring may result in blindness Brunsting Perry cicatricial pemphigoid is a rare variant of mucous membrane pemphigoid involving the scalp and the neck without mucosal involvement It is proposed by some authors that this be called a variant of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita Nikolskys sign gentle lateral pressure on unaffected mucosa or skin raises a bulla If no lesions are present on examination it may be useful way of demonstrating reduced epithelial adhesion In contrast in Pemphigus the epithelium tends to disintegrate rather than form a bulla Nikolskys sign is present in pemphigus and mucous membrane pemphigoid but not in bullous pemphigoid
Umbilical granulomas appear as round pink lumps found at the base of the umbilicus after the removal of the umbilical cord It appears small pink red and moist due to cord separation They are usually 1 10 mm in size however grow in size if they are not treated Umbilical granulomas are also painless since they do not contain nerve fibers In some cases they may contain an odorless discharge or may be covered in a clear mucus The surrounding skin of the infants umbilicus site will appear normal Umbilical granulomas can become entry points for infectious agents Symptoms such as edema redness around the umbilical site pain or discomfort when the area is touched accompanied by a fever and purulent discharge may indicate sepsis or a serious infection at the umbilicus site
According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM 5 symptoms of DID include the presence of two or more distinct personality states accompanied by the inability to recall personal information beyond what is expected through normal memory issues Other DSM 5 symptoms include a loss of identity as related to individual distinct personality states loss of ones subjective experience of the passage of time and degradation of a sense of self and consciousness In each individual the clinical presentation varies and the level of functioning can change from severe impairment to minimal impairment The symptoms of dissociative amnesia are subsumed under a DID diagnosis and thus should not be diagnosed separately if DID criteria are met Individuals with DID may experience distress from both the symptoms of DID intrusive thoughts or emotions and the consequences of the accompanying symptoms dissociation rendering them unable to remember specific information The majority of patients with DID report childhood sexual or physical abuse though the accuracy of these reports is controversial Amnesia between identities may be asymmetrical identities may or may not be aware of what is known by another Individuals with DID may be reluctant to discuss symptoms due to associations with abuse shame and fear DID patients may also frequently and intensely experience time disturbances Around half of people with DID have fewer than 10 identities and most have fewer than 100 although as many as 4 500 have been reported p 503 The average number of identities has increased over the past few decades from two or three to now an average of approximately 16 However it is unclear whether this is due to an actual increase in identities or simply that the psychiatric community has become more accepting of a high number of compartmentalized memory components
Descriptions of human molybdenum deficiency are few A patient receiving prolonged parenteral nutrition acquired a syndrome described as acquired molybdenum deficiency This syndrome exacerbated by methionine administration was characterized by high blood methionine low blood uric acid and low urinary uric acid and sulfate concentrations The patient suffered mental disturbances that progressed to a coma Pathological changes occurring in individuals with a genetic disease that results in a sulfite oxidase a molybdoenzyme deficiency include increased plasma and urine sulfite sulfate thiosulfate S sulfocysteine and taurine seizures and brain atrophy lesions dislocated lenses and death at an early age
Tick paralysis results from injection of a toxin from tick salivary glands during a blood meal The toxin causes symptoms within 2 7 days beginning with weakness in both legs that progresses to paralysis The paralysis ascends to the trunk arms and head within hours and may lead to respiratory failure and death The disease can present as acute ataxia without muscle weakness Patients may report minor sensory symptoms such as local numbness but constitutional signs are usually absent Deep tendon reflexes are usually decreased or absent and ophthalmoplegia and bulbar palsy can occur Electromyographic EMG studies usually show a variable reduction in the amplitude of compound muscle action potentials but no abnormalities of repetitive nerve stimulation studies These appear to result from a failure of acetylcholine release at the motor nerve terminal level There may be subtle abnormalities of motor nerve conduction velocity and sensory action potentials
An acute exacerbation of COPD is associated with increased frequency and severity of coughing It is often accompanied by worsened chest congestion and discomfort Shortness of breath and wheezing are present in many cases Exacerbations may be accompanied by increased amount of cough and sputum productions and a change in appearance of sputum An abrupt worsening in COPD symptoms may cause rupture of the airways in the lungs which in turn may cause a spontaneous pneumothorax In infection there is often weakness fever and chills If due to a bacterial infection the sputum may be slightly streaked with blood and coloured yellow or green
Individuals with this condition usually exhibit early onset progressive hearing loss which starts around the age of 10 years old early onset optic atrophy which usually manifests in a persons mid teenage late adulthood years of life and adult onset diabetes mellitus Although rarely psychiatric symptoms can also manifest in people with the condition this group of symptoms consists of hallucinations depression anxiety and sleep disorders Psychosis and autism are sometimes seen as features of the disorder Other symptoms include nephrocalcinosis psychomotor delay glaucoma and megalocornea
Caplan syndrome presents with cough and shortness of breath in conjunction with features of rheumatoid arthritis such as painful joints and morning stiffness Examination should reveal tender swollen metacarpophalangeal joints and rheumatoid nodules auscultation of the chest may reveal diffuse crackles that do not disappear on coughing or taking a deep breath Caplan syndrome is a nodular condition of the lung occurring in dust exposed persons with either a history of rheumatoid arthritis RA or who subsequently develop RA within the following 5 10 years The nodules in the lung typically occur bilaterally and peripherally on a background of simple coal workers pneumoconiosis There are usually multiple nodules varying in size from 0 5 to 5 0 cm The nodules typically appear rapidly often in only a few weeks Nodules may grow remain unchanged in size resolve or disappear and then reappear They can cavitate calcify or develop air fluid levels Grossly they can resemble a giant silicotic nodule Histologically they usually have a necrotic center surrounded by a zone of plasma cells and lymphocytes and often with a peripheral inflammatory zone made of macrophages and neutrophils
For a person with arthritis mutilans in the hands the fingers become shortened by arthritis and the shortening may become severe enough that the hand looks paw like with the first deformity occurring at the interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints The excess skin from the shortening of the phalanx bones becomes folded transversely as if retracted into one another like opera glasses hence the description la main en lorgnette As the condition worsens luxation phalangeal and metacarpal bone absorption and skeletal architecture loss in the fingers occurs
There may be no symptoms or talaromycosis may present with small painless skin lesions The head and neck are most often affected Other features include fever general discomfort weight loss cough difficulty breathing diarrhoea abdominal pain swelling of the spleen splenomegaly liver swelling hepatomegaly swollen lymph nodes lymphadenopathy and anemia There may be no symptoms In those without HIV infection the lungs liver and mouth are usually affected with systemic infection rarely occurring The skin lesions are also often smooth The disease tends to present differently in those with HIV infection they are more likely to experience widespread infection Their skin lesions however are usually dented in the centre and can appear similar to molluscum contagiosum
Early acute hemolytic transfusion reactions are typically characterized by fever which may be accompanied by rigors chills Mild cases are also typically characterized by abdominal back flank or chest pain More severe cases may be characterized by shortness of breath low blood pressure hemoglobinuria and may progress to shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation In anesthetized or unconscious patients hematuria blood in the urine may be the first sign of AHTR Other symptoms include nausea vomiting and wheezing
Transfusional hemosiderosis can cause cardiac arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy
The most common symptoms of pancreatitis are severe upper abdominal or left upper quadrant burning pain radiating to the back nausea and vomiting that is worse with eating The physical examination will vary depending on severity and presence of internal bleeding Blood pressure may be elevated by pain or decreased by dehydration or bleeding Heart and respiratory rates are often elevated The abdomen is usually tender but to a lesser degree than the pain itself As is common in abdominal disease bowel sounds may be reduced from reflex bowel paralysis Fever or jaundice may be present Chronic pancreatitis can lead to diabetes or pancreatic cancer Unexplained weight loss may occur from a lack of pancreatic enzymes hindering digestion
Hajdu Cheney syndrome causes many issues with an individuals connective tissues Some general characteristics of an individual with Hajdu Cheney syndrome include bone flexibility and deformities short stature delayed acquisition of speech and motor skills dolichocephalic skull Wormian bone small maxilla hypoplastic frontal sinuses basilar impression joint laxity bulbous finger tips and severe osteoporosis Wormian bone occurs when extra bones appear between cranial sutures Fetuses with Hajdu Cheney syndrome often will not be seen to unclench their hands on obstetrical ultrasound They may also have low set ears and their eyes may be farther apart than on a usual child called hypertelorism Childrens heads can have some deformities in their shape and size plagiocephaly Early tooth loss and bone deformities such as serpentine tibiae and fibulae are also common in those affected
The following features are observed with VACTERL association V Vertebral anomalies A Anorectal malformations C Cardiovascular anomalies T Tracheoesophageal fistula E Esophageal atresia R Renal Kidney and or radial anomalies L Limb defectsAlthough it was not conclusive whether VACTERL should be defined by at least two or three component defects it is typically defined by the presence of at least three of the above congenital malformations
A scaphoid abdomen sucked inwards may be the presenting symptom in a newborn
The prolonged muscle contractions which occur most commonly in the leg muscles in recessive mutations and more commonly in the hands face and eyelids in dominant mutations are often enhanced by inactivity and in some forms are relieved by repetitive movement known as the warm up effect This effect often diminishes quickly with rest Some individuals with myotonia congenita are prone to falling as a result of hasty movements or an inability to stabilize themselves after a loss of balance During a fall a person with myotonia congenita may experience partial or complete rigid paralysis that will quickly resolve once the event is over However a fall into cold water may render the person unable to move for the duration of submergence As with myotonic goats children are more prone to falling than adults due to their impulsivity The two major types of myotonia congenita are distinguished by the severity of their symptoms and their patterns of inheritance Becker disease usually appears later in childhood than Thomsen disease and causes more severe myotonia muscle stiffness and transient weakness Although myotonia in itself is not normally associated with pain cramps or myalgia may develop People with Becker disease often experience temporary attacks of muscle weakness particularly in the arms and hands brought on by movement after periods of rest They may also develop mild permanent muscle weakness over time This muscle weakness is not observed in people with Thomsen disease However in recent times as more of the individual mutations that cause myotonia congenita are identified these limited disease classifications are becoming less widely used Early symptoms in a child may include Difficulty swallowing Gagging Stiff movements that improve when they are repeated Frequent falling Difficulties opening eyelids after strenuous contraction or crying von Graefes sign Possible complications may include Aspiration pneumonia caused by swallowing difficulties Frequent choking or gagging in infants also caused by swallowing difficulties Abdominal muscle weakness Chronic joint problems Injury due to falls

The most easily identifiable sign is a visible lesion of the cornea presented usually in a crescent shape Common reasons for destruction are stromal degradation and epithelial defects on the inflammatory cells There would be a change in conformation of the peripheral cornea depending on the severity of corneal thinning This process is usually accompanied by the possibility of concealing perforation The formation of an oval shaped ulcer at the margin of the cornea is also a sign Symptoms of PUK include pain redness tearing increased sensitivity to bright light impaired or blurred vision and the feeling of foreign objects trapped in the eyes
Genetics This condition has been linked to mutations in the ribosomal GTPase BMS1 gene
Symptoms include stiffness and sometimes muscle cramping after exercise and especially when exposed to cold The most commonly affected muscles are in the arms legs and eyelids Individuals with Brody myopathy also sometimes experience weakness myalgia and rhabdomyolysis
They tend to be painful due to the pressure applied to the nail bed and plate They can involve destruction of the nail bed These lesions are not true osteochondromas rather it is a reactive cartilage metaplasia The reason it occurs on the dorsal aspect is because the periosteum is loose dorsally but very tightly adherent volarly
Signs and symptoms include

The changes in fibrocystic breast disease are characterised by the appearance of fibrous tissue and a lumpy cobblestone texture in the breasts These lumps are smooth with well defined edges and free moving regarding adjacent structures These lumps can sometimes be obscured by irregularities in the breast associated with the condition Theyre often found in the upper outer sections of the breast nearest to the armpit but can be found throughout the breast Women with fibrocystic changes may experience a persistent or intermittent aching or breast tenderness related to periodic swelling Breasts and nipples may also be tender or itchy Symptoms follow a periodic trend closely tied to the menstrual cycle Symptoms tend to peak in the days to weeks before each period and decrease afterwards At peak breasts may feel full heavy swollen and tender to the touch No complications related to breastfeeding have been found
Symptoms include the breasts being swollen and oedematous and the skin appearing shiny and diffusely red Usually the whole of both breasts are affected and they are painful The woman may have a fever that usually subsides in 24 hours The nipples may become stretched tight and flat which makes it difficult for the baby to attach and remove the milk The milk does not flow well A fever may occur in 15 percent but is typically less than 39 degrees C and lasts for less than one day
This defect leads to a multi systemic disorder of the connective tissue muscles central nervous system CNS and cardiovascular system Homocystinuria represents a group of hereditary metabolic disorders characterized by an accumulation of the amino acid homocysteine in the serum and an increased excretion of homocysteine in the urine Infants appear to be normal and early symptoms if any are present are vague Signs and symptoms of homocystinuria that may be seen include the following
Many people with this disorder have a premature fusion of skull bones along the coronal suture Not every case has had craniosynostosis however Other parts of the skull may be malformed as well This will usually cause an abnormally shaped head wide set eyes low set ears and flattened cheekbones in these patients About 5 percent of affected individuals have an enlarged head macrocephaly There may also be associated hearing loss in 10 33 of cases and it is important for affected individuals to have hearing tests to check on the possibility of a problem They can lose about 33 100 of hearing Most people with this condition have normal intellect but developmental delay and learning disabilities are possible The signs and symptoms of Muenke syndrome vary among affected people and some findings overlap with those seen in other craniosynostosis syndromes Between 6 percent and 7 percent of people with the gene mutation associated with Muenke syndrome do not have any of the characteristic features of the disorder
Symptoms of herpetic whitlow include swelling reddening and tenderness of the skin of infected finger This may be accompanied by fever and swollen lymph nodes Small clear vesicles initially form individually then merge and become cloudy unlike in bacterial whitlow when there is pus Associated pain often seems largely relative to the physical symptoms The herpes whitlow lesion usually heals in two to three weeks It may reside in axillary sensory ganglia to cause recurrent herpetic lesions on that arm or digits Blistering can occur in severe cases
Complications The most common complications of QAV are aortic regurgitations This is caused by the inadequate closing of the four cusps at the end of systole The fourth dysplastic cusp is incapable of fully closing the aortic annulus which causes a backflow of blood through the aortic valve Using transthoracic echocardiograms 3 D TEE and ECG traces it is also possible to find left ventricular hypertrophy bundle branch blocks and abnormal displacement of the ostium in the right coronary artery in association with QAV Some research has shown increased incidences of atrial fibrillation to be associated but this relationship is not yet clearly established
Atypical infections are the key clinical manifestation of SGD Within the first few years of life patients will experience repeated pyogenic infections by species such as Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other Enterobacteriaceae and Candida albicans Cutaneous ulcers or abscesses and pneumonia and chronic lung disease are common Patients may also develop sepsis mastoiditis otitis media and lymphadenopathy Infants may present with vomiting diarrhea and failure to thrive Diagnosis can be made based upon CEBPE gene mutation or a pathognomonic finding of a blood smear showing lack of specific granules Neutrophils and eosinophils will contain hyposegmented nuclei a pseudo Pelger Huet anomaly
Hyperthyroidism may be asymptomatic or present with significant symptoms Some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism include nervousness irritability increased perspiration heart racing hand tremors anxiety trouble sleeping thinning of the skin fine brittle hair and muscular weakness especially in the upper arms and thighs More frequent bowel movements may occur and diarrhea is common Weight loss sometimes significant may occur despite a good appetite though 10 of people with a hyperactive thyroid experience weight gain vomiting may occur and for women menstrual flow may lighten and menstrual periods may occur less often or with longer cycles than usual Thyroid hormone is critical to normal function of cells In excess it both overstimulates metabolism and disrupts the normal functioning of sympathetic nervous system causing speeding up of various body systems and symptoms resembling an overdose of epinephrine adrenaline These include fast heartbeat and symptoms of palpitations nervous system tremor such as of the hands and anxiety symptoms digestive system hypermotility unintended weight loss and in lipid panel blood tests a lower and sometimes unusually low serum cholesterol Major clinical signs of hyperthyroidism include weight loss often accompanied by an increased appetite anxiety heat intolerance hair loss especially of the outer third of the eyebrows muscle aches weakness fatigue hyperactivity irritability high blood sugar excessive urination excessive thirst delirium tremor pretibial myxedema in Graves disease emotional lability and sweating Panic attacks inability to concentrate and memory problems may also occur Psychosis and paranoia common during thyroid storm are rare with milder hyperthyroidism Many persons will experience complete remission of symptoms 1 to 2 months after a euthyroid state is obtained with a marked reduction in anxiety sense of exhaustion irritability and depression Some individuals may have an increased rate of anxiety or persistence of affective and cognitive symptoms for several months to up to 10 years after a euthyroid state is established In addition those with hyperthyroidism may present with a variety of physical symptoms such as palpitations and abnormal heart rhythms the notable ones being atrial fibrillation shortness of breath dyspnea loss of libido amenorrhea nausea vomiting diarrhea gynecomastia and feminization Long term untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to osteoporosis These classical symptoms may not be present often in the elderly Neurological manifestations can include tremors chorea myopathy and in some susceptible individuals in particular of Asian descent periodic paralysis An association between thyroid disease and myasthenia gravis has been recognized Thyroid disease in this condition is autoimmune in nature and approximately 5 of people with myasthenia gravis also have hyperthyroidism Myasthenia gravis rarely improves after thyroid treatment and the relationship between the two entities is not well understood In Graves disease ophthalmopathy may cause the eyes to look enlarged because the eye muscles swell and push the eye forward Sometimes one or both eyes may bulge Some have swelling of the front of the neck from an enlarged thyroid gland a goiter Minor ocular eye signs which may be present in any type of hyperthyroidism are eyelid retraction stare extraocular muscle weakness and lid lag In hyperthyroid stare Dalrymple sign the eyelids are retracted upward more than normal the normal position is at the superior corneoscleral limbus where the white of the eye begins at the upper border of the iris Extraocular muscle weakness may present with double vision In lid lag von Graefes sign when the person tracks an object downward with their eyes the eyelid fails to follow the downward moving iris and the same type of upper globe exposure which is seen with lid retraction occurs temporarily These signs disappear with treatment of the hyperthyroidism Neither of these ocular signs should be confused with exophthalmos protrusion of the eyeball which occurs specifically and uniquely in hyperthyroidism caused by Graves disease note that not all exophthalmos is caused by Graves disease but when present with hyperthyroidism is diagnostic of Graves disease This forward protrusion of the eyes is due to immune mediated inflammation in the retro orbital eye socket fat Exophthalmos when present may exacerbate hyperthyroid lid lag and stare
In factitious disorder imposed on another a caregiver makes a dependent person appear mentally or physically ill in order to gain attention To perpetuate the medical relationship the caregiver systematically misrepresents symptoms fabricates signs manipulates laboratory tests or even purposely harms the dependent e g by poisoning suffocation infection physical injury It is important to note the caregiver is not performing this behavior for obvious external reward such as money Studies have shown a mortality rate of between six and ten percent making it perhaps the most lethal form of abuse In one study the average age of the affected individual at the time of diagnosis was four years old Slightly over 50 were aged 24 months or younger and 75 were under six years old The average duration from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 22 months By the time of diagnosis six percent of the affected persons were dead mostly from apnea a common result of smothering or starvation and seven percent had long term or permanent injury About half of the affected had siblings 25 of the known siblings were dead and 61 of siblings had symptoms similar to the affected or that were otherwise suspicious The mother was the perpetrator in 76 5 of the cases the father in 6 7 Most present about three medical problems in some combination of the 103 different reported symptoms The most frequently reported problems are apnea 26 8 of cases anorexia or feeding problems 24 6 of cases diarrhea 20 seizures 17 5 cyanosis blue skin 11 7 behavior 10 4 asthma 9 5 allergy 9 3 and fevers 8 6 Other symptoms include failure to thrive vomiting bleeding rash and infections Many of these symptoms are easy to fake because they are subjective A parent reporting that their child had a fever in the past 24 hours is making a claim that is impossible to prove or disprove The number and variety of presented symptoms contribute to the difficulty in reaching a proper diagnosis Aside from the motive most commonly attributed to be a gain in attention or sympathy another feature that differentiates FDIA from typical physical child abuse is the degree of premeditation involved Whereas most physical abuse entails lashing out at a child in response to some behavior e g crying bedwetting spilling food assaults on the FDIA victim tend to be unprovoked and planned Also unique to this form of abuse is the role that health care providers play by actively albeit unintentionally enabling the abuse By reacting to the concerns and demands of perpetrators medical professionals are manipulated into a partnership of child maltreatment Challenging cases that defy simple medical explanations may prompt health care providers to pursue unusual or rare diagnoses thus allocating even more time to the child and the abuser Even without prompting medical professionals may be easily seduced into prescribing diagnostic tests and therapies that may be painful costly or potentially injurious to the child If the health practitioner resists ordering further tests drugs procedures surgeries or specialists the FDIA abuser makes the medical system appear negligent for refusing to help a sick child and their selfless parent Like those with Munchausen syndrome FDIA perpetrators are known to switch medical providers frequently until they find one that is willing to meet their level of need this practice is known as doctor shopping or hospital hopping The perpetrator continues the abuse because maintaining the child in the role of patient satisfies the abusers needs The cure for the victim is to separate the child completely from the abuser When parental visits are allowed sometimes there is a disastrous outcome for the child Even when the child is removed the perpetrator may then abuse another child a sibling or other child in the family Factitious disorder imposed on another can have many long term emotional effects on a child Depending on their experience of medical interventions a percentage of children may learn that they are most likely to receive the positive parental attention they crave when they are playing the sick role in front of health care providers Several case reports describe Munchausen syndrome patients suspected of themselves having been FDIA victims Seeking personal gratification through illness can thus become a lifelong and multi generational disorder in some cases In stark contrast other reports suggest survivors of FDIA develop an avoidance of medical treatment with post traumatic responses to it The adult caregiver who has abused the child often seems comfortable and not upset over the childs hospitalization While the child is hospitalized medical professionals must monitor the caregivers visits to prevent an attempt to worsen the childs condition In addition in many jurisdictions medical professionals have a duty to report such abuse to legal authorities
It is usually considered a congenital malformation of unknown cause Since at an early stage of fetal development the penis is curved downward it has been proposed that chordee results from an arrest of penile development at that stage The curvature of a chordee can involve tethering of the skin with urethra and corpora of normal size curvature induced by fibrosis and contracture of the fascial tissue Bucks fascia or dartos surrounding the urethra disproportionately large corpora in relation to the urethral length without other demonstrable abnormality of either or a short fibrotic urethra that tethers the penis downward the least common type Severe degrees of chordee are usually associated with hypospadias but mild degrees of curvature may occur in many otherwise normal males When the curved penis is small and accompanied by hypospadias deficiency of prenatal androgen effect can be inferred
Signs and symptoms of a biotinidase deficiency can appear several days after birth These include seizures hypotonia and muscle limb weakness ataxia paresis hearing loss optic atrophy skin rashes including seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis and alopecia If left untreated the disorder can rapidly lead to coma and death Biotinidase deficiency can also appear later in life This is referred to as late onset biotinidase deficiency The symptoms are similar but perhaps more mild because if an individual survives the neonatal period they likely have some residual activity of biotin related enzymes Studies have noted individuals who were asymptomatic until adolescence or early adulthood One study pointed out that untreated individuals may not show symptoms until age 21 Furthermore in rare cases even individuals with profound deficiencies of biotinidase can be asymptomatic Symptom severity is predictably correlated with the severity of the enzyme defect Profound biotinidase deficiency refers to situations where enzyme activity is 10 or less Individuals with partial biotinidase deficiency may have enzyme activity of 10 30 Functionally there is no significant difference between dietary biotin deficiency and genetic loss of biotin related enzyme activity In both cases supplementation with biotin can often restore normal metabolic function and proper catabolism of leucine and isoleucine The symptoms of biotinidase deficiency and dietary deficiency of biotin can be quite severe A 2004 case study from Metametrix detailed the effects of biotin deficiency including aggression cognitive delay and reduced immune function
Classically ARS is divided into three main presentations hematopoietic gastrointestinal and neuro vascular These syndromes may be preceded by a prodrome The speed of symptom onset is related to radiation exposure with greater doses resulting in a shorter delay in symptom onset These presentations presume whole body exposure and many of them are markers that are invalid if the entire body has not been exposed Each syndrome requires that the tissue showing the syndrome itself be exposed e g gastrointestinal syndrome is not seen if the stomach and intestines are not exposed to radiation Some areas affected are
Common symptoms include pain intense tears eyelid twitching discomfort from bright light and constricted pupils
Myriad small cells may be seen in the aqueous humor during slit lamp examination Intraocular pressure rises up to 30 to 70 mm Hg The increased intraocular pressure may cause blurring of vision headache brow ache nausea and or vomiting The angle of anterior chamber is seen open with gonioscopy
Congenital heart defects may not show signs or symptoms until later stages of the childs life and have a delayed diagnosis
Patients with stiff person syndrome SPS experience progressive stiffness in their truncal muscles torso muscles which become rigid and stiff because the lumbar and abdominal muscles engage in constant contractions Initially stiffness occurs in the thoracolumbar paraspinal and abdominal muscles It later affects the proximal leg and abdominal wall muscles The stiffness leads to a change in posture and patients develop a rigid gait Persistent lumbar hyperlordosis often occurs as it progresses The muscle stiffness initially fluctuates sometimes for days or weeks but eventually begins to consistently impair mobility As the disease progresses patients sometimes become unable to walk or bend Chronic pain is common and worsens over time but sometimes acute pain occurs as well Stress cold weather and infections lead to an increase in symptoms and sleep decreases them SPS patients experience superimposed spasms and extreme sensitivity to touch and sound These spasms primarily occur in the proximal limb and axial muscles There are co contractions of agonist and antagonist muscles Spasms usually last for minutes and can recur over hours Attacks of spasms are unpredictable and are often caused by fast movements emotional distress or sudden sounds or touches In rare cases facial muscles hands feet and the chest can be affected and unusual eye movements and vertigo occur There are brisk stretch reflexes and clonus occurs in patients Late in the diseases progression hypnagogic myoclonus can occur Tachycardia and hypertension are sometimes also present Because of the spasms patients may become increasingly fearful require assistance and lose the ability to work leading to depression anxiety and phobias including agoraphobia and dromophobia Most patients are psychologically normal and respond reasonably to their situations Paraneoplastic SPS tends to affect the neck and arms more than other variations It progresses very quickly is more painful and is more likely to include distal pain than classic SPS Patients with paraneoplastic SPS generally lack other autoimmune issues but may have other paraneoplastic conditions Stiff limb syndrome is a variant of SPS This syndrome develops into full SPS about 25 of the time Stiffness and spasms are usually limited to the legs and hyperlordoisis generally does not occur The stiffness begins in one limb and remains most prominent there Sphincter and brainstem issues often occur with stiff limb syndrome Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity another variant of the condition includes symptoms of SPS with brainstem issues and autonomic disturbances It involves polio encephalomyelitis in the spine and brainstem There is cerebellar and brainstem involvement In some cases the limbic system is affected as well Most patients have upper motoneuron issues and autonomic disturbances Jerking SPS is another subtype of the condition It begins like classical SPS and progresses for several years up to 14 in some cases It is then distinguished by the development of myoclonus as well as seizures and ataxia in some cases
Short term effects Even in small doses stimulants cause a decrease in appetite an increase in physical activity and alertness convulsions an elevated body temperature increased respiration irregular heartbeat and increased blood pressure some of which can cause sudden death depending upon the medical history of the user even among first time users
Neuroborreliosis is often preceded by the typical symptoms of Lyme disease which include erythema migrans and flu like symptoms such as fever and muscle aches Neurologic symptoms of neuroborreliosis include the meningoradiculitis which is more common in European patients cranial nerve abnormalities and altered mental status Sensory findings may also be present Rarely a progressive form of encephalomyelitis may occur In children symptoms of neuroborreliosis include headache sleep disturbance and symptoms associated with increased intracranial pressure such as papilledema Less common childhood symptoms can include meningitis myelitis ataxia and chorea Ocular Lyme disease has also been reported as has neuroborreliosis affecting the spinal cord but neither of these findings are common
Some symptoms consistent with Becker muscular dystrophy are
Migraine typically presents with self limited recurrent severe headache associated with autonomic symptoms About 15 30 of people living with migraine experience episodes with aura and they also frequently experience episodes without aura The severity of the pain duration of the headache and frequency of attacks are variable A migraine attack lasting longer than 72 hours is termed status migrainosus There are four possible phases to a migraine attack although not all the phases are necessarily experienced The prodrome which occurs hours or days before the headache The aura which immediately precedes the headache The pain phase also known as headache phase The postdrome the effects experienced following the end of a migraine attackMigraine is associated with major depression bipolar disorder anxiety disorders and obsessive compulsive disorder These psychiatric disorders are approximately 2 5 times more common in people without aura and 3 10 times more common in people with aura
Books talk about diffuse ketarosic neoformations in palms and plants which can evolve into basal cell carcinoma These neoformations are usually yellowish
Symptoms can vary Some patients have lower often recurring abdominal pain or pelvic pain while others may be asymptomatic As tubal function is impeded infertility is a common symptom Patients who are not trying to get pregnant and have no pain may go undetected Endometriosis ruptured appendicitis and abdominal surgery sometimes are associated with the problem As a reaction to injury the body rushes inflammatory cells into the area and inflammation and later healing result in loss of the fimbria and closure of the tube These infections usually affect both Fallopian tubes and although a hydrosalpinx can be one sided the other tube on the opposite side is often abnormal By the time it is detected the tubal fluid usually is sterile and does not contain an active infection Not symptoms
HLS presents itself as various lethal developmental abnormalities which often result in either premature stillbirth or death shortly after birth Rare cases of children born with HLS surviving for several months have been noted A characteristic abnormality of HLS is an absence of brain tissue and midline structures with the presence of excess brain fluid hydrocephalus as a result of abnormal development of the central nervous system Other common defects include incomplete lung development heart defects a cleft lip or palate polydactyly and an abnormally small jaw Stillbirth and an excess of amniotic fluid polyhydramnios are common during pregnancy with a HLS affected foetus with cases of up to 8 litres cited compared to the normal 1 litre Less common symptoms such as abnormally small eyes and a broad nose are also possible
The brain requires approximately 3 3 ml of oxygen per 100 g of brain tissue per minute Initially the body responds to lowered blood oxygen by redirecting blood to the brain and increasing cerebral blood flow Blood flow may increase up to twice the normal flow but no more If the increased blood flow is sufficient to supply the brains oxygen needs then no symptoms will result However if blood flow cannot be increased or if doubled blood flow does not correct the problem symptoms of cerebral hypoxia will begin to appear Mild symptoms include difficulties with complex learning tasks and reductions in short term memory If oxygen deprivation continues cognitive disturbances and decreased motor control will result The skin may also appear bluish cyanosis and heart rate increases Continued oxygen deprivation results in fainting long term loss of consciousness coma seizures cessation of brain stem reflexes and brain death Objective measurements of the severity of cerebral hypoxia depend on the cause Blood oxygen saturation may be used for hypoxic hypoxia but is generally meaningless in other forms of hypoxia In hypoxic hypoxia 95 100 saturation is considered normal 91 94 is considered mild and 86 90 moderate Anything below 86 is considered severe Cerebral hypoxia refers to oxygen levels in brain tissue not blood Blood oxygenation will usually appear normal in cases of hypemic ischemic and hystoxic cerebral hypoxia Even in hypoxic hypoxia blood measures are only an approximate guide the oxygen level in the brain tissue will depend on how the body deals with the reduced oxygen content of the blood
Acute radiation proctopathy often causes pelvic pain diarrhea urgency and the urge to defecate despite having an empty colon tenesmus Hematochezia and fecal incontinence may occur but are less common Chronic radiation damage to the rectum 3 months may cause rectal bleeding incontinence or a change in bowel habits secondary Severe cases may lead to with strictures or fistulae formation Chronic radiation proctopathy can present at a median time of 8 12 months following radiation therapy
Most people who are infected develop sickness between 5 and 15 days after they are bitten The symptoms may include a sudden fever chills headaches muscle or joint aches and nausea A rash may also occur These symptoms usually continue for 2 to 9 days then disappear This cycle may continue for several weeks if the person is not treated
The most common conditions associated with thrombophilia are deep vein thrombosis DVT and pulmonary embolism PE which are referred to collectively as venous thromboembolism VTE DVT usually occurs in the legs and is characterized by pain swelling and redness of the limb It may lead to long term swelling and heaviness due to damage to valves in the veins The clot may also break off and migrate embolize to arteries in the lungs Depending on the size and the location of the clot this may lead to sudden onset shortness of breath chest pain palpitations and may be complicated by collapse shock and cardiac arrest Venous thrombosis may also occur in more unusual places in the veins of the brain liver portal vein thrombosis and hepatic vein thrombosis mesenteric vein kidney renal vein thrombosis and the veins of the arms Whether thrombophilia also increases the risk of arterial thrombosis which is the underlying cause of heart attacks and strokes is less well established Thrombophilia has been linked to recurrent miscarriage and possibly various complications of pregnancy such as intrauterine growth restriction stillbirth severe pre eclampsia and abruptio placentae Protein C deficiency may cause purpura fulminans a severe clotting disorder in the newborn that leads to both tissue death and bleeding into the skin and other organs The condition has also been described in adults Protein C and protein S deficiency have also been associated with an increased risk of skin necrosis on commencing anticoagulant treatment with warfarin or related drugs
Typically the signs and symptoms of juvenile nephronophthisis are limited to the kidneys They include polyuria polydipsia weakness and fatigue Anemia growth retardation no hypertension Proteinuria and hematuria are usually absent Polyuria is resistant to vasopressin When other organ systems are affected symptoms can include situs inversus heart abnormalities and liver fibrosis Juvenile nephronophthisis can also be associated with other rare disorders including Senior Løken syndrome and Joubert syndrome
The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies aPL in the absence of blood clots or pregnancy related complications does not indicate APS see below for the diagnosis of APS Antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial or venous blood clots in any organ system or pregnancy related complications In APS patients the most common venous event is deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities and the most common arterial event is stroke In pregnant person affected by APS there is an increased risk of recurrent miscarriage intrauterine growth restriction and preterm birth A frequent cause of such complications is placental infarctions In some cases APS seems to be the leading cause of intellectual and or developmental disabilities in the newborn due to an aPL induced inhibition of trophoblast differentiation The antiphospholipid syndrome is responsible for most of the miscarriages in later trimesters seen in concomitant systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy Other common findings although not part of the APS classification criteria are low platelet count heart valve disease and livedo reticularis There are also associations between antiphospholipid antibodies and different neurologic manifestations including headache migraine epilepsy and dementia Some studies have shown the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the blood and spinal fluid of patients with psychological symptoms Cancer is also observed to comorbid in patients with APS
The most obvious symptom of open pyometra is a discharge of pus from the vulva in a female that has recently been in heat However symptoms of closed pyometra are less obvious Symptoms of both types include vomiting loss of appetite depression and increased drinking and urinating Fever is seen in less than a third of female dogs with pyometra Closed pyometra is a more serious condition than open pyometra not only because there is no outlet for the infection but also because a diagnosis of closed pyometra can easily be missed due to its insidious nature Bloodwork may show dehydration and or increased white blood cell count X rays will show an enlarged uterus and ultrasound will confirm the presence of a fluid filled uterus
Facial features of children with Smith Magenis syndrome include a broad and square face deep set eyes large cheeks and a prominent jaw as well as a flat nose bridge in the young child as the child ages it becomes more ski jump shaped Eyes tend to be deep set close together and upwards slanted Eyebrows are heavy with lateral extension The mouth is the most noticeable feature both upper and lower lips are full and the mouth is wide The mouth curves downwards and the upper lip curves outwards due to a fleshy philtrum These facial features become more noticeable as the individual ages as Mandible growth outstrips that of the maxilla leading to a clear midface hypoplasia There is also a mild brachycephaly Disrupted sleep patterns are characteristic of Smith Magenis syndrome typically beginning early in life Affected individuals may be very sleepy during the day but have trouble falling asleep and awaken several times each night due to an inverted circadian rhythm of melatonin People with Smith Magenis syndrome have engaging personalities but all also have a lot of behavioral problems These behavioral problems include frequent temper tantrums meltdowns and outbursts aggression anger fidgeting compulsive behavior anxiety impulsiveness and difficulty paying attention Self harm including biting hitting head banging and skin picking is very common Behavioral complications in Smith Magenis syndrome are thought to be worsened by issues with sleeping Repetitive self hugging is a behavioral trait that may be unique to Smith Magenis syndrome People with this condition may also compulsively lick their fingers and flip pages of books and magazines a behavior known as lick and flip as well as possessing an impressive ability to recall a wide range of small details about people or subject specific trivia Other symptoms can include short stature abnormal curvature of the spine scoliosis reduced sensitivity to pain and temperature and a hoarse voice Some people with this disorder have ear abnormalities that lead to hearing loss Affected individuals may have eye abnormalities that cause nearsightedness myopia strabismus and other problems with vision Heart and kidney defects also have been reported in people with Smith Magenis syndrome though they are less common
The epileptic seizures observed in infants with West syndrome fall into three categories collectively known as infantile spasms Typically the following triad of attack types appears while the three types usually appear simultaneously they also can occur independently of each other Lightning attacks Sudden severe myoclonic convulsions of the entire body or several parts of the body in split seconds and the legs in particular are bent flexor muscle convulsions here are generally more severe than extensor ones Nodding attacks Convulsions of the throat and neck flexor muscles during which the chin is fitfully jerked towards the breast or the head is drawn inward Salaam or jackknife attacks a flexor spasm with rapid bending of the head and torso forward and simultaneous raising and bending of the arms while partially drawing the hands together in front of the chest and or flailing If one imagined this act in slow motion it would appear similar to the Muslim ceremonial greeting Salaam from which this type of attack derives its name
Characteristically there is increased mucosal bleeding heavy menstrual bleeding easy bruising nosebleeds Bleeding from the gums gastrointestinal bleeding postpartum bleeding increased postoperative bleeding The bleeding tendency is variable but may be severe Bleeding into the joints particularly spontaneous bleeds are very rare in contrast to the hemophilias Platelet numbers and morphology are normal Platelet aggregation is normal with ristocetin but impaired with other agonists such as ADP thrombin collagen or epinephrine
The patients are distinguished from those suffering from other causes of end stage renal disease by showing an absence of high blood pressure xanthochromia of palms and soles Tanchevs sign early hypochromic anemia absence of proteinuria and slow progression of kidney failure There is no specific therapy BEN causes end stage renal disease for which the only effective treatments are dialysis or a kidney transplant In endemic areas BEN is responsible for up to 70 of end stage renal disease At least 25 000 individuals are known to have this form of the disease Patients with BEN have a greatly increased rate of transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urothelial tract the renal pelvis and ureters In populations without BEN most urothelial cancer occurs in the bladder
The most common symptom of PME is myoclonus The myoclonus can be fragmented or multifocal and can be triggered by posture actions and external stimuli such as light sound and touch The type of myoclonus differs between the types of PME Other symptoms of PME include generalized tonic clonic tonic and atypical absence seizures In Laforas disease the seizures are occipital and the person experiences transient blindness as well as visual hallucinations The person may also have atypical absences and atonic and complex partial seizures In Myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers MERRF the person experiences generalized epilepsy along with myoclonus weakness and dementia As PME progresses neurological ability decreases and can lead to myopathy neuropathy cognitive decline cerebellar ataxia and dementia The different symptoms in each of the PME and between individuals makes diagnosis difficult Therefore diagnosis of PME is dependent on failure to respond to antiepileptic drugs and therapy but diagnosis of specific PME depends on genetic testing EEG electroencephalography enzyme measurements and more
A goitre can present as a palpable or visible enlargement of the thyroid gland at the base of the neck A goitre if associated with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism may be present with symptoms of the underlying disorder For hyperthyroidism the most common symptoms are associated with adrenergic stimulation tachycardia increased heart rate palpitations nervousness tremor increased blood pressure and heat intolerance Clinical manifestations are often related to hypermetabolism increased metabolism excessive thyroid hormone an increase in oxygen consumption metabolic changes in protein metabolism immunologic stimulation of diffuse goitre and ocular changes exophthalmos Hypothyroid people commonly have poor appetite cold intolerance constipation lethargy and may undergo weight gain However these symptoms are often non specific and make diagnosis difficult According to the WHO classification of goitre by palpation the severity of goitre is currently graded as grade 0 grade 1 grade 2
Because postterm pregnancy is a condition solely based on gestational age there are no confirming physical signs or symptoms While it is difficult to determine gestational age physically infants that are born postterm may be associated with a physical condition called postmaturity The most common symptoms for this condition are dry skin overgrown nails creases on the babys palms and soles of their feet minimal fat abundant hair on their head and either a brown green or yellow discoloration of their skin Doctors diagnose postmature birth based on the babys physical appearance and the length of the mothers pregnancy However some postmature babies may show no or few signs of postmaturity
Reflex seizures can be either generalized or focal seizures or both However for any given stimulus there may be a large variation in the kind of elicited seizure For example reading epilepsy may cause myoclonic jerks in the jaw or may cause focal seizures in the regions of the brain responsible for reading In reflex epilepsy generalized seizures are more common than focal seizures
There are no symptoms associated with the lesion itself although many and varied symptoms and signs may be associated with the underlying cause of immunosuppression The lesion is a white patch which almost exclusively occurs on the lateral surfaces of the tongue although rarely it may occur on the buccal mucosa soft palate pharynx or esophagus The lesion may grow to involve the dorsal surface of the tongue The texture is vertically corrugated hairy or thickly furrowed and shaggy in appearance
A filariasis such as loiasis most often consists of asymptomatic microfilaremia Some patients can develop lymphatic dysfunction causing lymphedema Episodic angioedema Calabar swellings in the arms and legs caused by immune reactions are common Calabar swellings are 3 10 cm in surface area sometimes erythematous and not pitting When chronic they can form cyst like enlargements of the connective tissue around the sheaths of muscle tendons becoming very painful when moved The swellings may last for one to three days and may be accompanied by localized urticaria skin eruptions and pruritus itching They reappear at referent locations at irregular time intervals Subconjunctival migration of an adult worm to the eyes can also occur frequently and this is the reason Loa loa is also called the African eye worm The passage over the eyeball can be sensed but it usually takes less than 15 minutes Eyeworms affect men and women equally but advanced age is a risk factor Eosinophilia is often prominent in filarial infections Dead worms may cause chronic abscesses which may lead to the formation of granulomatous reactions and fibrosis In the human host Loa loa larvae migrate to the subcutaneous tissue where they mature to adult worms in approximately one year but sometimes up to four years Adult worms migrate in the subcutaneous tissues at a speed less than 1 cm min mating and producing more microfilariae The adult worms can live up to 17 years in the human host
Symptoms can include but are not limited to lack of consciousness aggression seizures depression hemiparesis ataxia apraxia coma etc There will also be lesions in the corpus callosum
Lymphangiomatosis is a multi system disorder Symptoms depend on the organ system involved and to varying degrees the extent of the disease Early in the course of the disease patients are usually asymptomatic but over time the abnormally proliferating lymphatic channels that constitute lymphangiomatosis are capable of massive expansion and infiltration into surrounding tissues bone and organs Because of its slow course and often vague symptoms the condition is frequently under recognized or misdiagnosed Early signs of disease in the chest include wheezing cough and feeling short of breath which is often misdiagnosed as asthma The pain that accompanies bone involvement may be attributed to growing pains in younger children With bone involvement the first indication for disease may be a pathological fracture Symptoms may not raise concern or even be noted until the disease process has advanced to a point where it causes restrictive compression of vital structures Further the occurrence of chylous effusions seems to be unrelated to the pathologic burden of the disease the extent of involvement in any particular tissue or organ or the age of the patient This offers one explanation as to why unfortunately the appearance of chylous effusions in the chest or abdomen may be the first evidence of the disease Following are some of the commonly reported symptoms of lymphangiomatosis divided into the regions systems in which the disease occurs
Pain in abdomen initially left sided eventually all over Absolute constipation Enormous distension of abdomen Late vomiting and eventually dehydration Features of peritonitis Hiccup and retching may occur Tyre like feel of the abdomen is diagnostic
Both CAR and MAR share the same symptoms This is because they are both paraneoplastic syndromes AIR symptoms are numerous and shared by many other diseases
Atherosclerosis is asymptomatic for decades because the arteries enlarge at all plaque locations thus there is no effect on blood flow Even most plaque ruptures do not produce symptoms until enough narrowing or closure of an artery due to clots occurs Signs and symptoms only occur after severe narrowing or closure impedes blood flow to different organs enough to induce symptoms Most of the time patients realize that they have the disease only when they experience other cardiovascular disorders such as stroke or heart attack These symptoms however still vary depending on which artery or organ is affected Abnormalities associated with atherosclerosis begin in childhood Fibrous and gelatinous lesions have been observed in the coronary arteries of children aged 6 10 Fatty streaks have been observed in the coronary arteries of juveniles aged 11 15 though they appear at a much younger age within the aorta Clinically given enlargement of the arteries for decades symptomatic atherosclerosis is typically associated with men in their 40s and women in their 50s to 60s Sub clinically the disease begins to appear in childhood and rarely is already present at birth Noticeable signs can begin developing at puberty Though symptoms are rarely exhibited in children early screening of children for cardiovascular diseases could be beneficial to both the child and his her relatives While coronary artery disease is more prevalent in men than women atherosclerosis of the cerebral arteries and strokes equally affect both sexes Marked narrowing in the coronary arteries which are responsible for bringing oxygenated blood to the heart can produce symptoms such as chest pain of angina and shortness of breath sweating nausea dizziness or light headedness breathlessness or palpitations Abnormal heart rhythms called arrhythmias the heart beating either too slowly or too quickly are another consequence of ischemia Carotid arteries supply blood to the brain and neck Marked narrowing of the carotid arteries can present with symptoms such as a feeling of weakness being unable to think straight difficulty speaking dizziness difficulty in walking or standing up straight blurred vision numbness of the face arms and legs severe headache and loss of consciousness These symptoms are also related to stroke death of brain cells Stroke is caused by marked narrowing or closure of arteries going to the brain lack of adequate blood supply leads to the death of the cells of the affected tissue Peripheral arteries which supply blood to the legs arms and pelvis also experience marked narrowing due to plaque rupture and clots Symptoms of the narrowing are numbness within the arms or legs as well as pain Another significant location for plaque formation is the renal arteries which supply blood to the kidneys Plaque occurrence and accumulation lead to decreased kidney blood flow and chronic kidney disease which like in all other areas is typically asymptomatic until late stages According to United States data for 2004 in about 66 of men and 47 of women the first symptom of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is a heart attack or sudden cardiac death death within one hour of onset of the symptom Cardiac stress testing traditionally the most commonly performed non invasive testing method for blood flow limitations in general detects only lumen narrowing of 75 or greater although some physicians claim that nuclear stress methods can detect as little as 50 Case studies have included autopsies of U S soldiers killed in World War II and the Korean War A much cited report involved the autopsies of 300 U S soldiers killed in Korea Although the average age of the men was 22 1 years 77 3 percent had gross evidence of coronary arteriosclerosis Other studies done of soldiers in the Vietnam War showed similar results although often worse than the ones from the earlier wars Theories include high rates of tobacco use and in the case of the Vietnam soldiers the advent of processed foods after World War II
The main features of this condition are evident in skeleton and face Facial features
On ECG a left axis deviation is generally found in ostium primum ASD but an RSR pattern M pattern in V1 is characteristic Fixed splitting of the second heart sound S2 occurs because of equal filling of the left and right atria during all phases of the respiratory cycle
Symptoms of heat exhaustion include skin tingling nausea dizziness irritability headache thirst weakness vomiting high body temperature excessive sweating pupil dilation and decreased urine output
Hypermetropia Without the focusing power of the lens the eye becomes very farsighted Loss of accommodation Since the lens and its zonules are responsible for adjusting the focus of vision to different lengths patients with aphakia will have a total loss of accommodation Defective vision High degree hypermetropia and total loss of accommodation cause defective vision for both distance and near Cyanopsia Absence of lens cause cyanopsia or blue vision Some individuals have said that they perceive ultraviolet light invisible to those with a lens as whitish blue or whitish violet Erythropsia Sometimes objects appear reddish Deep anterior chamber Since lens is absent anterior chamber will be deep Iridodonesis Iridodonesis is the vibration or agitated motion of the iris with eye movement Purkinje test shows only two images the reflection from anterior and posterior corneal surfaces Iridectomy mark may be seen in surgical aphakia Astigmatism With the rule astigmatism due to corneal wound healing may occur in surgical aphakia mainly after ICCE or ECCE
AC almost always affects the lower lip and only rarely the upper lip probably because the lower lip is more exposed to the sun In the unusual cases reported where it affects the upper lip this may be due to upper lip prominence The commissures corners of the mouth are not usually involved Affected individuals may experience symptoms such as a dry sensation and cracking of the lips It is usually painless and persistent The appearance is variable White lesions indicate hyperkeratosis Red erosive or ulcerative lesions indicate atrophy loss of epithelium and inflammation Early acute lesions may be erythematous red and edematous swollen With months and years of sun exposure the lesion becomes chronic and may be grey white in color and appear dry scaly and wrinkled There is thickening whitish discoloration of the lip at the border of the lip and skin There is also a loss of the usually sharp border between the red of the lip and the normal skin known as the vermillion border The lip may become scaly and indurated as AC progresses When palpated the lip may have a texture similar to rubbing the gloved finger along sandpaper AC may occur with skin lesions of actinic keratosis or skin cancer elsewhere particularly on the head and neck since these are the most sun exposed areas Rarely it may represent a genetic susceptibility to light damage e g xeroderma pigmentosum or actinic prurigo
BPD is characterized by nine signs and symptoms To be diagnosed a person must meet at least five of the following Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment Unstable and chaotic interpersonal relationships often characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation also known as splitting Markedly disturbed sense of identity and distorted self image Impulsive or reckless behaviors e g impulsive or uncontrollable spending unsafe sex substance use disorders reckless driving binge eating Recurrent suicidal ideation or self harm Rapidly shifting intense emotional dysregulation Chronic feelings of emptiness Inappropriate intense anger that can be difficult to control Transient stress related paranoid or severe dissociative symptoms Overall the most distinguishing symptoms of BPD are pervasive patterns of instability in interpersonal relationships and self image alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation of others along with varying moods and difficulty regulating strong emotional reactions Dangerous or impulsive behavior is also correlated with the disorder Other symptoms may include feeling unsure of ones identity morals and values having paranoid thoughts when feeling stressed depersonalization and in moderate to severe cases stress induced breaks with reality or psychotic episodes Individuals with BPD often have comorbid conditions such as depressive and bipolar disorders substance use disorders eating disorders post traumatic stress disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
The disease is named for the presence of sweet smelling urine similar to maple syrup when the person goes into metabolic crisis The smell is also detected in ear wax of an affected individual during metabolic crisis In populations to whom maple syrup is unfamiliar the aroma can be likened to fenugreek and fenugreek ingestion may impart the aroma to urine Symptoms of MSUD varies between patients and is greatly related to the amount of residual enzyme activity
The first symptom is a bump formed by the bite eventually resulting in a black crusty scab Many of the symptoms are flu like including fever chills weakness and achy muscles but the most distinctive symptom is the rash that breaks out spanning the infected persons entire body
Symptoms of a dissociative fugue include mild confusion and once the fugue ends possible depression grief shame and discomfort People have also experienced a post fugue anger Another symptom of the fugue state can consist of loss of ones identity
The first signs of a parathyroid adenoma and the resulting primary hyperparathyroidism can include bone fractures and urinary calculi such as kidney stones Often a parathyroid adenoma is diagnosed by an incidental finding on blood tests that reveal high calcium levels Patients may not be experiencing any noticeable symptoms but could be producing excessive amounts of calcium and eventually experience problems later in life if untreated However if symptomatic patients can experience pain or discomfort in the joints muscles and abdomen depression and mood changes due to the hormonal imbalance constipation exhaustion and kidney damage
Nine in ten people with cerebral venous thrombosis have a headache this tends to worsen over the period of several days but may also develop suddenly thunderclap headache The headache may be the only symptom Many have symptoms of stroke inability to move one or more limbs weakness on one side of the face or difficulty speaking The neurologic deficits related to central venous thromboses does not necessarily affect one side of the body or one arterial or brain territory as is more common arterial strokes Bilateral 6th cranial nerve palsies may occur causing abnormalities related to eye movement but this is rare 40 of people have seizures although it is more common in women who develop sinus thrombosis peripartum in the period before and after giving birth These are mostly seizures affecting only one part of the body and unilateral occurring on one side but occasionally the seizures are generalised and rarely they lead to status epilepticus persistent or recurrent seizure activity for a long period of time In the elderly many of the aforementioned symptoms may not occur Common symptoms in the elderly with this condition are otherwise unexplained changes in mental status and a depressed level of consciousness The pressure around the brain may rise causing papilledema swelling of the optic disc which may be experienced as visual obscurations In severely raised intracranial pressure the level of consciousness is decreased the blood pressure rises the heart rate falls and there is abnormal posturing Focal neurologic deficits may occur hours to days after the headache in 50 of cases this may present as hemiparesis unilateral weakness if due to infarction of the frontal or parietal lobe which are drained by the vein of Trolard Focal deficits may also present as aphasia or confusion if the vein of Labbe responsible for draining the temporal lobe is affected
Signs and symptoms of an overdose vary depending on the drug or exposure to toxins The symptoms can often be divided into differing toxidromes This can help one determine what class of drug or toxin is causing the difficulties Symptoms of opioid overdoses include slow breathing heart rate and pulse Opioid overdoses can also cause pinpoint pupils and blue lips and nails due to low levels of oxygen in the blood A person experiencing an opioid overdose might also have muscle spasms seizures and decreased consciousness A person experiencing an opiate overdose usually will not wake up even if their name is called or if they are shaken vigorously
Symptoms are caused by vascular compression of the airway esophagus or both Presentation is often within the first month neonatal period and usually within the first 6 months of life Starting at birth an inspiratory and expiratory stridor high pitch noise from turbulent airflow in trachea may be present often in combination with an expiratory wheeze The severity of the stridor may depend on the patient s body position It can be worse when the baby is lying on their back rather than their side Sometimes the stridor can be relieved by extending the neck lifting the chin up Parents may notice that the baby s cry is hoarse and the breathing noisy Frequently a persistent cough is present When the airway obstruction is significant there may be episodes of severe cyanosis blue baby that can lead to unconsciousness Recurrent respiratory infections are common and secondary pulmonary secretions can further increase the airway obstruction Secondary to compression of the esophagus babies often feed poorly They may have difficulties in swallowing liquids with choking or regurgitating and increased respiratory obstruction during feeding Older patients might refuse to take solid food although most infants with severe symptoms nowadays are operated upon before they are offered solid food Occasionally patients with double aortic arches present late during later childhood or adulthood Symptoms may mimic asthma
Their colors are typically similar to that of the nearby skin Small black dots may occur on their surfaces One or more may occur in an area They may result in pain with pressure such that walking may be difficult
Almost all children with Jacobsen syndrome have intellectual disabilities which range from mild to moderate depending upon the number of the deletions of genes from the chromosome Most have delayed development including delayed speech motor disabilities and lack of coordination which makes simple activities like sitting standing and walking difficult Most children eventually start speaking but in cases with severe intellectual disability language use is highly restricted They have distinctive facial features like
If there are symptoms people with empty sella syndrome can have headaches and vision loss Additional symptoms would be associated with hypopituitarism Additional symptoms are as follows Abnormality of the middle ear ossicles Cryptorchidism Dolichocephaly Arnold Chiari type I malformation Meningocele Patent ductus arteriosus Muscular hypotonia Platybasia
SIN is associated with infertility and ectopic pregnancy and may present as either
Goiter A low amount of thyroxine one of the two thyroid hormones in the blood due to lack of dietary iodine to make it gives rise to high levels of thyroid stimulating hormone TSH which stimulates the thyroid gland to increase many biochemical processes the cellular growth and proliferation can result in the characteristic swelling or hyperplasia of the thyroid gland or goiter In mild iodine deficiency levels of triiodothyronine T3 may be elevated in the presence of low levels of levothyroxine as the body converts more of the levothyroxine to triiodothyronine as a compensation Some such patients may have a goiter without an elevated TSH The introduction of iodized salt since the early 1900s has eliminated this condition in many affluent countries however in Australia New Zealand and several European countries iodine deficiency is a significant public health problem It is more common in developing countries Public health initiatives to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease have resulted in lower discretionary salt use at the table Additionally there is a trend towards consuming more processed foods in western countries The noniodized salt used in these foods means that people are less likely to obtain iodine from adding salt during cooking Goiter is said to be endemic when the prevalence in a population is 5 and in most cases goiter can be treated with iodine supplementation If goiter is untreated for around five years however iodine supplementation or thyroxine treatment may not reduce the size of the thyroid gland because the thyroid is permanently damaged
Symptoms in people with Treacher Collins syndrome vary Some individuals are so mildly affected that they remain undiagnosed while others have moderate to severe facial involvement and life threatening airway compromise Most of the features of TCS are symmetrical and are already recognizable at birth The most common symptom of Treacher Collins syndrome is underdevelopment of the lower jaw and underdevelopment of the zygomatic bone This can be accompanied by the tongue being retracted The small mandible can result in a poor occlusion of the teeth or in more severe cases trouble breathing or swallowing The respiratory system of a child with Treacher Collins syndrome is the primary concern at birth with other issues only addressed once respiratory function has been stabilized Underdevelopment of the zygomatic bone gives the cheeks a sunken appearance The external ear is sometimes small rotated malformed or absent entirely in people with TCS Symmetric bilateral narrowing or absence of the external ear canal is also described In most cases the bones of the middle ear and the middle ear cavity are misshapen Inner ear malformations are rarely described As a result of these abnormalities a majority of the individuals with TCS have conductive hearing loss Most affected people also experience eye problems including coloboma notches in the lower eyelids partial or complete absence of eyelashes on the lower lid downward angled eyelids drooping of upper and lower eyelids and narrowing of the tear ducts Vision loss can occur and is associated with strabismus refractive errors and anisometropia It can also be caused by severely dry eyes a consequence of lower eyelid abnormalities and frequent eye infections Although an abnormally shaped skull is not distinctive for Treacher Collins syndrome brachycephaly with bitemporal narrowing is sometimes observed Cleft palate is also common Dental anomalies are seen in 60 of affected people including tooth agenesis 33 discoloration enamel opacities 20 malplacement of the maxillary first molars 13 and wide spacing of the teeth In some cases dental anomalies in combination with mandible hypoplasia result in a malocclusion This can lead to problems with food intake and the ability to close the mouth Less common features of TCS may add to an affected persons breathing problems including sleep apnea Choanal atresia or stenosis is a narrowing or absence of the choanae the internal opening of the nasal passages which may also be observed Underdevelopment of the pharynx can also narrow the airway Features related to TCS that are seen less frequently include nasal deformities high arched palate macrostomia preauricular hair displacement cleft palate hypertelorism notched upper eyelid and congenital heart defects Although facial deformity is often associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability more than 95 of people affected with TCS have normal intelligence The psychological and social problems associated with facial deformity can affect quality of life in individuals with TCS
Symptoms of ototoxicity include partial or profound hearing loss vertigo and tinnitus The cochlea is primarily a hearing structure situated in the inner ear It is the snail shaped shell containing several nerve endings that makes hearing possible Ototoxicity typically results when the inner ear is poisoned by medication that damages the cochlea vestibule semi circular canals or the auditory vestibulocochlear nerve The damaged structure then produces the symptoms the patient presents with Ototoxicity in the cochlea may cause hearing loss of the high frequency pitch ranges or complete deafness or losses at points between It may present with bilaterally symmetrical symptoms or asymmetrically with one ear developing the condition after the other or not at all The time frames for progress of the disease vary greatly and symptoms of hearing loss may be temporary or permanent The vestibule and semi circular canal are inner ear components that comprise the vestibular system Together they detect all directions of head movement Two types of otolith organs are housed in the vestibule the saccule which points vertically and detects vertical acceleration and the utricle which points horizontally and detects horizontal acceleration The otolith organs together sense the heads position with respect to gravity when the body is static then the heads movement when it tilts and pitch changes during any linear motion of the head The saccule and utricle detect different motions which information the brain receives and integrates to determine where the head is and how and where it is moving The semi circular canals are three bony structures filled with fluid As with the vestibule the primary purpose of the canals is to detect movement Each canal is oriented at right angles to the others enabling detection of movement in any plane The posterior canal detects rolling motion or motion about the X axis the anterior canal detects pitch or motion about the Y axis the horizontal canal detects yaw motion or motion about the Z axis When a medication is toxic in the vestibule or the semi circular canals the patient senses loss of balance or orientation rather than losses in hearing Symptoms in these organs present as vertigo difficulties walking in low light and darkness disequilibrium oscillopsia among others Each of these problems is related to balance and the mind is confused with the direction of motion or lack of motion Both the vestibule and semi circular canals transmit information to the brain about movement when these are poisoned they are unable to function properly which results in miscommunication with the brain When the vestibule and or semi circular canals are affected by ototoxicity the eye can also be affected Nystagmus and oscillopsia are two conditions that overlap the vestibular and ocular systems These symptoms cause the patient to have difficulties with seeing and processing images The body subconsciously tries to compensate for the imbalance signals being sent to the brain by trying to obtain visual cues to support the information it is receiving This results in that dizziness and woozy feeling patients use to describe conditions such as oscillopsia and vertigo Cranial nerve VIII is the least affected component of the ear when ototoxicity arises but if the nerve is affected the damage is most often permanent Symptoms present similar to those resulting from vestibular and cochlear damage including tinnitus ringing of the ears difficulty walking deafness and balance and orientation issues
The infection often has no symptoms until the patient develops an aneurysm because of the aortic dilatation The disease is often discovered after a routine checkup of the heart and aorta Although is easy to be overlooked other symptoms of tertiary syphilis might appear such as gummas and symptoms of neurosyphilis headache stiff neck gait abnormality dementia etc Additionally in rare cases chest pain and shortness of breath might appear as a result of the damage of the aorta and heart valve
Because the TVCs entry point usually is the site of a trauma wound or puncture in the skin during an autopsy for example the most frequent site for the wart are the hands But it can occur anywhere in the skin such as in the sole of the feet in the anus and in the case of children from developing countries in the buttocks and knees This is because children from countries of high incidence of tuberculosis can contract the lesion after contact with tuberculous sputum by walking barefoot sitting or playing on the ground When recent the skin lesion has the outside appearance of a wart or verruca thus it can be confused with other kinds of warts It evolves to an annular red brown plaque with time with central healing and gradual expansion in the periphery In this phase it can be confused with fungal infections such as blastomycosis and chromoblastomycosis
Diagnosis of mild DDS is often complicated by other dialysis complications such as malignant hypertension uremia encephalopathy subdural hemorrhage hyper and hypoglycaemia or electrolyte imbalances Presentation of moderate and severe DDS requires immediate identification and treatment as the condition can result in severe neurological issues and death 1 Headache 2 Nausea 3 Dizziness 4 Confusion 5 Visual disturbance 6 Tremor 7 Seizures 8 Coma
Up to 10 of women with ectopic pregnancy have no symptoms and one third have no medical signs In many cases the symptoms have low specificity and can be similar to those of other genitourinary and gastrointestinal disorders such as appendicitis salpingitis rupture of a corpus luteum cyst miscarriage ovarian torsion or urinary tract infection Clinical presentation of ectopic pregnancy occurs at a mean of 7 2 weeks after the last normal menstrual period with a range of four to eight weeks Later presentations are more common in communities deprived of modern diagnostic ability Signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy include increased hCG vaginal bleeding in varying amounts sudden lower abdominal pain pelvic pain a tender cervix an adnexal mass or adnexal tenderness In the absence of ultrasound or hCG assessment heavy vaginal bleeding may lead to a misdiagnosis of miscarriage Nausea vomiting and diarrhea are more rare symptoms of ectopic pregnancy Rupture of an ectopic pregnancy can lead to symptoms such as abdominal distension tenderness peritonism and hypovolemic shock A woman with ectopic pregnancy may be excessively mobile with upright posturing in order to decrease intrapelvic blood flow which can lead to swelling of the abdominal cavity and cause additional pain
Lymphoma may present with certain nonspecific symptoms if the symptoms are persistent an evaluation to determine their cause including possible lymphoma should be undertaken
Individuals with exploding head syndrome hear or experience loud imagined noises as they are falling asleep or waking up have a strong often frightened emotional reaction to the sound and do not report significant pain around 10 of people also experience visual disturbances like perceiving visual static lightning or flashes of light Some people may also experience heat strange feelings in their torso or a feeling of electrical tinglings that ascends to the head before the auditory hallucinations occur With the heightened arousal people experience distress confusion myoclonic jerks tachycardia sweating and the sensation that feels as if they have stopped breathing and have to make a deliberate effort to breathe again The pattern of the auditory hallucinations is variable Some people report having a total of two or four attacks followed by a prolonged or total remission having attacks over the course of a few weeks or months before the attacks spontaneously disappear or the attacks may even recur irregularly every few days weeks or months for much of a lifetime
Symptoms may include abdominal pain chest pain chest pain similar to pleuritic pain when stomach bladder or bowels are full back pain early satiety due to splenic encroachment or the symptoms of anemia due to accompanying cytopenia Signs of splenomegaly may include a palpable left upper quadrant abdominal mass or splenic rub It can be detected on physical examination by using Castells sign Traubes space percussion or Nixons sign but an ultrasound can be used to confirm diagnosis In patients where the likelihood of splenomegaly is high the physical exam is not sufficiently sensitive to detect it abdominal imaging is indicated in such patients In cases of infectious mononucleosis splenomegaly is a common symptom and health care providers may consider using abdominal ultrasonography to get insight into a persons condition However because spleen size varies greatly ultrasonography is not a valid technique for assessing spleen enlargement and should not be used in typical circumstances or to make routine decisions about fitness for playing sports
IMT was regarded as a tumor that occurs in children or young adults and presented in the lung mesentery greater omentum or less commonly heart liver spleen pancreas colon small intestine spermatic cord prostate uterus eye orbit peripheral or central nervous system nerves brain meninges spinal cord or other sites However a more recent retrospective study of 92 patients accumulated by the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER program of the National Cancer Institute found the mean age of disease onset was 47 4 years with peak occurrences at 0 to 4 36 to 40 and 50 years old middle aged individuals 41 to 64 years represented 1 3 of all cases In this study the commonest sites of tumor occurrence were the lower limb and hip 22 of cases upper limb and shoulder 12 of cases and head face and neck 9 of cases Another recent study of 25 patients found the commonest sites of IMT were the abdomen 40 of cases and lung thoracic wall 32 of cases Individual IMT cases are also reported to present in the urinary bladder anal canal and parameningeal spaces i e sites adjacent to the meninges such as the nasopharynx middle ear paranasal sinuses infratemporal fossa and pterygopalatine fossa Apparently the age and organ tissue distribution of IMT various with the patient population examined in general it can present in individuals of almost any age and in almost any organ or tissue site IMT most commonly presents as a tumor localized to a single site but may be associated with distal metastases in up to 5 of all cases or up to 10 of cases in which the tumor cells express an ALK fusion protein The tumors range in size from 1 25 cm average 6 5 cm with two thirds being 1 5 6 5 cm In rare cases the tumors have spontaneously regressed Individuals with IMT present with a wide range of symptoms e g pain swelling a mass organ dysfunction etc depending on the tumor location s Up to 1 3 of these individuals have symptoms of systemic inflammation such as fever chills night sweats and weight loss Rare cases of IMT have developed in individuals with a organizing pneumonia b infection by Mycobacterium avium intracellulare or Corynebacterium equi pneumonia causing bacteria Campylobacter jejuni causes gastroenteritis Lysinibacillus sphaericus previously termed Bacillus sphaericus a rare cause of lung infections and sepsis Coxiella burneti causes Q fever Epstein Barr virus causes infectious mononucleosis and Epstein Barr virus associated lymphoproliferative malignant diseases and E coli related occlusive phlebitis of intrahepatic veins or c previous abdominal surgery trauma ventriculoperitoneal shunt in the brain radiation therapy and corticosteroid usage The relationship i e cause or merely association of these disease relationships to IMT is unknown
Lesions of erythrasma are initially pink but progress quickly to become brown and scaly as skin starts to shed which are sharply distinguished Erythrasmic patches are typically found in moist and intertriginous areas skin fold areas e g armpit groin under breast and can be well defined patches or irregular The most common is interdigital erythrasma which is of the foot and may present as a scaling fissuring and chronic non resolving break down of the toe web interspaces The slightly webbed spaces between toes or other body region skin folds make it difficult to distinguish from various Tinea The patient is commonly otherwise asymptomatic
People with CIP CIM have diffuse symmetric flaccid muscle weakness CIP CIM typically develops in the setting of a critical illness and immobilization so patients with CIP CIM are often receiving treatment in the intensive care unit ICU Weakness motor deficits occurs in generalized fashion rather than beginning in one region of the body and spreading Limb and respiratory diaphragm muscles are especially affected The muscles of the face are usually spared but in rare cases the eye muscles may be weakened leading to ophthalmoplegia Respiratory difficulties can be caused by atrophy of the muscles between the ribs intercostals atrophy of the diaphragm muscle and degeneration of the nerve that stimulates the diaphragm phrenic nerve This can prolong the time it takes to wean a person off of a breathing machine mechanical ventilation by as much as 7 13 days Deep tendon reflexes may be lost or diminished and there may be bilateral symmetric flaccid paralysis of the arms and legs The nervous system manifestations are typically limited to peripheral nerves as the central nervous system is usually unaffected
OCD can present with a wide variety of symptoms Certain groups of symptoms usually occur together these groups are sometimes viewed as dimensions or clusters which may reflect an underlying process The standard assessment tool for OCD the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Y BOCS has 13 predefined categories of symptoms These symptoms fit into three to five groupings A meta analytic review of symptom structures found a four factor grouping structure to be most reliable a symmetry factor a forbidden thoughts factor a cleaning factor and a hoarding factor The symmetry factor correlates highly with obsessions related to ordering counting and symmetry as well as repeating compulsions The forbidden thoughts factor correlates highly with intrusive and distressing thoughts of a violent religious or sexual nature The cleaning factor correlates highly with obsessions about contamination and compulsions related to cleaning The hoarding factor only involves hoarding related obsessions and compulsions and was identified as being distinct from other symptom groupings Some OCD subtypes have been associated with improvement in performance on certain tasks such as pattern recognition washing subtype and spatial working memory obsessive thought subtype Subgroups have also been distinguished by neuroimaging findings and treatment response though neuroimaging studies have not been comprehensive enough to draw conclusions Subtype dependent treatment response has been studied and the hoarding subtype has consistently been least responsive to treatment While OCD is considered a homogeneous disorder from a neuropsychological perspective many of the symptoms may be the result of comorbid disorders For example adults with OCD have exhibited more symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD and autism spectrum disorder ASD than adults without OCD
The core symptoms of depersonalization derealization disorder is the subjective experience of unreality in ones self or detachment from ones surroundings People who are diagnosed with depersonalization also often experience an urge to question and think critically about the nature of reality and existence Individuals with depersonalization describe feeling disconnected from their physicality feeling as if they are not completely occupying their own body feeling as if their speech or physical movements are out of their control feeling detached from their own thoughts or emotions and experiencing themselves and their lives from a distance While depersonalization involves detachment from ones self individuals with derealization feel detached from their surroundings as if the world around them is foggy dreamlike or visually distorted Individuals with the disorder commonly describe a feeling as though time is passing them by and they are not in the notion of the present In some cases individuals may be unable to accept their reflection as their own or they may have out of body experiences One third to one half of patients with DPDR also experience hearing internal voices This is to differentiate from external voices which are more commonly found in psychosis Additionally some individuals experience difficulty concentrating and problems with memory retrieval These individuals sometimes lack the feeling of a memory where they are able to recall a memory but feel as if they did not personally experience it These experiences which strike at the core of a persons identity and consciousness may cause a person to feel uneasy or anxious The inner turmoil created by the disorder can also result in depression First experiences with depersonalization may be frightening with patients fearing loss of control dissociation from the rest of society and functional impairment The majority of people with depersonalization derealization disorder misinterpret the symptoms thinking that they are signs of serious psychosis or brain dysfunction This commonly leads to an increase of anxiety and obsession which contributes to the worsening of symptoms Factors that tend to diminish symptoms are comforting personal interactions intense physical or emotional stimulation and relaxation Distracting oneself by engaging in conversation or watching a movie for example may also provide temporary relief Some other factors that are identified as relieving symptom severity are diet or exercise while alcohol and fatigue are listed by some as worsening their symptoms Occasional brief moments of mild depersonalization can be experienced by many members of the general population however depersonalization derealization disorder occurs when these feelings are strong severe persistent or recurrent and when these feelings interfere with daily functioning DPDR episodes tend to be transient but duration is highly variable with some lasting as long as several weeks A growing number of users participating in virtual reality VR are facing the hazard of DPDR with dissociative experiences after use Higher levels of a lessened sense of reality and being easily immersed can occur
African trypanosomiasis symptoms occur in two stages the hemolymphatic stage and the neurological stage the latter being characterised by parasitic invasion of the central nervous system Neurological symptoms occur in addition to the initial features however and the two stages may be difficult to distinguish based on clinical features alone The disease has been reported to present with atypical symptoms in infected individuals who originate from non endemic areas e g travelers The reasons for this are unclear and may be genetic The low number of such cases may also have skewed findings In such persons the infection is said to present mainly as fever with gastrointestinal symptoms e g diarrhoea and jaundice with lymphadenopathy developing only rarely Trypanosomal chancre Systemic disease is sometimes presaged by a trypanosomal chancre developing at the site of the infectious fly bite within 2 days of infection The chancre is most commonly observed in T b rhodesiense infection and only rarely in T b gambiense however in T b gambiense infection chancres are more common in persons from non endemic areas
Near vision will be blurred and asthenopic symptoms like head ache and eye strain may occur while reading Reduction of amplitude of accommodation by 2 dioptre or more is one of the important sign
Tonic clonic seizures seizures with repetitive sequences of stiffening and jerking of the extremities Myoclonic seizures seizures with rapid brief contractions of muscles Atonic seizures seizures with a sudden loss of muscle tone often resulting in sudden collapse These are also called drop seizures or astatic seizures Absence seizures a generalized seizure characterized by staring off and occasionally some orofacial automatisms Myoclonic astatic seizures seizures that involve a myoclonic seizure followed immediately by an atonic seizure This type of seizure is exclusive to MAE and is one of the defining characteristics of this syndrome Tonic seizures muscle stiffening or rigidity This seizure is rare in this syndrome
The epidermoid cyst may have no symptoms or it may be painful when touched It can release macerated keratin In contrast to pilar cysts epidermoid cysts are usually present on parts of the body with relatively little hair An epidermoid cyst is one type of vaginal cysts Although they are not malignant there are rare cases of malignant tumors arising from an epidermoid cyst Epidermal inclusion cysts account for approximately 85 95 of all excised cysts malignant transformation is exceedingly rare The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma developing from an epidermal inclusion cyst has been estimated to range from 0 011 to 0 045
In simple words when there is excessive pressure within the lower pharynx the weakest portion of the pharyngeal wall balloons out forming a diverticulum which may reach several centimetres in diameter More precisely while traction and pulsion mechanisms have long been deemed the main factors promoting development of a Zenkers diverticulum current consensus considers occlusive mechanisms to be most important uncoordinated swallowing impaired relaxation and spasm of the cricopharyngeus muscle lead to an increase in pressure within the distal pharynx so that its wall herniates through the point of least resistance known as Killians triangle located superior to the cricopharyngeus muscle and inferior to the thyropharyngeus muscle Thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus are the superior and inferior parts of inferior constrictor muscle of pharynx respectively The result is an outpouching of the posterior pharyngeal wall just above the esophagus While it may be asymptomatic Zenker diverticulum can present with the following symptoms
Mucolipidosis II ML II is a particularly severe form of ML that has a significant resemblance to another mucopolysaccharidosis called Hurler syndrome Generally only laboratory testing can distinguish the two as the presentation is so similar with high plasma concentrations of lysosomal enzymes often fatal in childhood Typically by the age of 6 months failure to thrive and developmental delays are obvious signs of this disorder Some physical signs such as abnormal skeletal development coarse facial features and restricted joint movement may be present at birth Children with ML II usually have enlargement of certain organs such as the liver hepatomegaly or spleen splenomegaly and sometimes even the heart valves Affected children often have stiff claw shaped hands and fail to grow and develop in the first months of life Delays in the development of their motor skills are usually more pronounced than delays in their cognitive mental processing skills Children with ML II eventually develop a clouding on the cornea of their eyes and because of their lack of growth develop short trunk dwarfism underdeveloped trunk These young patients are often plagued by recurrent respiratory tract infections including pneumonia otitis media middle ear infections bronchitis and carpal tunnel syndrome Children with ML II generally die before their seventh year of life often as a result of congestive heart failure or recurrent respiratory tract infections
Streptococcal intertrigo commonly presents with a beefy red smooth shiny lesion that has well defined borders There are no satellite lesions surrounding the area and a distinct foul smell is common The infection may be accompanied by general malaise and a low grade fever The folds of the neck are most commonly affected but other areas with skin folds are also susceptible including the armpits groin and anus
Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease including loss of appetite nausea vomiting itching sleepiness or confusion weight loss and an unpleasant taste in the mouth may develop
Due to the low oxygen saturation of the blood cyanosis will appear in peripheral areas around the mouth and lips fingertips and toes these areas are furthest from the heart and since the circulated blood is not fully oxygenated to begin with very little oxygen reaches the peripheral arteries A d TGA baby will exhibit indrawing beneath the ribcage and comfortable tachypnea rapid breathing this is likely a homeostatic reflex of the autonomic nervous system in response to hypoxic hypoxia The infant will be easily fatigued and may experience weakness particularly during feeding or playing this interruption to feeding combined with hypoxia can cause failure to thrive If d TGA is not diagnosed and corrected early on the infant may eventually experience syncopic episodes and develop clubbing of the fingers and toes
Stress fractures are typically discovered after a rapid increase in exercise Symptoms usually have a gradual onset with complaints that include isolated pain along the shaft of the bone and during activity decreased muscular strength and cramping In cases of fibular stress fractures pain occurs proximal to the lateral malleolus that increases with activity and subsides with rest If pain is constantly present it may indicate a more serious bone injury There is usually an area of localized tenderness on or near the bone and generalized swelling in the area Pressure applied to the bone may reproduce symptoms and reveal crepitus in well developed stress fractures Anterior tibial stress fractures elicit focal tenderness on the anterior tibial crest while posterior medial stress fractures can be tender at the posterior tibial border
There are three distinct types of lymphangioma each with their own symptoms They are distinguished by the depth and the size of abnormal lymph vessels but all involve a malformation of the lymphic system Lymphangioma circumscriptum can be found on the skins surface and the other two types of lymphangiomas occur deeper under the skin Lymphangioma circumscriptum a microcystic lymphatic malformation resembles clusters of small blisters ranging in color from pink to dark red They are benign and do not require medical treatment although some patients may choose to have them surgically removed for cosmetic reasons Cavernous lymphangiomas are generally present at birth but may appear later in the childs life These bulging masses occur deep under the skin typically on the neck tongue and lips and vary widely in size ranging from as small as a centimeter in diameter to several centimeters wide In some cases they may affect an entire extremity such as a hand or foot Although they are usually painless the patient may feel mild pain when pressure is exerted on the area They come in the colors white pink red blue purple and black and the pain lessens the lighter the color of the bump Cystic hygroma shares many commonalities with cavernous lymphangiomas and some doctors consider them to be too similar to merit separate categories However cystic lymphangiomas usually have a softer consistency than cavernous lymphangiomas and this term is typically the one that is applied to lymphangiomas that develop in fetuses They usually appear on the neck 75 arm pit or groin areas They often look like swollen bulges underneath the skin
The clinical manifestation is similar to neurogenic diabetes insipidus presenting with polydipsia excessive thirst and polyuria excretion of a large amount of dilute urine Dehydration is common and incontinence can occur secondary to chronic bladder distension On investigation there will be an increased plasma osmolarity and decreased urine osmolarity As pituitary function is normal antidiuretic hormone levels are likely to be abnormal or raised Polyuria will continue as long as the patient is able to drink If the patient is unable to drink and is still unable to concentrate the urine then hypernatremia will ensue with its neurologic symptoms
Signs and symptoms are usually detectable prenatally or shortly after birth In its severe manifestations MSMDS has been associated with prune belly sequence In less severe forms the earliest signs of MSMDS are congenital fixed mydriasis can be misdiagnosed as partial aniridia and a PDA requiring surgical intervention Most carriers of the mutation will eventually develop thoracic arterial disease between the ages of 10 25
Itchiness a burning sensation pus discharge blood and swelling in around the rectum and anus diarrhea Other common symptoms include anal spasm Bleeding with defecation and painful defecation
Being an extremely rare autosomal genetic disorder differential diagnosis has only led to several cases since 1972 Initial diagnosis lends itself to facial abnormalities including sloping forehead maxillary hypoplasia nasal bridge depression wide mouth dental malocclusion and receding chin Electroencephalography EEG computed tomography CT scanning and skeletal survey are further required for confident diagnosis Commonly diffuse cartilage calcification and brachytelephalangism are identified by X radiation X ray while peripheral pulmonary arterial stenosis hearing loss dysmorphic facies and mental retardation are confirmed with confidence by the aforementioned diagnostic techniques
The nerve dysfunction induces esotropia a convergent squint on distance fixation On near fixation the affected individual may have only a latent deviation and be able to maintain binocularity or have an esotropia of a smaller size Patients sometimes adopt a face turned towards the side of the affected eye moving the eye away from the field of action of the affected lateral rectus muscle with the aim of controlling diplopia and maintaining binocular vision Diplopia is typically experienced by adults with VI nerve palsies but children with the condition may not experience diplopia due to suppression The neuroplasticity present in childhood allows the child to switch off the information coming from one eye in this case the esotropic eye thus relieving any diplopic symptoms Whilst this is a positive adaptation in the short term in the long term it can lead to a lack of appropriate development of the visual cortex giving rise to permanent visual loss in the suppressed eye a condition known as amblyopia or Lazy eye
The condition most commonly is located at the junction of the hard and soft palate However the condition may arise anywhere minor salivary glands are located It has also been occasionally reported to involve the major salivary glands It may be present only on one side or both sides The lesion typically is 1 4 cm in diameter Initially the lesion is a tender erythematous red swelling Later in the ulcerated stage the overlying mucosa breaks down to leave a deep well circumscribed ulcer which is yellow gray in color and has a lobular base There is usually only minor pain and the condition is often entirely painless There may be prodromal symptoms similar to flu before the appearance of the lesion
FHM signs overlap significantly with those of migraine with aura In short FHM is typified by migraine with aura associated with hemiparesis and in FHM1 cerebellar degeneration which can result in episodic or progressive ataxia FHM can also present with the same signs as benign familial infantile convulsions and alternating hemiplegia of childhood Other symptoms are altered consciousness in fact some cases seem related to head trauma gaze evoked nystagmus and coma Aura symptoms such as numbness and blurring of vision typically persist for 30 60 minutes but can last for weeks to months An attack resembles a stroke but unlike a stroke it resolves in time These signs typically first manifest themselves in the first or second decade of life
Iodine deficiency causes gradual enlargement of the thyroid gland referred to as a goiter Poor length growth is apparent as early as the first year of life Adult stature without treatment ranges from 100 to 160 cm 3 ft 3 in to 5 ft 3 in depending on severity sex and other genetic factors Other signs include thickened skin hair loss enlarged tongue and a protruding abdomen In children bone maturation and puberty are severely delayed In adults ovulation is impeded and infertility is common Mental deterioration is common Neurological impairment may be mild with reduced muscle tone and coordination or so severe that the person cannot stand or walk Cognitive impairment may also range from mild to so severe that the person is nonverbal and dependent on others for basic care Thought and reflexes are slower
The hallmark of a stone that obstructs the ureter or renal pelvis is excruciating intermittent pain that radiates from the flank to the groin or to the inner thigh This is due to the transfer of referred pain signals from the lower thoracic splanchnic nerves to the lumbar splanchnic nerves as the stone passes down from the kidney or proximal ureter to the distal ureter This pain known as renal colic is often described as one of the strongest pain sensations known Renal colic caused by kidney stones is commonly accompanied by urinary urgency restlessness hematuria sweating nausea and vomiting It typically comes in waves lasting 20 to 60 minutes caused by peristaltic contractions of the ureter as it attempts to expel the stone The embryological link between the urinary tract the genital system and the gastrointestinal tract is the basis of the radiation of pain to the gonads as well as the nausea and vomiting that are also common in urolithiasis Postrenal azotemia and hydronephrosis can be observed following the obstruction of urine flow through one or both ureters Pain in the lower left quadrant can sometimes be confused with diverticulitis because the sigmoid colon overlaps the ureter and the exact location of the pain may be difficult to isolate due to the proximity of these two structures
Affected children display severe psychomotor impairment failure to thrive seizures and muscle spasticity or hypotonia Other symptoms of the disorder may include unusual facial appearance difficulty swallowing and anomalies of the hands fingers or toes Symptoms of lissencephaly are detected via ultrasound at about twenty three weeks and require confirmation from a prenatal MRI It is characterised by absence or reduction of the sulci and gyri of the cerebral surface and a thickened cortex There are anatomical symptoms that differ across the two main types of lissencephaly Classical Type I and Cobble Stone Type 2 In Classical lissencephaly the cortex becomes thickened and can be identified by four layers of the cerebral cortex rather than six Cobblestone lissencephaly is named after the pebbled or cobblestone appearance of the cortical surface This uneven cortical surface is due to incomplete organogenesis which leads to no distinguishable layers in the cerebral cortex Cobblestone lissencephaly shows a reduction and abnormalities in the grey matter of the cerebral cortex
Bardet Biedl syndrome is a pleiotropic disorder with variable expressivity and a wide range of clinical variability observed both within and between families The most common clinical features are rod cone dystrophy with childhood onset night blindness followed by increasing visual loss postaxial polydactyly truncal obesity that manifests during infancy and remains problematic throughout adulthood varying degrees of learning disabilities male hypogenitalism and complex female genitourinary malformations and renal dysfunction a major cause of morbidity and mortality There is a wide range of secondary features that are sometimes associated with BBS 147 148 including 153 154 Strabismus cataracts astigmatism pigmentary retinopathy poor visual acuity low vision and or blindness caused by an impaired photoreceptor transport mechanism in the retina Brachydactyly syndactyly of both the hands and feet is common as is partial syndactyl most usually between the second and third toes Polyuria polydipsia nephrogenic diabetes insipidus Ataxia poor coordination imbalance Mild hypertonia especially lower limbs Diabetes mellitus Hepatic involvement Anosmia Auditory deficiencies Hirschsprung disease and subsequent bowel obstruction has been described Hypertrophy of interventricular septum and left ventricle and dilated cardiomyopathy Hypogonadism kidney failure urogenital sinuses ectopic urethra uterus duplex septate vagina and hypoplasia of the uterus ovaries and fallopian tubes Speech disorder delay Developmental delay especially of fine and gross motor skills
Characteristics may vary according to the subtype of pustular psoriasis For example it can be localized commonly to the hands and feet localized pustular psoriasis or generalized with widespread patches appearing randomly on any part of the body generalized pustular psoriasis However all forms of pustular psoriasis share in common the presence of red and tender blotchy skin covered with pustules Pustular psoriasis can be localized commonly to the hands and feet palmoplantar pustulosis or generalized with widespread patches occurring randomly on any part of the body Acrodermatitis continua is a form of localized psoriasis limited to the fingers and toes that may spread to the hands and feet Pustulosis palmaris et plantaris is another form of localized pustular psoriasis similar to acrodermatitis continua with pustules erupting from red tender scaly skin found on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet Generalized pustular psoriasis GPP is also known as von Zumbusch acute generalized pustular psoriasis in acute cases and as impetigo herpetiformis during pregnancy GPP is a rare and severe form of psoriasis that may require hospitalization This form of psoriasis is characterized by an acute onset of numerous pustules on top of tender red skin This skin eruption is often accompanied by a fever muscle aches nausea and an elevated white blood cell count Annular pustular psoriasis APP a rare form of GPP is the most common type seen during childhood APP tends to occur in women more frequently than in men and is usually less severe than other forms of generalized pustular psoriasis such as impetigo herpetiformis This form of psoriasis is characterized by ring shaped plaques with pustules around the edges and yellow crusting APP most often affects the torso neck arms and legs
Red eye swelling of the conjunctiva and watering of the eyes are symptoms common to all forms of conjunctivitis However the pupils should be normally reactive and the visual acuity normal Conjunctivitis is identified by inflammation of the conjunctiva manifested by irritation and redness Examination using a slit lamp biomicroscope may improve diagnostic accuracy Examination of the palpebral conjunctiva that overlying the inner aspects of the eyelids is usually more diagnostic than examination of the bulbal conjunctiva that overlying the sclera
Neuroferritinopathy has several distinguishing signs and symptoms These fall into two categories diagnostic findings and physically visible symptoms
Obsessive compulsive personality disorder OCPD is marked by an excessive obsession with rules lists schedules and order a need for perfectionism that interferes with efficiency and the ability to complete tasks a devotion to productivity that hinders interpersonal relationships and leisure time rigidity and zealousness on matters of morality and ethics an inability to delegate responsibilities or work to others restricted functioning in interpersonal relationships restricted expression of emotion and affect and a need for control over ones environment and self Some of OCPDs symptoms are persistent and stable whilst others are unstable The obsession with perfectionism reluctance to delegate tasks to others and rigidity and stubbornness are stable symptoms On the other hand the symptoms that were most likely to change over time were the miserly spending style and the excessive devotion to productivity This discrepancy in the stability of symptoms may lead to mixed results in terms of the course of the disorder with some studies showing a remission rate of 58 after a 12 month period whilst others suggesting that the symptoms are stable and may worsen with age
Patients with ELST may present clinically with progressive or fluctuating one sided sensorineural hearing loss which may mimick Ménières disease due to the development of tumor associated endolymphatic hydrops Patients may also experience tinnitus vertigo and loss of vestibular function ataxia Alternatively symptom onset may be sudden due to intralabyrinthine hemorrhage Patients may also present with other symptoms related to von Hippel Lindau syndrome in other anatomic sites which will result in imaging evaluation of the head
Typically all baby teeth will be present by the age of three As for all adult teeth they erupt between the ages 6 to 14 with the exception of the third molar also known as the wisdom teeth which normally erupt between 17 and 25 years of age If the tooth has yet to erupt by an appropriate age panoramic x rays are taken
Krukenberg tumors often come to the attention when they cause abdominal or pelvic pain bloating ascites or pain during sexual intercourse Krukenberg tumors can occasionally provoke a reaction of the ovarian stroma which leads to hormone production that results in vaginal bleeding a change in menstrual habits or hirsutism or occasionally virilization as a main symptom In rare cases the disease can manifest with hydronephrosis and hydroureter All these symptoms are non specific and can also arise with a range of problems other than cancer and a diagnosis can only be made following confirmatory investigations such as computed tomography CT scans laparotomy and or a biopsy of the ovary
The constriction of appendages by amniotic bands may result in Constriction rings around the digits arms and legs Swelling of the extremities distal to the point of constriction congenital lymphedema Amputation of digits arms and legs congenital amputation
Young males are most often affected though similar symptoms have been reported in females with excessive vaginal discharge or leucorrhea which is also considered a vital fluid In addition there are symptoms of fatigue and weakness Patients with Dhat condition most normally ascribe their semen misfortune secretion of semen in urine to reasons like inordinate masturbation sensual dreams and unreasonable sexual longing Nocturnal emission and secretion of semen in urine are considered to be the most widely recognized symptoms of semen misfortune Patients with Dhat condition frequently dread the result of semen misfortune and regularly have the conviction that it will lead to decrease in sexual performance The most widely recognized side effects in patients with Dhat condition are shortcoming of the body sluggishness low energy and low temperament Premature ejaculation and impotence are commonly seen Other somatic symptoms like weakness easy fatiguability palpitations insomnia low mood guilt and anxiety are often present Males sometimes report a subjective feeling that their penises have shortened These symptoms are usually associated with an anxious and dysphoric mood state Another sign of this syndrome is white discharge According to Ayurvedic an Indian medical system men who have experienced this have shown signs of anxiety issues This disease is a culture bound syndrome Semen loss is generally viewed as taboo and harmful It is also associated with a lower socioeconomic class Being able to produce semen is viewed as longevity of ones health and certain powers In Indian culture it is important for a man to produce semen
Its rupture can create sharp severe pain on the side of the ovary on which the cyst appears This sharp pain sometimes called mittelschmerz occurs in the middle of the menstrual cycle during ovulation About a fourth of women with this type of cyst experience pain Usually these cysts produce no symptoms and disappear by themselves within a few months
Signs and symptoms may vary and some individuals may not experience any symptoms at all The most common reported symptom of polioencephalitis is fatigue Fatigue is associated with difficulty in attention cognition and maintaining wakefulness Some individuals experience psychiatric symptoms that include anxious mood pain insomnia and depressed mood Confusion and disorientation of time and space have also been reported Motor symptoms vary more from patient to patient but can include incoordination and tremors nystagmus loss of conjugate eye movements rigidity and hemiparesis
Ataxia refers to a lack of coordinated muscle movements that include gait abnormality and is the cerebellar sign that typifies all spinocerebellar ataxia SCA types though individuals with SCA1 also develop pyramidal and bulbar signs as the disease progresses The average age of onset is between 30 and 40 years of age though exceptions exist From the first symptoms duration is typically between one and three decades where earlier onset correlates with faster progression Spinocerebellar ataxia 1 like other SCAs often causes dysarthria a motor disorder of speech often manifest as slurring of words pathological nystagmus a disorder in which eyes drift involuntarily affecting vision and gait and balance issues SCA1 is also commonly present with dysphagia a swallowing disorder that can cause choking while eating and drinking and hypermetric saccades where the eye tends to move faster or further than intended as it tracks an object or moves from one focus to another As the disease progresses more severe neurologic symptoms can appear like dysmetria where limb movements consistently overshoot the desired position dysdiadochokinesia where repeated body movements become uncoordinated or hypotonia where muscles atrophy While new symptoms appear as SCA1 progresses nystagmus may disappear as eye movements and saccades slow down Fatality may ultimately be caused by loss of bulbar functions but complications from symptoms such as pneumonia from swallowing problems or trauma from falls can be fatal as well The severity and exact phenotype of these symptoms may vary between types of SCA SCA 1 dysarthria may vary in severity depending on the task and is often associated with more strained strangled or harsh sounding vocalization than that of other disorders Because of the significant variance between cases of SCA1 typical signs and symptoms may appear alongside more subtle or rare symptoms Maculopathy has been reported in rare cases and may be linked effects from the mutation on the ATXN1 locus on genes in neighboring loci Task specific dystonias have been reported in individual cases often in the form of writers cramps or cervical dystonia SCAs can also be detected before serious atrophy with electrophysiologic techniques using electrodes on the scalp to detect changes in electric potential within the brain in response to sensations or movements Individuals with SCA1 often exhibit abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potential including prolonged latency and absent or poorly defined waveforms with one study reporting 73 3 of test subjects exhibiting abnormalities The same study also found abnormalities in visual evoked potential and median somatosensory evoked potential in some SCA1 persons These results were similar to those exhibited in other SCAs and differences between the SCAs were not statistically significant so electrophysiologic techniques cannot replace genetic testing for specific diagnoses of SCAs All SCAs cause atrophy in various neural tissues that are detectable using magnetic resonance imaging computed tomography or other imaging techniques In SCA1 some degradation in the grey matter of the cerebellum and brain stem can sometimes be detected in presymptomatic individuals with the expansion in ATXN1 Typically grey matter loss can be observed in cerebellar vermis in all lobules of the cerebellum and in the paramedian portions of both hemispheres White matter loss can also be observed in the middle cerebellar peduncles The volume loss can be correlated to severity and duration An estimated 77 of cases of progressive cerebellar disease are reported to have one or more mental health disorders and 19 exhibit cognitive disorders These estimates are consistently higher than the portion with mental health disorders in the general population but still follow other general patterns like correlations between depression frequency and sex or age It is unclear if depression can be linked causally to cerebellar degeneration one study reports data consistent with depression primarily being a response to the disability not a symptom of it while another reports evidence that depression may have a causal link prevalence of depression varies differently between SCA types than does the rate of progression of disability
Signs of GPS typically arise at birth or in childhood these signs and symptoms include thrombocytopenia bruising susceptibility and epistaxis Typically the observed low platelet count in individuals is progressive this can result in fatal hemorrhages later in life Additionally females who are affected may experience irregular menstrual cycles and heavy menstrual bleeding Another common effect of GPS is myelofibrosis where scar tissue builds up in the bone marrow causing it to be unable to produce a sufficient amount of blood cells To compensate other organs such as the spleen start to produce more blood cells which can lead to splenomegaly
Some symptoms and signs of Bagassosis include breathlessness cough haemoptysis slight fever Acute diffuse bronchiolitis may also occur An xray may show mottling of lungs or a shadow
Child Severe prenatal deficiency of GH as occurs in congenital hypopituitarism has little effect on fetal growth However prenatal and congenital deficiency can reduce the size of a males penis especially when gonadotropins are also deficient Besides micropenis in males additional consequences of severe deficiency in the first days of life can include hypoglycemia and exaggerated jaundice both direct and indirect hyper bili rubi nemia Even congenital GH deficiency does not usually impair length growth until after the first few months of life From late in the first year until mid teens poor growth and or shortness is the hallmark of childhood GH deficiency Growth is not as severely affected in GH deficiency as in untreated hypothyroidism but growth at about half the usual velocity for age is typical It tends to be accompanied by delayed physical maturation so that bone maturation and puberty may be several years delayed When severe GH deficiency is present from birth and never treated adult heights can be as short as 48 65 inches 122 165 cm Severe GH deficiency in early childhood also results in slower muscular development so that gross motor milestones such as standing walking and jumping may be delayed Body composition i e the relative amounts of bone muscle and fat is affected in many children with severe deficiency so that mild to moderate chubbiness is common though GH deficiency alone rarely causes severe obesity Some severely GH deficient children have recognizable cherubic facial features characterized by maxillary hypoplasia and forehead prominence Other side effects in children include sparse hair growth and frontal recession and pili torti and trichorrhexis nodosa are also sometimes present 501
Patients are normal at birth and the syndrome manifests during childhood and puberty The enchondromas affect the extremities and their distribution is asymmetrical The most common sites of enchondromas are the metacarpal bones and phalanges of the hands The feet are less commonly affected Disfigurations of the extremities are a result Pathological fractures can arise in affected metaphyses and diaphyses of the long bones and are common 26 The risk for sarcomatous degeneration of enchondromas hemangiomas or lymphangiomas is 15 30 in the setting of Maffucci syndrome Maffucci syndrome is associated with a higher risk of CNS pancreatic and ovarian malignancies Multiple enchondromas may present in three disorders Ollier disease Maffucci syndrome and metachondromatosis It is important to make the distinction between these diseases particularly Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome Ollier disease is more common than Maffucci syndrome and presents with multiple enchondromas often in a unilateral distribution However hemangiomas and lymphangiomas are not seen in Ollier disease Metachondromatosis demonstrates autosomal dominant transmission and presents with both multiple osteochondromas and enchondromas It is associated with multiple cavernous hemangioma and phlebolith Lymphangiomas may also be apparent
The initial lesion is a small swelling under the skin following minor trauma It appears as a painless wet nodule which may be present for years before ulceration swelling and weeping from sinuses followed by bone deformity The sinuses discharge a grainy liquid of fungal colonies These grains are usually black or white Destruction of deeper tissues and deformity and loss of function in the affected limbs may occur in later stages It tends to occur in one foot Mycetoma due to bacteria has similar clinical features
People diagnosed with HPD may be dramatic They often fail to see their own personal situation realistically instead dramatizing and exaggerating their difficulties Patients with this disorder can have rapidly shifting emotions and a decreased ability to recognize others emotions Their emotions may appear superficial or exaggerated to others This disorder is associated with extraversion a lower tolerance for frustration or delayed gratification and openness to new experiences People with HPD may have little self doubt and often appear egocentric Research has also shown those with histrionic personality have a greater desire for social approval and reassurance and will constantly seek it out making those with HPD more vulnerable to social media addiction People with this disorder often display excessive sensitivity to criticism or disapproval They will work hard to get others to pay attention to them possibly as a method of testing the stability of relationships They may enjoy situations in which they can be the center of attention and may feel uncomfortable when people are not paying attention to them It is common for people with this disorder to wear flamboyant clothing try body modifications and fake medical conditions in an attempt to draw others attention They may display inappropriately sexually provocative flirtatious or exploitative behavior Sexting and exhibitionist behavior are also behaviors people with this condition sometimes exhibit Some people with histrionic traits or personality disorder change their seduction technique into a more maternal or paternal style as they age When their desire for attention is not met it can heighten the severity of their symptoms They tend to be impressionable and easily manipulatable especially by those they respect Patients with HPD are usually high functioning both socially and professionally They usually have good social skills despite tending to use them to make themselves the center of attention HPD may also affect a persons social and romantic relationships as well as their ability to cope with losses or failures People with HPD tend to consider relationships closer than they usually are They may seek treatment for clinical depression when romantic or other close personal relationships end Substance disorders such as Alcohol Use Disorder or Opioid use disorder are all common in patients with Histrionic Personality Disorder They are also at higher risks of suicide body dysmorphia and divorce They may go through frequent job changes as they become easily bored and may prefer withdrawing from frustration instead of facing it Because they tend to crave novelty and excitement they may place themselves in risky situations All of these factors may lead to greater risk of developing clinical depression People with this condition can have an impressionistic and undetailed style of speech Despite these traits they can be prideful of their own personality and may be unwilling to change viewing any change as a threat They may even blame their personal failures or disappointments on others
Although bone tissue contains no pain receptors a bone fracture is painful for several reasons Breaking in the continuity of the periosteum with or without similar discontinuity in endosteum as both contain multiple pain receptors Edema and hematoma of nearby soft tissues caused by ruptured bone marrow evokes pressure pain Involuntary muscle spasms trying to hold bone fragments in place Damage to adjacent structures such as nerves muscles or blood vessels spinal cord and nerve roots for spine fractures or cranial contents for skull fractures may cause other specific signs and symptoms
Symptoms include catching or locking of the involved finger when it is forcefully flexed There may be tenderness in the palm of the hand near the last skin crease distal palmar crease Often a nodule can be felt in this area There is some evidence that idiopathic trigger finger behaves differently in people with diabetes
The clinical phenotypes of CMAMMA are highly heterogeneous and range from asymptomatic mild to severe symptoms The underlying pathophysiology is not yet understood The following symptoms are reported in the literature
Adult polyglucosan body disease is a condition that affects the nervous system People with this condition have problems walking due to reduced sensation in their legs peripheral neuropathy and progressive muscle weakness and stiffness spasticity Damage to the nerves that control bladder function neurogenic bladder causes progressive difficulty in controlling the flow of urine About half of people with adult polyglucosan body disease experience dementia Most people with the condition first complain of bladder issues People with adult polyglucosan body disease typically first experience signs and symptoms related to the condition between ages 30 and 60
The symptoms usually appear after a menstrual period The most common are an abnormal smell and colour of vaginal discharge fever nausea vomiting bloating and frequent urination Pain may be felt during ovulation during periods during sexual intercourse on both sides of the abdomen and lower back
Onset is usually confined to infancy and early childhood with peak prevalence at 18 36 months In rare cases particularly where the child is severely mentally impaired onset may extend to adolescence The classical symptoms of the syndrome are spasmodic torticollis and dystonia Nodding and rotation of the head neck extension gurgling writhing movements of the limbs and severe hypotonia have also been noted Spasms may last for 1 3 minutes and may occur up to 10 times a day Ingestion of food is often associated with occurrence of symptoms this may result in reluctance to feed Associated symptoms such as epigastric discomfort vomiting which may involve blood and abnormal eye movements have been reported Clinical signs may also include anaemia
A common symptom of paranoia is the attribution bias These individuals typically have a biased perception of reality often exhibiting more hostile beliefs A paranoid person may view someone elses accidental behavior as though it is with intent or threatening An investigation of a non clinical paranoid population found that feeling powerless and depressed isolating oneself and relinquishing activities are characteristics that could be associated with those exhibiting more frequent paranoia Some scientists have created different subtypes for the various symptoms of paranoia including erotic persecutory litigious and exalted Due to the suspicious and troublesome personality traits of paranoia it is unlikely that someone with paranoia will thrive in interpersonal relationships Most commonly paranoid individuals tend to be of a single status According to some research there is a hierarchy for paranoia The least common types of paranoia at the very top of the hierarchy would be those involving more serious threats Social anxiety is at the bottom of this hierarchy as the most frequently exhibited level of paranoia
General By far the two most common symptoms described are pain and the feeling that teeth no longer correctly meet traumatic malocclusion or disocclusion The teeth are very sensitive to pressure proprioception so even a small change in the location of the teeth will generate this sensation People will also be very sensitive to touching the area of the jaw that is broken or in the case of condylar fracture the area just in front of the tragus of the ear Other symptoms may include loose teeth teeth on either side of the fracture will feel loose because the fracture is mobile numbness because the inferior alveolar nerve runs along the jaw and can be compressed by a fracture and trismus difficulty opening the mouth Outside the mouth signs of swelling bruising and deformity can all be seen Condylar fractures are deep so it is rare to see significant swelling although the trauma can cause fracture of the bone on the anterior aspect of the external auditory meatus so bruising or bleeding can sometimes be seen in the ear canal Mouth opening can be diminished less than 3 cm There can be numbness or altered sensation anesthesia paraesthesia in the chin and lower lip the distribution of the mental nerve Intraorally if the fracture occurs in the tooth bearing area a step may seen between the teeth on either side of the fracture or a space can be seen often mistaken for a lost tooth and bleeding from the gingiva in the area There can be an open bite where the lower teeth no longer meet the upper teeth In the case of a unilateral condylar fracture the back teeth on the side of the fracture will meet and the open bite will get progressively greater towards the other side of the mouth Sometimes bruising will develop in the floor of the mouth sublingual eccymosis and the fracture can be moved by moving either side of the fracture segment up and down For fractures that occur in the non tooth bearing area condyle ramus and sometimes the angle an open bite is an important clinical feature since little else other than swelling may be apparent page number needed
The signs and symptoms of tubo ovarian abscess TOA are the same as with pelvic inflammatory disease PID with the exception that the abscess can be found with magnetic resonance imaging MRI sonography and x ray It also differs from PID in that it can create symptoms of acute onset pelvic pain Typically this disease is found in sexually active women Tubo ovarian abscess can mimic abdominal tumours
Acute Acute exposure to cadmium fumes may cause flu like symptoms including chills fever and muscle ache sometimes referred to as the cadmium blues Symptoms may resolve after a week if there is no respiratory damage More severe exposures can cause tracheobronchitis pneumonitis and pulmonary edema Symptoms of inflammation may start hours after the exposure and include cough dryness and irritation of the nose and throat headache dizziness weakness fever chills and chest pain
Infantile acne has a later onset and is less commonly seen than neonatal acne occurring between 6 weeks to 1 year of age It is also more commonly seen in boys rather than girls Infantile acne tends to be more inflammatory and wide spread than neonatal acne It presents with both open and closed comedones papules and pustules Cystic lesions are uncommon Scarring can occur in severe cases Very rarely facial conglobate acne a severe form of acne that involves extensive inflammation and nodule formation can develop and lead to extensive scarring Lesions occur most commonly on the cheeks but can also appear on the chest and back More severe occurrences may lead to development of more severe forms of acne in adolescence
Queensland tick typhus is a tick borne disease Onset of the illness is variable there is an incubation period of 2 to 14 days after being bitten by the infected tick The clinical features of this illness include fever headache an eschar at the site of the tick bite erythematous eruption and satellite lymphadenopathy Queensland tick typhus symptomatically resembles Rocky Mountain spotted fever a less severe tick borne disease If left untreated for longer than one to two weeks the disease can take longer to recover from and pose a heightened risk of pneumonitis encephalitis septic shock or even death In some cases even after the initial rash is cleared the person may still experience prolonged lethargy or fatigue which is common in such rickettsial infections
Symptoms usually present from the period of birth to early childhood as nose bleeds bruising and or gum bleeding Problems later in life may arise from anything that can cause internal bleeding such as stomach ulcers surgery trauma or menstruation Abnormality of the abdomen nosebleeds heavy menstrual bleeding purpura too few platelets circulating in the blood and prolonged bleeding time have also been listed as symptoms of various giant platelet disorders
Tetrasomy 18p causes a wide range of medical and developmental problems
The clinical presentation of hydrocephalus varies with chronicity Acute dilatation of the ventricular system is more likely to manifest with the nonspecific signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure ICP By contrast chronic dilatation especially in the elderly population may have a more insidious onset presenting for instance with Hakims triad Adams triad Symptoms of increased ICP may include headaches vomiting nausea papilledema sleepiness or coma With increased levels of CSF there have been cases of hearing loss due to CSF creating pressure on the auditory pathways or disrupting the communication of inner ear fluid Elevated ICP of different etiologies have been linked to sensorineural hearing loss SNHL Transient SNHL has been reported after the loss of CSF with shunt surgeries Hearing loss is a rare but well known sequela of procedures resulting in CSF loss Elevated ICP may result in uncal or tonsillar herniation with resulting life threatening brain stem compression Hakims triad of gait instability urinary incontinence and dementia is a relatively typical manifestation of the distinct entity normal pressure hydrocephalus Focal neurological deficits may also occur such as abducens nerve palsy and vertical gaze palsy Parinaud syndrome due to compression of the quadrigeminal plate where the neural centers coordinating the conjugated vertical eye movement are located The symptoms depend on the cause of the blockage the persons age and how much brain tissue has been damaged by the swelling In infants with hydrocephalus CSF builds up in the central nervous system CNS causing the fontanelle soft spot to bulge and the head to be larger than expected Early symptoms may also include Eyes that appear to gaze downward Irritability Seizures Separated sutures Sleepiness VomitingSymptoms that may occur in older children can include Brief shrill high pitched cry Changes in personality memory or the ability to reason or think Changes in facial appearance and eye spacing craniofacial disproportion Crossed eyes or uncontrolled eye movements Difficulty feeding Excessive sleepiness Headaches Irritability poor temper control Loss of bladder control urinary incontinence Loss of coordination and trouble walking Muscle spasticity spasm Slow growth child 0 5 years Delayed milestones Failure to thrive Slow or restricted movement VomitingBecause hydrocephalus can injure the brain thought and behavior may be adversely affected Learning disabilities including short term memory loss are common among those with hydrocephalus who tend to score better on verbal IQ than on performance IQ which is thought to reflect the distribution of nerve damage to the brain Hydrocephalus that is present from birth can cause long term complications with speech and language Children can have issues such as nonverbal learning disorder difficulty understanding complex and abstract concepts difficulty retrieving stored information and spatial perceptual disorders Children with hydrocephalus are often known in having the difficulty in understanding the concepts within conversation and tend to use words they know or have heard However the severity of hydrocephalus can differ considerably between individuals and some are of average or above average intelligence Someone with hydrocephalus may have coordination and visual problems or clumsiness They may reach puberty earlier than the average child this is called precocious puberty About one in four develops epilepsy
New or progressive infiltrate on the chest X ray with one of the following Fever 37 8 C 100 F Purulent sputum Leukocytosis 10 000 cells μlIn an elderly person the first sign of hospital acquired pneumonia may be mental changes or confusion Other symptoms may include
In a healthy person during sleep breathing is regular so oxygen levels and carbon dioxide levels in the bloodstream stay fairly constant After exhalation the blood level of oxygen decreases and that of carbon dioxide increases Exchange of gases with a lungful of fresh air is necessary to replenish oxygen and rid the bloodstream of built up carbon dioxide Oxygen and carbon dioxide receptors in the body called chemoreceptors send nerve impulses to the brain which then signals for reflexive opening of the larynx enlarging the opening between the vocal cords and movements of the rib cage muscles and diaphragm These muscles expand the thorax chest cavity so that a partial vacuum is made within the lungs and air rushes in to fill it In the absence of central apnea any sudden drop in oxygen or excess of carbon dioxide even if small strongly stimulates the brains respiratory centers to breathe the respiratory drive is so strong that even conscious efforts to hold ones breath do not overcome it In pure central sleep apnea the brains respiratory control centers located in the region of the human brain known as the pre Botzinger complex are imbalanced during sleep and fail to give the signal to inhale causing the individual to miss one or more cycles of breathing The neurological feedback mechanism that monitors blood levels of carbon dioxide and in turn stimulates respiration fails to react quickly enough to maintain an even respiratory rate allowing the entire respiratory system to cycle between apnea and hyperpnea even for a brief time following an awakening during a breathing pause The sleeper stops breathing for up to two minutes and then starts again There is no effort made to breathe during the pause in breathing there are no chest movements and no muscular struggling although when awakening occurs in the middle of a pause the inability to immediately operate the breathing muscles often results in cognitive struggle accompanied by a feeling of panic exacerbated by the feeling associated with excessive blood CO2 levels Even in severe cases of central sleep apnea however the effects almost always result in pauses that make breathing irregular rather than cause the total cessation of breathing over the medium term After the episode of apnea breathing may be faster and or more intense hyperpnea for a period of time a compensatory mechanism to blow off retained waste gases absorb more oxygen and when voluntary enable a return to normal instinctive breathing patterns by restoring oxygen to the breathing muscles themselves
FA is characterized by bone marrow failure AML solid tumors and developmental abnormalities Classic features include abnormal thumbs absent radii short stature skin hyperpigmentation including café au lait spots abnormal facial features triangular face microcephaly abnormal kidneys and decreased fertility Many FA patients about 30 do not have any of the classic physical findings but diepoxybutane chromosome fragility assay showing increased chromosomal breaks can make the diagnosis About 80 of FA will develop bone marrow failure by age 20 The first sign of a hematologic problem is usually petechiae and bruises with later onset of pale appearance feeling tired and infections Because macrocytosis usually precedes a low platelet count patients with typical congenital anomalies associated with FA should be evaluated for an elevated red blood cell mean corpuscular volume
Grovers disease often starts quite suddenly There are intensely itchy spots on the central back mid chest and occasionally elsewhere Frequently it follows sweating or some unexpected heat stress The itchy eruption lasts an average of 10 12 months It is characterized by papules and papulovesicles with excoriations occurring on the chest back lower sternum arms and thighs The papules are most commonly found on the mid chest Sometimes the features of Grovers are found in people who do not itch or have a conspicuous rash Most of the people with Grovers who visit a dermatologist however itch a lot
Symptoms of radial neuropathy vary depending on the severity of the trauma however common symptoms may include wrist drop numbness on the back of the hand and wrist and inability to voluntarily straighten the fingers Loss of wrist extension is due to loss of the ability to move of the posterior compartment of forearm muscles In the event of lacerations to the wrist area the symptom would therefore be sensory Additionally depending on the type of trauma other nerves may be affected such as the median nerve and axillary nerves
The classical triad of symptoms that defines 3C syndrome includes certain heart defects hypoplasia underdevelopment of the cerebellum and cranial dysmorphisms which can take various forms The heart defects and cranial dysmorphisms are heterogeneous in individuals who are all classed as having Ritscher Schinzel syndrome Heart defects commonly seen with Ritscher Schinzel syndrome are associated with the endocardial cushion and are the most important factor in determining a diagnosis The mitral valve and tricuspid valve of the heart can be malformed the atrioventricular canal can be complete instead of developing into the interatrial septum and interventricular septum and conotruncal heart defects which include tetralogy of Fallot double outlet right ventricle transposition of the great vessels and hypoplastic left heart syndrome Aortic stenosis and pulmonary stenosis have also been associated with 3C syndrome The cranial dysmorphisms associated with 3C syndrome are heterogeneous and include a degree of macrocephaly a large anterior fontanel a particularly prominent occiput and forehead ocular hypertelorism wide set eyes slanted palpebral fissures cleft palate a depressed nasal bridge cleft palate with associated bifid uvula low set ears micrognathia an abnormally small jaw brachycephaly flattened head and ocular coloboma Low set ears are the most common cranial dysmorphism seen in 3C syndrome and ocular coloboma is the least common of the non concurrent symptoms cleft lip co occurring with cleft palate is the least common Cranial dysplasias associated with 3C syndrome are also reflected in the brain Besides the cerebellar hypoplasia cysts are commonly found in the posterior cranial fossa the ventricles and the cisterna magna are dilated enlarged and Dandy Walker malformation is present These are reflected in the developmental delays typical of the disease 75 of children with 3C syndrome have Dandy Walker malformation and hydrocephalus Signs and symptoms in other body systems are also associated with 3C syndrome In the skeletal system ribs may be absent and hemivertebrae syndactyly fusion of fingers together and clinodactyly curvature of the fifth finger may be present In the GI and genitourinary systems anal atresia hypospadia misplaced urethra and hydronephrosis may exist Adrenal hypoplasia and growth hormone deficiency are associated endocrine consequences of Ritscher Schinzel syndrome Some immunodeficiency has also been reported in connection with 3C syndrome Many children with the disorder die as infants due to severe congenital heart disease The proband of Ritscher and Schinzels original study was still alive at the age of 21 A fetus with 3C syndrome may have an umbilical cord with one umbilical artery instead of two
The onset is gradual and uniform The pathological findings of subacute combined degeneration consist of patchy losses of myelin in the dorsal and lateral columns Patients present with weakness of the legs arms and trunk and tingling and numbness that progressively worsens Vision changes and change of mental state may also be present Bilateral spastic paresis may develop and pressure vibration and touch sense are diminished A positive Babinski sign may be seen Prolonged deficiency of vitamin B12 leads to irreversible nervous system damage HIV associated vacuolar myelopathy can present with a similar pattern of dorsal column and corticospinal tract demyelination It has been thought that if someone is deficient in vitamin B12 and folic acid the vitamin B12 deficiency must be treated first However the basis for this has been challenged although due to ethical considerations it is no longer able to be tested if neuropathy is made more severe as a result of giving folic acid to vitamin B12 deficient individuals And that if this were the case then the mechanism remains unclear Administration of nitrous oxide anesthesia can precipitate subacute combined degeneration in people with subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency while chronic nitrous oxide exposure can cause it even in persons with normal B12 levels Posterior column dysfunction decreases vibratory sensation and proprioception joint sense Lateral corticospinal tract dysfunction produces spasticity and dorsal spinocerebellar tract dysfunction causes ataxia
Individuals with KSS present initially in a similar way to those with typical CPEO Onset is in the first and second decades of life The first symptom of this disease is a unilateral ptosis or difficulty opening the eyelids that gradually progresses to a bilateral ptosis As the ptosis worsens the individual commonly extends their neck elevating their chin in an attempt to prevent the eyelids from occluding the visual axis Along with the insidious development of ptosis eye movements eventually become limited causing a person to rely more on turning the head side to side or up and down to view objects in the peripheral visual field
SLOS can present itself differently in different cases depending on the severity of the mutation and other factors Originally SLOS patients were classified into two categories classic and severe based on physical and mental characteristics alongside other clinical features Since the discovery of the specific biochemical defect responsible for SLOS patients are given a severity score based on their levels of cerebral ocular oral and genital defects It is then used to classify patients as having mild classical or severe SLOS
The nasal septum is the bone and cartilage in the nose that separates the nasal cavity into the two nostrils The cartilage is called the quadrangular cartilage and the bones comprising the septum include the maxillary crest vomer and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid Normally the septum lies centrally and thus the nasal passages are symmetrical A deviated septum is an abnormal condition in which the top of the cartilaginous ridge leans to the left or the right causing obstruction of the affected nasal passage It is common for nasal septa to depart from the exact centerline the septum is only considered deviated if the shift is substantial or causes problems By itself a deviated septum can go undetected for years and thus be without any need for correction Symptoms of a deviated septum include infections of the sinus and sleep apnea snoring repetitive sneezing facial pain nosebleeds mouth breathing difficulty with breathing and mild to severe loss of the ability to smell Only more severe cases of a deviated septum will cause symptoms of difficulty breathing and require treatment
The typical signs of post pericardiotomy syndrome include fever pleuritis with possible pleural effusion pericarditis with possible pericardial effusion occasional but rare pulmonary infiltrates and fatigue Cough pleuritic or retrosternal chest pain joint pain and decreased oxygen saturation can also be seen in some cases Other signs include arthritis together with petechiae on the skin and palate 827
Sun sensitive rash with prominent poikiloderma and telangiectasias Juvenile cataracts Saddle nose Congenital bone defects including short stature and radial ray anomalies such as absent thumbs Hair growth problems absent eyelashes eyebrows and or hair Hypogonadism has not been well documented Hypodontia Calcium problems not documented in journals Ear problems not documented in journals but identified by patients in support groups Produces osteosarcomaThe skin is normal at birth Between 3 and 6 months of age the affected carrier develops poikiloderma on the cheeks This characteristic rash that all RTS carriers have can develop on the arms legs and buttocks Poikiloderma consists of areas of increased and decreased pigmentation prominent blood vessels and thinning of the skin
Patients with cerebellar degeneration experience a progressive loss of nerve cells Purkinje cells throughout the cerebellum As well as this it is common to incur an elevated blood protein level and a high volume of lymph cells within the cerebrospinal fluid resulting in swelling and enlargement of the brain The most characteristic signs and symptoms experienced by patients with cerebellar degeneration include muscle weakness an uncoordinated staggering walk quivering of the torso jerky arm and leg movements tendency to falling over dysarthria difficulty in articulating speech dysphagia difficulty in deglutition swallowing of solids and liquids vertigo dizziness nystagmus rapid involuntary eye movements causing sleep disturbances ophthalmoplegia paralysis of extraocular muscles diplopia double vision Scientific studies have revealed that psychiatric symptoms are also common in patients with cerebellar degeneration where dementia is a typical psychiatric disorder resulting from cerebellar damage Approximately 50 of all patients experience dementia as a result of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration
Pain can either be relegated to a specific part of the body or spread to the entire body It is typically constant and may be moderate to severe in intensity Those who are afflicted describe it as being stuck in a loop of pain It is often made worse by touch movement emotions barometric pressure and temperature changes usually cold temperatures along with many other similar triggers Cold temperatures regularly make the burning pain worse in certain body parts Burning pain is the most common sensation but patients also report pins and needles pressing lacerating aching and extreme bursts or constant sharp or unremitting excruciating pain Individuals may have reduced sensitivity to touch in the areas affected by the pain as if the part is falling asleep The burning and loss of sense of touch are usually but not always most severe on the distant parts of the body such as the feet or hands spreading until it is in some cases felt from head to toe Usually the burning pain in body parts is a result of old injuries that seem like they should have healed long ago yet the pain lingers on and even years afterwards For some patients with intense affliction there often can be unremitting nausea causing vomiting The pain can also bring on hyperventilation Blood pressure can rise due to the pain
Like many other genetic disorders that affect lipid metabolism there are several forms of MLD which are late infantile juvenile and adult In the late infantile form which is the most common form of MLD 50 60 affected children begin having difficulty walking after the first year of life usually at 15 24 months Symptoms include muscle wasting and weakness muscle rigidity developmental delays progressive loss of vision leading to blindness convulsions impaired swallowing paralysis and dementia Children may become comatose Untreated most children with this form of MLD die by age 5 often much sooner Children with the juvenile form of MLD onset between 3 and 10 years of age usually begin with impaired school performance mental deterioration and dementia then develop symptoms similar to the late infantile form but with slower progression Age of death is variable but normally within 10 to 15 years of symptom onset Some patients can live for several decades after onset A recent trend is to try to distinguish early juvenile ages 3 7 and late juvenile forms of the disease Generally early juveniles have motor skill declines as their first symptoms while late juveniles show cognitive declines first The adult form commonly begins after age 16 often with an onset in the 4th or 5th decade of life and presents as a psychiatric disorder or progressive dementia Adult onset MLD usually progresses more slowly than the late infantile and juvenile forms with a protracted course of a decade or more Palliative care can help with many of the symptoms and usually improves quality of life and longevity Carriers have low enzyme levels compared to their family population normal levels vary from family to family but even low enzyme levels are adequate to process the bodys sulfatide
Adults with encephalitis present with acute onset of fever headache confusion and sometimes seizures Younger children or infants may present with irritability poor appetite and fever Neurological examinations usually reveal a drowsy or confused person Stiff neck due to the irritation of the meninges covering the brain indicates that the patient has either meningitis or meningoencephalitis
Patients with pancreatic abscesses may experience abdominal pain chills and fever or the inability to eat Whereas some patients present an abdominal mass others do not Nausea and vomiting may also occur
Those with tonsillitis usually experience sore throat painful swallowing malaise and fever Their tonsils and often the back of the throat appear red and swollen and sometimes give off a white discharge Some also have tender swelling of the cervical lymph nodes Many viral infections that cause tonsillitis will also cause cough runny nose hoarse voice or blistering in the mouth or throat Infectious mononucleosis can cause the tonsils to swell with red spots or white discharge that may extend to the tongue This can be accompanied by fever sore throat cervical lymph node swelling and enlargement of the liver and spleen Bacterial infections that cause tonsillitis can also cause a distinct scarletiniform rash vomiting and tonsillar spots or discharge Tonsilloliths occur in up to 10 of the population frequently due to episodes of tonsillitis
Dravet syndrome has been characterized by prolonged febrile and non febrile seizures within the first year of a childs life This disease progresses to other seizure types like myoclonic and partial seizures psychomotor delay and ataxia It is characterized by cognitive impairment behavioural disorders and motor deficits Behavioural deficits often include hyperactivity and impulsiveness and in more rare cases autistic like behaviours Dravet syndrome is also associated with sleep disorders including somnolence and insomnia The seizures experienced by people with Dravet syndrome become worse as the patient ages as the disease is not very observable when symptoms first appear This coupled with the range of severity differing between each individual diagnosed and the resistance of these seizures to drugs has made it challenging to develop treatments Dravet syndrome appears during the first year of life often beginning around six months of age with frequent febrile seizures fever related seizures Children with Dravet syndrome typically experience a lagged development of language and motor skills hyperactivity and sleep difficulties chronic infection growth and balance issues and difficulty relating to others The effects of this disorder do not diminish over time and children diagnosed with Dravet syndrome require fully committed caretakers with tremendous patience and the ability to closely monitor them Febrile seizures are divided into two categories known as simple and complex A febrile seizure would be categorized as complex if it has occurred within 24 hours of another seizure or if it lasts longer than 15 minutes A febrile seizure lasting less than 15 minutes would be considered simple Sometimes modest hyperthermic stressors like physical exertion or a hot bath can provoke seizures in affected individuals However any seizure uninterrupted after 5 minutes without a resumption of postictal more normal recovery type after seizure consciousness can lead to potentially fatal status epilepticus
The hallmark signs and symptoms of Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease include little or no movement in the arms or legs respiratory difficulties and characteristic horizontal movements of the eyes left to right The onset of Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease is usually in early infancy The most characteristic early signs are nystagmus rapid involuntary rhythmic motion of the eyes and low muscle tone Motor abilities are delayed or never acquired mostly depending upon the severity of the mutation Most children with Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease learn to understand language and usually have some speech Other signs may include tremor lack of coordination involuntary movements weakness unsteady gait and over time spasticity in legs and arms Muscle contractures often occur over time Mental functions may deteriorate Some patients may have convulsions and skeletal deformation such as scoliosis resulting from abnormal muscular stress on bones
Gastric varices can present in two major ways First patients with cirrhosis may be enrolled in screening gastroscopy programs to detect esophageal varices These evaluations may detect gastric varices that are asymptomatic When gastric varices are symptomatic however they usually present acutely and dramatically with upper gastrointestinal bleeding The symptoms can include vomiting blood melena passing black tarry stools or passing maroon stools or frank blood in the stools Many people with bleeding gastric varices present in shock due to the profound loss of blood Secondly patients with acute pancreatitis may present with gastric varices as a complication of a blood clot in the splenic vein The splenic vein sits over the pancreas anatomically and inflammation or cancers of the pancreas may result in a blood clot forming in the splenic vein As the short gastric veins of the fundus of the stomach drain into the splenic vein thrombosis of the splenic vein will result in increased pressure and engorgement of the short veins leading to varices in the fundus of the stomach Laboratory testing usually shows low red blood cell count and often a low platelet count If cirrhosis is present there may be coagulopathy manifested by a prolonged INR both of these may worsen the bleeding from gastric varices In very rare cases gastric varices are caused by splenic vein occlusion as a result of the mass effect of slow growing pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
People with significant vision loss may have vivid recurrent visual hallucinations fictive visual percepts One characteristic of these hallucinations is that they usually are lilliputian hallucinations in which the characters or objects are smaller than normal Depending on the content visual hallucinations can be classified as either simple or complex Simple visual hallucinations are commonly characterized by shapes photopsias and grid like patterns Complex visual hallucinations consist of highly detailed representations of people and objects The most common hallucination is of faces or cartoons Sufferers understand that the hallucinations are not real and the hallucinations are only visual that is they do not occur in any other senses such as hearing smell or taste Visual hallucinations generally appear when the eyes are open fading once the visual gaze shifts It is widely claimed that sensory deprivation is instrumental in the progression of CBS During episodes of inactivity hallucinations are more likely to occur The majority of those suffering from CBS describe the duration of hallucinations to continue for up to a few minutes multiple times a day or week Even though people of all ages may be afflicted by Charles Bonnet syndrome those within the age range of 70 to 80 are primarily affected Among older adults 65 years with significant vision loss the prevalence of Charles Bonnet syndrome has been reported to be between 10 and 40 a 2008 Australian study found the prevalence to be 17 5 Two Asian studies however report a much lower prevalence The high incidence of underreporting this disorder is the greatest hindrance to determining the exact prevalence Underreporting is thought to be a result of sufferers being afraid to discuss the symptoms out of fear that they will be labeled of unsound mind
The condition commonly occurs in patients in their 40s and 50s predominantly in men Epiploic appendagitis is normally misdiagnosed in most patients Epiploic appendagitis presents with an acute onset of pain commonly in the left lower quadrant the symptoms often lead to a misdiagnosis for diverticulitis Diverticulitis manifests with evenly distributed lower abdominal pain accompanied with nausea fever and leukocytosis Patients with acute epiploic appendagitis do not normally report a change in bowel habits while a small number may have constipation or diarrhea
Pain swelling or stiffness in one or more joints is commonly present in psoriatic arthritis Psoriatic arthritis is inflammatory and affected joints are generally red or warm to the touch Asymmetrical oligoarthritis defined as inflammation affecting two to four joints during the first six months of disease is present in 70 of cases However in 15 of cases the arthritis is symmetrical The joints of the hand that is involved in psoriasis are the proximal interphalangeal PIP the distal interphalangeal DIP the metacarpophalangeal MCP and the wrist Involvement of the distal interphalangeal joints DIP is a characteristic feature and is present in 15 of cases In addition to affecting the joints of the hands and wrists psoriatic arthritis may affect the fingers nails and skin Sausage like swelling in the fingers or toes known as dactylitis may occur Psoriasis can also cause changes to the nails such as pitting or separation from the nail bed onycholysis hyperkeratosis under the nails and horizontal ridging Psoriasis classically presents with scaly skin lesions which are most commonly seen over extensor surfaces such as the scalp natal cleft and umbilicus In psoriatic arthritis pain can occur in the area of the sacrum the lower back above the tailbone as a result of sacroiliitis or spondylitis which is present in 40 of cases Pain can occur in and around the feet and ankles especially enthesitis in the Achilles tendon inflammation of the Achilles tendon where it inserts into the bone or plantar fasciitis in the sole of the foot Along with the above noted pain and inflammation there is extreme exhaustion that does not go away with adequate rest The exhaustion may last for days or weeks without abatement Psoriatic arthritis may remain mild or may progress to more destructive joint disease Periods of active disease or flares will typically alternate with periods of remission In severe forms psoriatic arthritis may progress to arthritis mutilans which on X ray gives a pencil in cup appearance Because prolonged inflammation can lead to joint damage early diagnosis and treatment to slow or prevent joint damage is recommended
Affected newborns may present with acute urinary retention In adolescent females the most common symptoms of an imperforate hymen are cyclic pelvic pain and amenorrhea other symptoms associated with hematocolpos include urinary retention constipation low back pain nausea and diarrhea Other vaginal anomalies can have similar symptoms to an imperforate hymen Vaginal atresia and a transverse vaginal septum require differentiation A strong urge to defecate has been observed in a few women
Thrombocytopenia usually has no symptoms and is picked up on a routine complete blood count Some individuals with thrombocytopenia may experience external bleeding such as nosebleeds or bleeding gums Some women may have heavier or longer periods or breakthrough bleeding Bruising particularly purpura in the forearms and petechiae in the feet legs and mucous membranes may be caused by spontaneous bleeding under the skin Eliciting a full medical history is vital to ensure the low platelet count is not secondary to another disorder Ensuring that the other blood cell types such as red blood cells and white blood cells are not also suppressed is also important Painless round and pinpoint 1 to 3 mm in diameter petechiae usually appear and fade and sometimes group to form ecchymoses Larger than petechiae ecchymoses are purple blue or yellow green areas of skin that vary in size and shape They can occur anywhere on the body A person with this disease may also complain of malaise fatigue and general weakness with or without accompanying blood loss Acquired thrombocytopenia may be associated with the use of certain drugs Inspection typically reveals evidence of bleeding petechiae or ecchymoses along with slow continuous bleeding from any injuries or wounds Adults may have large blood filled bullae in the mouth If the persons platelet count is between 30 000 and 50 000 mm3 bruising with minor trauma may be expected if it is between 15 000 and 30 000 mm3 spontaneous bruising will be seen mostly on the arms and legs
Oligodendroglioma arise mainly in the frontal lobe and in 50 80 of cases the first symptom is the onset of seizure activity without having any symptoms beforehand Headaches combined with increased intracranial pressure are also a common symptom of oligodendroglioma Depending on the location of the tumor many different neurological deficits can be induced including but not limited to visual loss motor weakness and cognitive decline A computed tomography CT or magnetic resonance imaging MRI scan is necessary to characterize tumor size location and hetero or homogeneity Final diagnosis relies on biopsy and histopathologic examination of the tumor mass
Some of the signs and symptoms of smoke inhalation injury include recent fire exposure followed by cough wheezing stridor confusion difficulty breathing low oxygen saturation smoke debris especially on face and or in saliva burns especially of the face singed facial or nose hairs and or hoarse voice A careful history can be helpful in determining where the fire occurred and therefore what chemical fumes could have been inhaled with accompanying systemic toxicities Smoke inhalation injury can lead to respiratory complications ranging from minor to major Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS is a relatively delayed complication of smoke inhalation injury caused by chemical fumes inducing an inflammatory response in the lung tissue especially the small air sacs known as alveoli where critical gas exchange occurs Another potential complication is swelling of the upper airway from both heat and chemical damage and can become profound enough to obstruct breathing The onset of airway swelling can be relatively delayed making it difficult to intubate later on thus endotracheal intubation should be considered early in certain patients Other possible complications include pneumonia vocal cord damage and or dysfunction and tracheal stenosis usually delayed
In factitious disorder imposed on self the affected person exaggerates or creates symptoms of illnesses in themselves to gain examination treatment attention sympathy or comfort from medical personnel It often involves elements of victim playing and attention seeking In some extreme cases people with Munchausen syndrome are highly knowledgeable about the practice of medicine and are able to produce symptoms that result in lengthy and costly medical analysis prolonged hospital stays and unnecessary operations The role of patient is a familiar and comforting one and it fills a psychological need in people with this syndrome This disorder is distinct from hypochondriasis and other somatoform disorders in that those with the latter do not intentionally produce their somatic symptoms Factitious disorder is distinct from malingering in that people with factitious disorder imposed on self do not fabricate symptoms for material gain such as financial compensation absence from work or access to drugs The exact cause of factitious disorder is not known but researchers believe both biological and psychological factors play a role in the development of this disorder Risk factors for developing factitious disorder may include childhood traumas growing up with parents caretakers who were emotionally unavailable due to illness or emotional problems a serious illness as a child failed aspirations to work in the medical field personality disorders and low self esteem While there are no reliable statistics regarding the number of people in the United States who have factitious disorder FD is believed to be most common in mothers having the above risk factors Those with a history of working in healthcare are also at greater risk of developing it Arrhythmogenic Munchausen syndrome describes individuals who simulate or stimulate cardiac arrhythmias to gain medical attention A related behavior called factitious disorder imposed on another has been documented in the parent or guardian of a child or the owner of a pet animal The adult ensures that their child will experience some medical condition therefore compelling the child to suffer through treatments and spend a significant portion during youth in hospitals Furthermore a disease may actually be initiated in the child by the parent or guardian This condition is considered distinct from Munchausen syndrome There is growing consensus in the pediatric community that this disorder should be renamed medical abuse to highlight the harm caused by the deception and to make it less likely that the sufferer can use a psychiatric defense when harm is done
Early or intermediate AMD may be asymptomatic or it may present with blurred or decreased vision in one or both eyes This may manifest initially as difficulty with reading or driving especially in poorly lit areas Other symptoms of AMD include distortion of vision and blind spots especially in and around the central visual field Other signs and symptoms of macular degeneration include
A list of the common side effects broken down by frequency Very frequent
PDPH typically occurs hours to days after puncture and presents with symptoms such as headache which is mostly bi frontal or occipital and nausea that typically worsen when the patient assumes an upright posture The headache usually occurs 24 48 hours after puncture but may occur as many as 12 days after It usually resolves within a few days but has been rarely documented to take much longer
At birth there is no sign that a child will develop symptoms of aspartylglucosaminuria Typically signs and symptoms become apparent between two and four years of age and become progressively worse as the individual ages The following signs and symptoms may appear
Cogan syndrome is a rare rheumatic disease characterized by inflammation of the ears and eyes Cogan syndrome can lead to vision difficulty hearing loss and dizziness The condition may also be associated with blood vessel inflammation called vasculitis in other areas of the body that can cause major organ damage in 15 of those affected or in a small number of cases even death It most commonly occurs in a persons 20s or 30s The cause is not known However one theory is that it is an autoimmune disorder in which the bodys immune system mistakenly attacks tissue in the eye and ear
Pediatricians are often the first health professionals to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder The initial presentation varies according to the childs developmental and chronological age although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction Infants up to about 18 24 months may present with non organic failure to thrive and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with malnutrition or dehydration while serum growth hormone levels will be normal or elevated The core feature is severely inappropriate social relating by affected children This can manifest itself in three ways
Initial symptoms of spasmodic torticollis are usually mild Some feel an invisible tremor of their head for a few months at onset Then the head may turn pull or tilt in jerky movements or sustain a prolonged position involuntarily Over time the involuntary spasm of the neck muscles will increase in frequency and strength until it reaches a plateau Symptoms can also worsen while the patient is walking or during periods of increased stress Other symptoms include muscle hypertrophy neck pain dysarthria and tremor Studies have shown that over 75 of patients report neck pain and 33 to 40 experience tremor of the head
The symptoms vary depending on the SMA type the stage of the disease as well as individual factors Signs and symptoms below are most common in the severe SMA type 0 I Areflexia particularly in extremities Overall muscle weakness poor muscle tone limpness or a tendency to flop Difficulty achieving developmental milestones difficulty sitting standing walking In small children adopting of a frog leg position when sitting hips abducted and knees flexed Loss of strength of the respiratory muscles weak cough weak cry infants accumulation of secretions in the lungs or throat respiratory distress Bell shaped torso caused by using only abdominal muscles for respiration in severe SMA type Fasciculations twitching of the tongue Difficulty sucking or swallowing poor feeding
Two of the symptoms of flail chest are chest pain and shortness of breath The characteristic paradoxical motion of the flail segment occurs due to pressure changes associated with respiration that the rib cage normally resists
It most often occurs in the middle of the night and lasts from seconds to minutes pain and aching lasting twenty minutes or longer would likely be diagnosed instead as levator ani syndrome In a study published in 2007 involving 1809 patients the attacks occurred in the daytime 33 percent as well as at night 33 percent and the average number of attacks was 13 Onset can be in childhood however in multiple studies the average age of onset was 45 Many studies showed that women are affected more commonly than men but this can be at least partly explained by mens reluctance to seek medical advice concerning rectal pain Data on the number of people affected vary but prevalence may be as high as 8 18 It is thought that only 17 20 of patients consult a physician so obtaining accurate data on occurrence presents a challenge During an episode the patient feels spasm like sometimes excruciating pain in the rectum or anus often misinterpreted as a need to defecate To be diagnosed as proctalgia fugax the pain must arise de novo meaning the absence of clear cause As such pain associated with constipation either chronic or acute penetrative anal intercourse trauma such as tears or fissures of the rectal sphincter or anal canal side effects of some medications particularly opiates or rectal foreign body insertion preclude this diagnosis The pain episode subsides by itself as the spasm disappears on its own but may reoccur Because of the high incidence of internal anal sphincter thickening with the disorder it is thought to be a disorder of that muscle or that it is a neuralgia of pudendal nerves It is not known to be linked to any disease process
Most people will present as nephrotic syndrome with the triad of albuminuria edema and low serum albumin with or without kidney failure High blood pressure and high cholesterol are often also present Others may not have symptoms and may be picked up on screening with urinalysis finding high amounts of protein loss in the urine A definitive diagnosis of membranous nephropathy requires a kidney biopsy though given the very high specificity of anti PLA2R antibody positivity this can sometimes be avoided in patients with nephrotic syndrome and preserved kidney function
Genitopatellar syndrome is characterized by genital abnormalities missing or underdeveloped kneecaps patellae intellectual disability and abnormalities affecting other parts of the body It is also associated with delayed development and intellectual disability which are often severe Affected individuals may have an unusually small head microcephaly and structural brain abnormalities including agenesis of the corpus callosum Major features include Patellar hypoplasia agenesis Flexion contractures at the hips and knees Agenesis of the corpus callosum with microcephaly Hydronephrosis and or multiple kidney cysts Atrial septal defect Intestinal malrotation Talipes equinovarus including club feet Feeding difficultiesOther features may include Dental anomalies delayed eruption of teeth Hearing loss Thyroid anomalies Anal anomalies Hypotonia Global developmental delay intellectual disability
People with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis typically present with a prolonged several month history of unintentional weight loss chronic cough which is normally productive of sputum shortness of breath and haemoptysis One small case series of 18 people found these to be the most common presenting symptoms Less common symptoms include severe fatigue or malaise chest pain sputum production without cough and fever Fever would not typically be expected unless they had the subacute invasive subtype Furthermore it is possible for less severe subtypes to be asymptomatic Beyond the direct symptoms it is possible to have general signs of underlying lung pathology such as digital clubbing especially when there has been an underlying disease such as tuberculosis or where disease has caused heart failure known as cor pulmonale
Although similar in some ways to true hermaphroditism the conditions can be distinguished histologically and by karyotyping The observable characteristics phenotype of this condition are highly variable ranging from gonadal dysgenesis in males to Turner like females and phenotypically normal males The phenotypical expression may be ambiguous male or female depending on the extent of the mosaicism The most common presentation of 45 X 46 XY karyotype is phenotypically normal male next being genital ambiguity There is a range of chromosomal anomalies within 45 X 46 XY where the variations are very complex and the actual result in living individuals is often not a simple picture Most patients with this karyotype are known to have abnormal gonadal histology and heights considerably below their genetic potential High gonadotropin levels have been described in both male and female patients as well as low levels of testosterone in male patients Dosage loss of SHOX gene is commonly associated with short stature Psychomotor development is normal As the gonads may not be symmetrical the development of the Müllerian duct and Wolffian duct may be asymmetrical too Because of the presence of dysgenetic gonadal tissue and Y chromosome material there is a high risk of the development of a gonadoblastoma
Pain on the outer side of the thigh occasionally extending to the outer side of the knee usually constant A burning sensation tingling or numbness in the same area Multiple bee sting like pains in the affected area Occasionally aching in the groin area or pain spreading across the buttocks Usually more sensitive to light touch than to firm pressure Hypersensitivity to heat warm water from shower feels like it is burning the area Occasionally patients may complain of itching or a bothersome sensation rather than pain in the affected area The entire distribution of the nerve is rarely affected Usually the unpleasant sensation s affect only part of the skin supplied by the nerve
Genetics The gene thought to cause some of the cases of Perlman syndrome is DIS3L2 found on chromosome 2 at 2q37 2 and is thought to have an important role in the mitotic cell cycle Although both sexes are affected the sex ratio of male to female is 2 1 The syndrome has been described in both consanguineous and non consanguineous couplings No chromosomal abnormalities have been observed except for in the case of Chernos et al which showed a de novo mutation an extra G positive band a genetic mutation that neither parent possessed nor transmitted on the tip of the short arm of chromosome 11
The following are some of the symptoms of starvation
Symptoms include pain particularly with movement
Deficiency of magnesium can cause tiredness generalized weakness muscle cramps abnormal heart rhythms increased irritability of the nervous system with tremors paresthesias palpitations low potassium levels in the blood hypoparathyroidism which might result in low calcium levels in the blood chondrocalcinosis spasticity and tetany migraines epileptic seizures basal ganglia calcifications and in extreme and prolonged cases coma intellectual disability or death Magnesium plays an important role in carbohydrate metabolism and its deficiency may worsen insulin resistance a condition that often precedes diabetes or may be a consequence of insulin resistance People being treated on an intensive care unit ICU who have a low magnesium level may have a higher risk of requiring mechanical ventilation and death
Rash reddened skin area Itching skin Pimples or pustules located around a hair or follicle may be confused with chicken pox May crust over Typically occur on neck armpit or groin May present as genital lesions Spreading from leg to arm to body through improper treatment with antibiotics
The main symptom of valsalva retinopathy is painless sudden loss of vision Sudden onset floaters and central or paracentral visual field defects and nausea resulting from increased intraocular pressure are other symptoms
The common symptoms include hyper pigmentation of the skin visual disturbances headaches abnormally high levels of beta MSH and ACTH abnormal enlargements of the pituitary gland interruption of menstrual cycles in women
The two major symptoms of Björnstad syndrome are pili torti and sensorineural hearing impairment These two symptoms typically appear before the age of 2 and are present in 80 99 of individuals with Björnstad syndrome Approximately 5 29 of individuals also experience intellectual disabilities and hypogonadism Cases showing lack of hair pigmentation and anhidrosis have also been documented Pili torti is a hair abnormality characterized by twisted hair shafts In Björnstad syndrome patients the hair usually appears dry fragile coarse and is easily broken In some patients hair abnormalities only affect hair on the head although cases affecting eyebrows eyelashes and hair on other parts of the body have been documented Weakening of the hair associated with pili torti also causes alopecia in approximately 80 of patients The severity of hearing loss associated with Björnstad syndrome varies Some individuals are unable to hear sounds at certain frequencies while others are completely deaf Their hearing loss is caused by tissue damage of the inner ear
The symptoms can be mild or severe and may include
Prognosis for PBP patients is poor Progressive bulbar palsy symptoms can include progressive difficulty with talking and swallowing Patients can also exhibit reduced gag reflexes weak palatal movements fasciculations and weak movement of the facial muscles and tongue In advanced cases of PBP patients may be unable to protrude their tongue or manipulate food in their mouth Patients with early cases of PBP have difficulty with pronunciations particularly lateral consonants linguals and velars and may show problems with drooling saliva If the corticobulbar tract is affected a pseudobulbar affect with emotional changes may occur Because PBP patients have such difficulty swallowing food and saliva can be inhaled into the lungs This can cause gagging and choking and it increases the risk of pneumonia Death which is often from pneumonia usually occurs 1 to 3 years after the start of the disorder About twenty five percent of patients with PBP eventually develop the widespread symptoms common to ALS
Classical signs of uremia are progressive weakness and easy fatigue loss of appetite due to nausea and vomiting muscle atrophy tremors abnormal mental function frequent shallow respiration and metabolic acidosis Without intervention via dialysis or kidney transplant uremia due to renal failure will progress and cause stupor coma and death Because uremia is mostly a consequence of kidney failure its signs and symptoms often occur concomitantly with other signs and symptoms of kidney failure Glomerular filtration rate GFR measures the amount of plasma in millilitres being filtered through the kidneys each minute As the GFR decreases the prognosis worsens Some of the effects can be reversed albeit temporarily with dialysis
Neuropathy disorders usually have onset in childhood or young adulthood Motor symptoms seem to be more predominant than sensory symptoms Symptoms of these disorders include fatigue pain lack of balance lack of feeling lack of reflexes and lack of sight and hearing which result from muscle atrophy Patients can also have high arched feet hammer toes foot drop foot deformities and scoliosis These symptoms are a result of severe muscular weakness and atrophy In patients with demyelinating neuropathy symptoms are due to slow nerve conduction velocities however people with axonal degradation have average to normal nerve conduction velocities
Signs and symptoms of mitral stenosis include the following
Irrespective of the cause achlorhydria can result as known complications of bacterial overgrowth and intestinal metaplasia and symptoms are often consistent with those diseases
Rhinophyma is characterised by prominent pores and a fibrous thickening of the nose sometimes with papules It is associated with the common skin condition rosacea and it can be classified clinically into 5 grades of increasing severity
In the human manifestation of the disease E granulosus E multilocularis E oligarthrus and E vogeli are localized in the liver in 75 of cases the lungs in 5 15 of cases and other organs in the body such as the spleen brain heart and kidneys in 10 20 of cases In people who are infected with E granulosus and therefore have cystic echinococcosis the disease develops as a slow growing mass in the body These slow growing masses often called cysts are also found in people that are infected with alveolar and polycystic echinococcosis The cysts found in those with cystic echinococcosis are usually filled with a clear fluid called hydatid fluid are spherical and typically consist of one compartment and are usually only found in one area of the body While the cysts found in those with alveolar and polycystic echinococcosis are similar to those found in those with cystic echinococcosis the alveolar and polycystic echinococcosis cysts usually have multiple compartments and have infiltrative as opposed to expansive growth Depending on the location of the cyst in the body the person could be asymptomatic even though the cysts have grown to be very large or be symptomatic even if the cysts are absolutely tiny If the person is symptomatic the symptoms will depend largely on where the cysts are located For instance if the person has cysts in the lungs and is symptomatic they will have a cough shortness of breath and or pain in the chest On the other hand if the person has cysts in the liver and is symptomatic they will experience abdominal pain abnormal abdominal tenderness hepatomegaly with an abdominal mass jaundice fever and or anaphylactic reaction In addition if the cysts were to rupture while in the body whether during surgical extraction of the cysts or by trauma to the body the person would most likely go into anaphylactic shock and have high fever pruritus itching edema swelling of the lips and eyelids dyspnea stridor and rhinorrhea Unlike intermediate hosts definitive hosts are usually not hurt very much by the infection Sometimes a lack of certain vitamins and minerals can be caused in the host by the very high demand of the parasite The incubation period for all species of Echinococcus can be months to years or even decades It largely depends on the location of the cyst in the body and how fast the cyst is growing
A subconjunctival bleeding usually does not result in pain although occasionally the affected eye may feel dry rough or scratchy A subconjunctival bleeding initially appears bright red underneath the transparent conjunctiva Later the bleeding may spread and become green or yellow as the hemoglobin is metabolized It usually disappears within 2 weeks
Women with this condition experience a constant pain that may be dull and aching but is occasionally more acute The pain is worse at the end of the day and after long periods of standing and those affected get relief when they lie down The pain is worse during or after sexual intercourse and can be worse just before the onset of the menstrual period Women with pelvic congestion syndrome have a larger uterus and a thicker endometrium 56 of women manifest cystic changes to the ovaries and many report other symptoms such as dysmenorrhea back pain vaginal discharge abdominal bloating mood swings or depression and fatigue
Symptoms may include pain orthopnea shortness of breath when lying flat and coughing In people with herniation of abdominal organs signs of intestinal blockage or sepsis in the abdomen may be present Bowel sounds may be heard in the chest and shoulder or epigastric pain may be present When the injury is not noticed right away the main symptoms are those that indicate bowel obstruction
Causes Brunner syndrome is caused by a monoamine oxidase A MAOA deficiency which leads to an excess of monoamines in the brain such as serotonin dopamine and norepinephrine noradrenaline In both mice and humans a mutation was located on the eighth exon of the MAO A gene which created a dysfunctional MAO A gene The regular function of MAO A breaking down monoamines is disrupted and monoamines build up within the brain Mice that lacked a functional MAO A gene displayed higher levels of aggression in comparison to mice with a functional MAO A gene
The most common signs symptoms of DAVFs are Pulsatile tinnitus Occipital bruit Headache Visual impairment PapilledemaPulsatile tinnitus is the most common symptom in patients and it is associated with transverse sigmoid sinus DAVFs Carotid cavernous DAVFs on the other hand are more closely associated with pulsatile exophthalmos DAVFs may also be asymptomatic e g cavernous sinus DAVFs
Cardiac arrythmias dizziness fast breathing shortness of breath PULMONARY EDEMA
There are two main characteristics of narcolepsy excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal REM sleep Excessive daytime sleepiness occurs even after adequate night time sleep A person with narcolepsy is likely to become drowsy or fall asleep often at inappropriate or undesired times and places or just be very tired throughout the day Narcoleptics may not be able to experience the amount of restorative deep sleep that healthy people experience due to abnormal REM regulation they are not over sleeping Narcoleptics typically have higher REM sleep density than non narcoleptics but also experience more REM sleep without atonia Many narcoleptics have sufficient REM sleep but do not feel refreshed or alert throughout the day This can feel like living their entire lives in a constant state of sleep deprivation Excessive sleepiness can vary in severity and it appears most commonly during monotonous situations that dont require much interaction Daytime naps may occur with little warning and may be physically irresistible These naps can occur several times a day They are typically refreshing but only for a few hours or less Vivid dreams may be experienced on a regular basis even during very brief naps Drowsiness may persist for prolonged periods or remain constant In addition night time sleep may be fragmented with frequent awakenings A second prominent symptom of narcolepsy is abnormal REM sleep Narcoleptics are unique in that they enter into the REM phase of sleep in the beginnings of sleep even when sleeping during the day The classic symptoms of the disorder often referred to as the tetrad of narcolepsy are cataplexy sleep paralysis hypnagogic hallucinations and excessive daytime sleepiness Other symptoms may include automatic behaviors and night time wakefulness These symptoms may not occur in all people with narcolepsy
The headaches can vary greatly in their clinical presentation and duration Quality of the headache has been described as dull and or pressure like sensation and throbbing and or pulsating sensation The pain is usually on both sides of the head in 88 93 of people with NDPH but may be unilateral and may be localized to any head region The pain can fluctuate in intensity and duration is daily and lasts more than 3 months There may be accompanying photophobia phonophobia lightheadedness or mild nausea Co morbidity with mood disorders has been reported in a subset of patients Cranial autonomic nervous symptoms occur with painful exacerbations in 21 and cutaneous allodynia may be present in 26 In 2002 Li and Rozen conducted a study of 56 patients at the Jefferson Headache Center in Philadelphia and published the following results
Pagets disease of the breast can affect the nipple and areola Symptoms typically only affect one breast Symptoms may include
Schizophreniform disorder is a type of mental illness that is characterized by psychosis and closely related to schizophrenia Both schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM IV TR have the same symptoms and essential features except for two differences the level of functional impairment and the duration of symptoms Impairment in social occupational or academic functioning is usually present in schizophrenia particularly near the time of first diagnosis but such impairment may or may not be present in schizophreniform disorder In schizophreniform disorder the symptoms including prodromal active and residual phases must last at least 1 month but not more than 6 months while in schizophrenia the symptoms must be present for a minimum of 6 months
Most fetal rhabdomyomas are tumors that develop in the head and neck or in the genital region There are a number of cases which have been seen in association with Gorlin syndrome However cardiac myxomas are known to be associated with tuberous sclerosis
Affected individuals typically experience limited relief from standard pain relieving medication with the exception of some neuroleptic agents Patients frequently experience pseudovisceral phenomena or symptoms of altered autonomic nervous system function including nausea bloating abdominal swelling loss of appetite with consecutively lowered body weight or an altered defecation process Pain is typically related to tensing the abdominal wall muscles so any type of movement is prone to aggravate pain Lying quietly can be the least painful position Most patients report that they cannot sleep on the painful side
Symptoms traditionally linked to SIBO include bloating diarrhea and abdominal pain discomfort Steatorrhea may be seen in more severe cases Bacterial overgrowth can cause a variety of symptoms many of which are also found in other conditions making the diagnosis challenging at times Many of the symptoms are due to malabsorption of nutrients due to the effects of bacteria which either metabolize nutrients or cause inflammation of the small bowel impairing absorption The symptoms of bacterial overgrowth include nausea flatus constipation bloating abdominal distension abdominal pain or discomfort diarrhea fatigue and weakness SIBO also causes an increased permeability of the small intestine Some patients may lose weight Children with bacterial overgrowth may develop malnutrition and have difficulty attaining proper growth Steatorrhea a sticky type of diarrhea where fats are not properly absorbed and spill into the stool may also occur Patients with bacterial overgrowth that is longstanding can develop complications of their illness as a result of malabsorption of nutrients Laboratory test results may include elevated folate and less commonly vitamin B12 deficiency or other nutritional deficiencies Anemia may occur from a variety of mechanisms as many of the nutrients involved in production of red blood cells are absorbed in the affected small bowel Iron is absorbed in the more proximal parts of the small bowel the duodenum and jejunum and patients with malabsorption of iron can develop a microcytic anemia with small red blood cells Vitamin B12 is absorbed in the last part of the small bowel the ileum and patients who malabsorb vitamin B12 can develop a megaloblastic anemia with large red blood cells
Symptoms are dependent on the type of TBI diffuse or focal and the part of the brain that is affected Unconsciousness tends to last longer for people with injuries on the left side of the brain than for those with injuries on the right Symptoms are also dependent on the injurys severity With mild TBI the patient may remain conscious or may lose consciousness for a few seconds or minutes Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache vomiting nausea lack of motor coordination dizziness difficulty balancing lightheadedness blurred vision or tired eyes ringing in the ears bad taste in the mouth fatigue or lethargy and changes in sleep patterns Cognitive and emotional symptoms include behavioral or mood changes confusion and trouble with memory concentration attention or thinking Mild TBI symptoms may also be present in moderate and severe injuries A person with a moderate or severe TBI may have a headache that does not go away repeated vomiting or nausea convulsions an inability to awaken dilation of one or both pupils slurred speech aphasia word finding difficulties dysarthria muscle weakness that causes disordered speech weakness or numbness in the limbs loss of coordination confusion restlessness or agitation Common long term symptoms of moderate to severe TBI are changes in appropriate social behavior deficits in social judgment and cognitive changes especially problems with sustained attention processing speed and executive functioning Alexithymia a deficiency in identifying understanding processing and describing emotions occurs in 60 9 of individuals with TBI Cognitive and social deficits have long term consequences for the daily lives of people with moderate to severe TBI but can be improved with appropriate rehabilitation When the pressure within the skull intracranial pressure abbreviated ICP rises too high it can be deadly Signs of increased ICP include decreasing level of consciousness paralysis or weakness on one side of the body and a blown pupil one that fails to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so Cushings triad a slow heart rate with high blood pressure and respiratory depression is a classic manifestation of significantly raised ICP Anisocoria unequal pupil size is another sign of serious TBI Abnormal posturing a characteristic positioning of the limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high ICP is an ominous sign Small children with moderate to severe TBI may have some of these symptoms but have difficulty communicating them Other signs seen in young children include persistent crying inability to be consoled listlessness refusal to nurse or eat and irritability
The primary symptom of prepatellar bursitis is swelling of the area around the kneecap It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly The area may be red erythema warm to the touch or surrounded by cellulitis particularly if infection is present often accompanied by fever p 608 Unlike arthritis except in severe cases prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee though it may cause some discomfort in complete flexion of the joint p 360 Flexion and extension of the knee may be accompanied by crepitus the audible grating of bones ligaments or particles within the excess synovial fluid p 20
Malocclusion is a common finding although it is not usually serious enough to require treatment Those who have more severe malocclusions which present as a part of craniofacial anomalies may require orthodontic and sometimes surgical treatment orthognathic surgery to correct the problem The ultimate goal of orthodontic treatment is to achieve a stable functional and aesthetic alignment of teeth which serves to better the patients dental and total health The symptoms which arise as a result of malocclusion derive from a deficiency in one or more of these categories The symptoms are as follows
The primary symptom of laryngitis is a hoarse voice 108 Because laryngitis can have various causes other signs and symptoms may vary They can include
SVT is recognized by the presence of pain warmth redness and tenderness over a superficial vein The SVT may present as a cord like structure upon palpation The affected vein may be hard along its entire length SVTs tend to involve the legs though they can affect any superficial vein e g those in the arms
The symptoms of Freeman Sheldon syndrome include drooping of the upper eyelids strabismus low set ears a long philtrum gradual hearing loss scoliosis and walking difficulties Gastroesophageal reflux has been noted during infancy but usually improves with age The tongue may be small and the limited movement of the soft palate may cause nasal speech Often there is an H or Y shaped dimpling of the skin over the chin
The age of onset of the Emberger syndrome is variable with rare individuals showing first symptoms such as lymphedema occurring in early infancy while others are symptomless or develop first symptoms in their middle and latter years This variability can occur between members of the same family who are documented to have the same GATA2 mutation The syndromes most common times of onset are infancy and early childhood The syndrome may present with unexplained lymphedema hearing loss and or hematological defects like neutropenia anemia thrombocytopenia and or the circulation of abnormal blood cells Other defects less commonly associated with and the syndrome include hypotelorism epicanthic folds hydrocele webbed neck and warts caused be human papillomavirus infection In these case of relatively benign symptoms and signs the syndrome commonly progresses rapidly or slowly to myelodysplastic syndrome followed by acute myeloid leukemia Less commonly Emberger syndrome presents with the myelodysplastic syndrome and or acute myeloid leukemia
Patients present with a slow growing painless solitary mass usually of the subcutaneous tissues It is much less frequently noted in the intramuscular tissue It is not uncommon for symptoms to be present for years Benign neoplasm with brown fat is noted
The signs and symptoms include gluteal pain that may radiate down buttock and the leg and that is made worse in some sitting positions
Parkinsonism is a clinical syndrome characterized by the four motor symptoms found in Parkinsons disease tremor bradykinesia slowed movements rigidity and postural instability Parkinsonism gait problems can lead to falls and serious physical injuries Other common symptoms include
Signs and symptoms include erythema redness or flushing and sweating in the cutaneous distribution of the auriculotemporal nerve usually in response to gustatory stimuli There is sometimes pain in the same area often burning in nature Between attacks of pain there may be numbness or other altered sensations anesthesia or paresthesia This is sometimes termed gustatory neuralgia
Some emotional signs of adjustment disorder are sadness hopelessness lack of enjoyment crying spells nervousness anxiety desperation feeling overwhelmed and thoughts of suicide performing poorly in school work etc Common characteristics of Adjustment disorder include mild depressive symptoms anxiety symptoms and traumatic stress symptoms or a combination of the three According to the DSM 5 there are six types of Adjustment disorder which are characterized by the following predominant symptoms depressed mood anxiety mixed depression and anxiety disturbance of conduct mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct and unspecified However the criteria for these symptoms are not specified in greater detail Adjustment disorder may be acute or chronic depending on whether it lasts more or less than six months According to the DSM 5 if the Adjustment disorder lasts less than six months then it may be considered acute If it lasts more than six months it may be considered chronic Moreover the symptoms cannot last longer than six months after the stressor s or its consequences have terminated 679 However the stress related disturbance does not only exist as an exacerbation of a pre existing mental disorder Unlike major depression the disorder is caused by an outside stressor and generally resolves once the individual is able to adapt to the situation The condition is different from anxiety disorder which lacks the presence of a stressor or post traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder which usually are associated with a more intense stressor Suicidal behavior is prominent among people with Adjustment disorder of all ages and up to one fifth of adolescent suicide victims may have an adjustment disorder Bronish and Hecht 1989 found that 70 of a series of patients with Adjustment disorder attempted suicide immediately before their index admission and they remitted faster than a comparison group with major depression Asnis et al 1993 found that Adjustment disorder patients report persistent ideation or suicide attempts less frequently than those diagnosed with major depression According to a study on 82 Adjustment disorder patients at a clinic Bolu et al 2012 found that 22 26 8 of these patients were admitted due to suicide attempt consistent with previous findings In addition it was found that 15 of these 22 patients chose suicide methods that involved high chances of being saved Henriksson et al 2005 states statistically that the stressors are of one half related to parental issues and one third in peer issues One hypothesis about Adjustment disorder is that it may represent a sub threshold clinical syndrome
Though any cartilage in the body may be affected in persons with relapsing polychondritis in many cases the disease affects several areas while sparing others The disease may be variable in its signs and symptoms resulting in a difficult diagnosis which may leads to delayed recognition for several months years or decades Joint symptoms are often one of the first signs of the disease with cartilage inflammation initially absent in nearly half the cases
SCA13 is typified by early onset mildly progressive cerebellar ataxia with accompanying dysarthria mental retardation and nystagmus Symptoms and age of onset can vary slightly according to the causative mutation
Signs and symptoms of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema vary based on the cause but it is often associated with swelling of the neck and chest pain and may also involve sore throat neck pain difficulty swallowing wheezing and difficulty breathing Chest X rays may show air in the mediastinum the middle of the chest cavity A significant case of subcutaneous emphysema is easy to detect by touching the overlying skin it feels like tissue paper or Rice Krispies Touching the bubbles causes them to move and sometimes make a crackling noise The air bubbles which are painless and feel like small nodules to the touch may burst when the skin above them is palpated The tissues surrounding SCE are usually swollen When large amounts of air leak into the tissues the face can swell considerably In cases of subcutaneous emphysema around the neck there may be a feeling of fullness in the neck and the sound of the voice may change If SCE is particularly extreme around the neck and chest the swelling can interfere with breathing The air can travel to many parts of the body including the abdomen and limbs because there are no separations in the fatty tissue in the skin to prevent the air from moving
It typically presents as a severe encephalopathy with myoclonic seizures is rapidly progressive and eventually results in respiratory arrest Standard evaluation for inborn errors of metabolism and other causes of this presentation does not reveal any abnormality no acidosis no hypoglycaemia or hyperammonaemia and no other organ affected Pronounced and sustained hiccups in an encephalopathic infant have been described as a typical observation in non ketotic hyperglycinaemia
Symptoms include Labor extends beyond 18 hours Dehydration and exhaustion of the mother Pain around the back sides and thighs of the mother as a result of extreme muscle pressure Severe pain when labor begins Increased heart rate of the mother Swollen large intestine on either side of the uterus as a result of gas build up Uterus sensitivity Ketosis Distress of the fetus Uterine ruptures
Individuals with a basal cell carcinoma typically present with a shiny pearly skin nodule However superficial basal cell cancer can present as a red patch similar to eczema Infiltrative or morpheaform basal cell cancers can present as a skin thickening or scar tissue making diagnosis difficult without using tactile sensation and a skin biopsy It is often difficult to visually distinguish basal cell cancer from acne scar actinic elastosis and recent cryodestruction inflammation
The excess fluid primarily salt and water builds up in various locations in the body and leads to an increase in weight swelling in the legs and arms peripheral edema and or fluid in the abdomen ascites Eventually the fluid enters the air spaces in the lungs pulmonary edema reduces the amount of oxygen that can enter the blood leading to Anemia and causes shortness of breath dyspnea or enters pleural space by transudation pleural effusion which also causes dyspnea which is the best indicator of estimating central venous pressure is increased It can also cause swelling of the face Fluid can also collect in the lungs when lying down at night possibly making nighttime breathing and sleeping difficult paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
Symptoms of XDR TB are no different from ordinary or drug susceptible TB a cough with thick cloudy mucus or sputum sometimes with blood for more than two weeks fever chills and night sweats fatigue and muscle weakness weight loss and in some cases shortness of breath and chest pain A person with these symptoms does not necessarily have XDR TB but they should see a physician for diagnosis and a treatment plan TB patients whose symptoms do not improve after a few weeks of treatment for TB and are taking treatment should inform their clinician or nurse
Patients with alkaptonuria are asymptomatic as children or young adults but their urine may turn brown or even inky black if collected and left exposed to open air Pigmentation may be noted in the cartilage of the ear and other cartilage and the sclera and corneal limbus of the eye After the age of 30 people begin to develop pain in the weight bearing joints of the spine hips and knees The pain can be severe to the point that interferes with activities of daily living and may affect the ability to work Joint replacement surgery hip and shoulder is often necessary at a relatively young age In the longer term the involvement of the spinal joints leads to reduced movement of the rib cage and can affect breathing Bone mineral density may be affected increasing the risk of bone fractures and rupture of tendons and muscles may occur Valvular heart disease mainly calcification and regurgitation of the aortic and mitral valves may occur and in severe and progressive cases valve replacement may be necessary Irregularities in the heart rhythm and heart failure affect a significant proportion of people with alkaptonuria 40 and 10 respectively Hearing loss affects 40 of people Also a propensity to developing kidney stones exists and eventually also gallstones and stones in the prostate and salivary glands sialolithiasis can occur
Most cases involve a small and bifid penis which requires surgical closure soon after birth often including a reconstruction of the urethra Where it is part of a larger exstrophy not only the urethra but also the bladder bladder exstrophy or the entire perineum cloacal exstrophy are open and exposed on birth requiring closure Many parts of this article are incorrect
In neonates born at or beyond 35 weeks neonatal encephalopathy may present itself as the following symptoms Reduced level of consciousness Seizures which peak at 48 hours Difficulty initiating and maintaining respiration Depression of tone and reflexes
AHC patients exhibit a wide range of symptoms in addition to hemiplegic attacks These can be further characterized as paroxysmal and non paroxysmal symptoms Paroxysmal symptoms are generally associated with hemiplegic attacks and may occur suddenly with hemiplegia or on their own Paroxysmal symptoms may last for variable amounts of time Non paroxysmal symptoms tend to be side effects of AHC which are present at all times not just during episodes or attacks Epilepsy which is also considered a paroxysmal symptom plays an important role in the progression and diagnosis of AHC
About 96 of individuals with AD present with severe pain that had a sudden onset The pain may be described as a tearing stabbing or sharp sensation in the chest back or abdomen About 17 of individuals feel the pain migrate as the dissection extends down the aorta The location of pain is associated with the location of the dissection Anterior chest pain is associated with dissections involving the ascending aorta while interscapular back pain is associated with descending aortic dissections If the pain is pleuritic in nature it may suggest acute pericarditis caused by bleeding into the sac surrounding the heart This is a particularly dangerous eventuality suggesting that acute pericardial tamponade may be imminent Pericardial tamponade is the most common cause of death from AD While the pain may be confused with that of a heart attack AD is usually not associated with the other suggestive signs such as heart failure and ECG changes Less common symptoms that may be seen in the setting of AD include congestive heart failure 7 fainting 9 stroke 6 ischemic peripheral neuropathy paraplegia and cardiac arrest If the individual fainted about half the time it is due to bleeding into the pericardium leading to pericardial tamponade Neurological complications of aortic dissection such as stroke and paralysis are due to the involvement of one or more arteries supplying portions of the central nervous system If the AD involves the abdominal aorta compromise of one or both renal arteries occurs in 5 8 of cases while ischemia of the intestines occurs about 3 of the time
The signs and symptoms of ureterocele in the latter two forms can easily be confused with other medical conditions Symptoms can include Frequent urinary tract infections Pyelonephritis Obstructive voiding symptoms Urinary retention Failure to thrive Hematuria Cyclic abdominal pain Urolithiasis Cobra head sign is seen in radiography In females salpingitis hydrosalpinx with sepsis or torsion T O mass
The severity of glutaric acidemia type 1 varies widely some individuals are only mildly affected while others suffer severe problems GA1 can be defined as two clinical entities GA 1 diagnosed at birth or pre birth and managed through dietary restrictions and GA 1 diagnosed after an encephalopathic crisis A crisis may occur under both headings but the care of individuals diagnosed before a crisis can be managed to avoid most or all injury
Gastrinoma in the early stages will have signs and symptoms of indigestion or similar to irritable bowel disease IBD such as
Symptoms of this disease include deterioration of motor functions and speech seizures and other involuntary movement Other symptoms are headaches dementia and vision impairment Characteristics of Parkinsons Disease are also similar to PFBC The disease usually manifests itself in the third to fifth decade of life but may appear in childhood or later in life It usually presents with clumsiness fatigability unsteady gait slow or slurred speech difficulty swallowing involuntary movements or muscle cramping Seizures of various types are common Neuropsychiatric symptoms which may be the first or the most prominent manifestations range from mild difficulty with concentration and memory to changes in personality and or behavior to psychosis and dementia
The signs symptoms of polyonychia are very easy to detect two or more nails growing on the same finger or toe The nails can either be separate small nails micronychia or one wide almost complete nail the digit affected could also be wider than normal
Often heterotopic pancreas is asymptomatic When present symptoms may include abdominal pain and distension Often heterotopic pancreas is recognized as an incidental finding on imaging studies performed for an unrelated reason Ectopic pancreatic tissue may occur anywhere in the abdominal cavity though more than 90 percent are found in the stomach duodenum or jejunum Rarely pancreatic heterotopic tissue may be found in the colon spleen or liver
Ocular hypertension IOP 30 70 mmHg with open angle of anterior chamber and unilateral mild granulomatous anterior uveitis are hallmark signs of Posner Schlossman syndrome On slit lamp examination conjunctival injections epithelial corneal edema small to medium sized fine keratitic precipitates aqueous cells and flare may also be noted Blurring of vision eye pain and discomfort are the main symptoms Colored halos may occur due to elevated IOP Symptoms last from several hours to weeks and may be recurrent IOP and aqueous humor outflow return to normal in the remission periods
Patients can have pain secondary to uterine contractions uterine tetany or localized uterine tenderness Signs can also be due to abruptio placentae including uterine hypertonus fetal distress fetal death and rarely hypovolemic shock shock secondary to severe blood loss The uterus may adopt a bluish purplish mottled appearance due to extravasation of blood into uterine muscle
Small cell carcinoma of the lung usually presents in the central airways and infiltrates the submucosa leading to narrowing of bronchial airways Common symptoms include cough dyspnea weight loss and debility Over 70 of patients with small cell carcinoma present with metastatic disease common sites include liver adrenals bone and brain Due to its high grade neuroendocrine nature small cell carcinomas can produce ectopic hormones including adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH and anti diuretic hormone ADH Ectopic production of large amounts of ADH leads to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion SIADH Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome LEMS is a well known paraneoplastic condition linked to small cell carcinoma
An attack often begins with muscle pain cramping and stiffness This is followed by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly usually in late evening or the early hours of the morning The weakness is usually symmetrical the limb muscles closer to the trunk proximal are predominantly affected and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms Muscles of the mouth and throat eyes and breathing are usually not affected but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life threatening respiratory failure Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days even in the absence of treatment On neurological examination during an attack flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted reflexes are usually diminished but the sensory system is unaffected Mental status is not affected Attacks may be brought on by physical exertion drinking alcohol or eating food high in carbohydrates or salt This may explain why attacks are more common in summer when more people drink sugary drinks and engage in exercise Exercise related attacks tend to occur during a period of rest immediately after exercise exercise may therefore be recommended to abort an attack There may be symptoms of thyroid overactivity such as weight loss a fast heart rate tremor and perspiration but such symptoms occur in only half of all cases The most common type of hyperthyroidism Graves disease may additionally cause eye problems Graves ophthalmopathy and skin changes of the legs pretibial myxedema Thyroid disease may also cause muscle weakness in the form of thyrotoxic myopathy but this is constant rather than episodic
HSV infection causes several distinct medical disorders Common infection of the skin or mucosa may affect the face and mouth orofacial herpes genitalia genital herpes or hands herpetic whitlow More serious disorders occur when the virus infects and damages the eye herpes keratitis or invades the central nervous system damaging the brain herpes encephalitis People with immature or suppressed immune systems such as newborns transplant recipients or people with AIDS are prone to severe complications from HSV infections HSV infection has also been associated with cognitive deficits of bipolar disorder and Alzheimers disease although this is often dependent on the genetics of the infected person In all cases HSV is never removed from the body by the immune system Following a primary infection the virus enters the nerves at the site of primary infection migrates to the cell body of the neuron and becomes latent in the ganglion As a result of primary infection the body produces antibodies to the particular type of HSV involved which can help reduce the odds of a subsequent infection of that type at a different site In HSV 1 infected individuals seroconversion after an oral infection helps prevent additional HSV 1 infections such as whitlow genital herpes and herpes of the eye Prior HSV 1 seroconversion seems to reduce the symptoms of a later HSV 2 infection although HSV 2 can still be contracted Many people infected with HSV 2 display no physical symptoms individuals with no symptoms are described as asymptomatic or as having subclinical herpes However infection with herpes can be fatal
The most distinctive feature of PEPD is episodic burning pain of the rectum ocular and mandibular regions It should be stressed that while pain often originates or is centered in these areas it can also spread or be diffuse in nature Pain experienced by patients with this disorder should not be underestimated as women with the disorder who have also given birth describe PEPD pain as worse than labor pain Concomitant with this pain is typically flushing often in an area associated with the pain During attacks in infants the child often looks startled or terrified and can scream inconsolably These attacks can be precipitated by injections defecation wiping of the perineum eating or the consumption of oral medication When attacks occur due to such precipitation pain and flushing are often present in the area of attack precipitation though symptoms may also be diffuse in nature Other symptoms may include hypersalivation when attacks are localized in the mandibular region or leg weakness after foot trauma A prominent non physical symptom are tonic non epileptic seizures Such seizures are more common in infancy and childhood than during adulthood In older children inconsolable screaming usually precedes such attack followed by apnea paleness and stiffness Such stiffness can last from seconds to a few minutes Attack precipitants are usually physical in nature such as defecation eating or taking medicine Some less common precipitants are micturition coitus and painful stimuli There are also non physical precipitants such as the thought or sight of food In general attacks tend to occur in the precipitated area though this is not always the case While some individuals have described a build up to attacks in general they tend to be abrupt The duration of these attacks can be from a few seconds to two hours Patients are largely normal between attacks The only notable interictal problem is constipation likely due to apprehension of precipitating an attack This symptom often decreases with age likely due to coping mechanisms such as the use of stool softeners
The typical symptoms of RPON are recurrent headaches and ipsilateral paralysis of the extraocular muscles ophthalmoplegia that are responsible for controlling eye movements People with RPON experience different severity of pain duration of symptoms and frequency of attacks which are also dependent on the treatment they received The attacks of RPON usually occur on the same side of the head in subsequent episodes
The condition varies from a mild self limited rash E multiforme minor to a severe life threatening form known as erythema multiforme major or erythema multiforme majus that also involves mucous membranes Consensus classification Erythema multiforme minor typical targets or raised edematous papules distributed acrally Erythema multiforme major typical targets or raised edematous papules distributed acrally with involvement of one or more mucous membranes epidermal detachment involves less than 10 of total body surface areaStevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis used to be considered part of the erythema multiforme spectrum but that is no longer the case The mild form usually presents with mildly itchy but itching can be very severe pink red blotches symmetrically arranged and starting on the extremities It often takes on the classical target lesion appearance with a pink red ring around a pale center Resolution within 7 10 days is the norm Individuals with persistent chronic erythema multiforme will often have a lesion form at an injury site e g a minor scratch or abrasion within a week Irritation or even pressure from clothing will cause the erythema sore to continue to expand along its margins for weeks or months long after the original sore at the center heals
Symptoms of fat embolism syndrome FES can start from 12 hours to 3 days after diagnosis of the underlying clinical disease The three most characteristic features are respiratory distress neurological features and skin petechiae Respiratory distress present in 75 of the cases can vary from mild distress which requires supplemental oxygen to severe distress which requires mechanical ventilation For neurologic features those who have FES may become lethargic restless with a drop in Glasgow Coma Scale GCS due to cerebral oedema rather than cerebral ischaemia Therefore neurological signs are not lateralised to one side of the body In the severe form of cerebral odema a person may become unresponsive Petechiae rash usually happens in 50 of the patients Such skin manifestation is temporary and can disappear within one day The fat embolism syndrome can be divided into three types Subclinical FES It manifests as reduced partial pressure of oxygen PaO2 on arterial blood gas ABG with deranged blood parameters reduced haemoglobin or thrombocytopenia associated with fever pain discomfort tachypnoea tachycardia However there is no respiratory distress However it is often confused with post operative symptoms of fever pain and discomfort Subacute FES non fulminant FES The three characteristic features of fat embolism are present respiratory distress neurological signs and skin petechiae Petechiae are seen on the chest axilla shoulder and mouth Occulsion of dermal capillaries by the fat emboli result in petechial rash Petechiae rash occurs in 50 to 60 of the cases Neurologic signs such as confusion stupor and coma may be present These are usually temporary and do not happen on one side of the body Respiratory distress can be mild and tends to improve on the third day Retinal changes similar to Purtschers retinopathy may also be present Retinal changes happens in 50 of the patients with FES These are the cotton wool exudates and small haemorrhages along the retinal vessels and macula Fulminant FES This type of FES is much rarer than the above two types It usually happens within the first few hours of the injury The three characteristics of FES existed in the most severe form Cause of death is usually due to acute right heart failure
It is possible for a person to be infected with monkeypox without showing any symptoms Monkeypox symptoms tend to begin 5 to 21 days after infection with early symptoms including headache muscle pains fever and fatigue initially resembling influenza Within a few days of the fever lesions characteristically appear on the face before appearing on the trunk then elsewhere such as palms of the hands and soles of the feet The disease can resemble chickenpox measles and smallpox but is distinguished by the presence of swollen glands which may appear behind the ear below the jaw in the neck or in the groin before the onset of the rash Many cases in the 2022 monkeypox outbreak presented with genital and peri anal lesions fever swollen lymph nodes and pain when swallowing with some patients manifesting only single sores from the disease Three quarters of affected people have lesions on the palms and soles more than two thirds in the mouth a third on the genitals and one in five have lesions in the eyes They begin as small flat spots before becoming small bumps which then fill with at first clear fluid and then yellow fluid which subsequently burst and scab over persisting for around ten days There may be a few lesions or several thousand sometimes merging to produce large lesions After healing the lesions may leave pale marks before becoming dark scars An unwell person may remain so for two to four weeks
The early lesions are usually asymptomatic The patients presenting with an advanced stage of the disease comprises around 66 77 of the cases The most important signs include a lump in the neck when palpated and weight loss People may also present with fatigue as a symptom The primary tumor does not have readily discernible signs or symptoms as they grow within the tonsillar capsule It is difficult to notice anything suspicious on examination of the tonsil other than slight enlargement or the development of firmness around the area The carcinoma may occur in one or more sites deep within the tonsillar crypts It may be accompanied by the enlargement of the tonsil The affected tonsil grows into the oropharyngeal space making it noticeable by the patient in the form of a neck mass mostly in the jugulodigastric region As the tonsils consist of a rich network of lymphatics the carcinoma may metastasize to the neck lymph nodes which many are cystic Extension of tumor to skull or mediastinum can occur The additional symptoms include a painful throat dysphagia otalgia due to cranial nerve involvement foreign body sensation bleeding fixation of tongue infiltration of deep muscles and trismus if the pterygoid muscle is involved in the parapharyngeal space On the other hand the tumor may also present as a deep red or white fungating wound growing outwards breaking the skin surface with a central ulceration This wound like ulcer fails to heal non healing leading to bleeding and throat pain and other associated symptoms During biopsy the lesion may show three signs gritty texture firmness and cystification owing to keratinization fibrosis and necrosis respectively Cervical lymphydenopathy may be present
RA primarily affects joints but it also affects other organs in more than 15 25 of cases Associated problems include cardiovascular disease osteoporosis interstitial lung disease infection cancer feeling tired depression mental difficulties and trouble working
Hairy tongue largely occurs in the central part of the dorsal tongue just anterior in front of the circumvallate papillae although sometimes the entire dorsal surface may be involved Discoloration usually accompanies hairy tongue and may be yellow brown or black Apart from the appearance the condition is typically asymptomatic but sometimes people may experience a gagging sensation or a bad taste There may also be associated oral malodor intra oral halitosis The term melanoglossia is also used to refer to there being black discolorations on the tongue without hairs which are also harmless and unrelated to black hairy tongue
A ganglioneuroma is typically asymptomatic and is typically only discovered when being examined or treated for another condition Any symptoms will depend upon the tumors location and the nearby organs affected For example a tumor in the chest area may cause breathing difficulty chest pain and trachea compression If the tumor is located lower in the abdomen it may cause abdominal pain and bloating A tumor near the spinal cord may cause spinal deformity or spinal compression leading to pain and loss of muscle control or sensation in the legs and or arms These tumors may produce certain hormones which can cause diarrhea an enlarged clitoris in females high blood pressure increased body hair and sweating
Most common
CHED presents congenitally but has a stationary course The cornea exhibits a variable degree of clouding from a diffuse haze to a ground glass appearance with occasional focal gray spots The cornea thickens to between two and three times is normal thickness Rarely sub epithelial band keratopathy and elevated intraocular pressure occur Patients have blurred vision and nystagmus however it is rare for the condition to be associated with either epiphora or photophobia with this
Pulseless electrical activity leads to a loss of cardiac output and the blood supply to the brain is interrupted As a result PEA is usually noticed when a person loses consciousness and stops breathing spontaneously This is confirmed by examining the airway for obstruction observing the chest for respiratory movement and feeling the pulse usually at the carotid artery for a period of 10 seconds
Symptoms of lithium toxicity can be mild moderate or severe Mild symptoms include nausea feeling tired and tremor occur at a level of 1 5 to 2 5 mEq L Moderate symptoms include confusion an increased heart rate and low muscle tone occur at a level of 2 5 to 3 5 mEq L Severe symptoms include coma seizures low blood pressure and increased body temperature which occur at a lithium concentration greater than 3 5 mEq L When lithium overdoses produce neurological deficits or cardiac toxicity the symptoms are considered serious and can be fatal
Meningitis The patient with meningococcal meningitis typically presents with high fever nuchal rigidity stiff neck Kernigs sign severe headache vomiting purpura photophobia and sometimes chills altered mental status or seizures Diarrhea or respiratory symptoms are less common Petechiae are often also present but do not always occur so their absence should not be used against the diagnosis of meningococcal disease Anyone with symptoms of meningococcal meningitis should receive intravenous antibiotics before the results of lumbar puncture as delay in treatment worsens the prognosis
Symptoms include opsoclonus rapid involuntary multivectorial horizontal and vertical unpredictable conjugate fast eye movements without intersaccadic quick rotation of the eyes intervals myoclonus brief involuntary twitching of a muscle or a group of muscles cerebellar ataxia both truncal and appendicular aphasia a language disorder in which there is an impairment of speech and of comprehension of speech caused by brain damage mutism a language disorder in which a person does not speak despite evidence of speech ability in the past often part of a larger neurological or psychiatric disorder lethargy irritability or malaise drooling strabismus a condition in which the eyes are not properly aligned with each other vomiting sleep disturbances emotional disturbances including fits of rage About half of all OMS cases occur in association with neuroblastoma a cancer of the sympathetic nervous system usually occurring in infants and children
Sensory integration difficulties or sensory processing disorder SPD are characterized by persistent challenges with neurological processing of sensory stimuli that interfere with a persons ability to participate in everyday life Such challenges can appear in one or several sensory systems of the somatosensory system vestibular system proprioceptive system interoceptive system auditory system visual system olfactory system and gustatory system While many people can present one or two symptoms sensory processing disorder has to have a clear functional impact on the persons life Signs of over responsivity including for example dislike of textures such as those found in fabrics foods grooming products or other materials found in daily living to which most people would not react and serious discomfort sickness or threat induced by normal sounds lights ambient temperature movements smells tastes or even inner sensations such as heartbeat Signs of under responsivity including sluggishness and lack of responsiveness Sensory cravings including for example fidgeting impulsiveness and or seeking or making loud disturbing noises and sensorimotor based problems including slow and uncoordinated movements or poor handwriting Sensory discrimination problems which might manifest themselves in behaviors such as things constantly dropped Symptoms may vary according to the disorders type and subtype present
Urethral diverticula are often asymptomatic and symptoms that are present tend to be nonspecific They can co occur with cancer in approximately 6 9 of cases most commonly adenocarcinoma but also including squamous cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma Approximately 10 of cases co occur with kidney stones There are 2 types of urethral diverticulums Congenital and acquired In infancy usually the urethral diverticulum is congenital but in rare instances acquired urethral diverticulum can be seen in infancy specially following traumatic catheterization Common symptoms of urethral diverticulum include incontinence urinary frequency and urgency pain during sex and pain during urination Other symptoms include pain localized to the urethra or pelvis and frequent urinary tract infection When urethral diverticulum becomes severe a painful mass can sometimes be felt inside the introitus of the vagina which can discharge pus If the mass is hard or bleeds complications like cancer or kidney stones may be present
Stroke symptoms typically start suddenly over seconds to minutes and in most cases do not progress further The symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected The more extensive the area of the brain affected the more functions that are likely to be lost Some forms of stroke can cause additional symptoms For example in intracranial hemorrhage the affected area may compress other structures Most forms of stroke are not associated with a headache apart from subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral venous thrombosis and occasionally intracerebral hemorrhage
Signs and symptoms of emphysematous cystitis include air in the bladder wall altered mental status severe abdominal pain weakness dark urine dysuria fever lethargy vomiting as well as white blood cells and bacteria in the urine Where some patients may be asymptomatic others may present with septic shock Symptoms can vary greatly from patient to patient which makes the disease difficult to diagnose In some cases of emphysematous cystitis patients do not even claim to have any urinary symptoms Urinary symptoms can include blood in the urine increased urinary frequency urgency occasional incontinence difficulty voiding and burning sensation Emphysematous cystitis is often indicated in patients who have air in the urine In some cases emphysematous cystitis can cause thickening of the bladder wall Clinical subcutaneous emphysema is a rare complication of emphysematous cystitis that has a poor prognosis
The main sign of a gelastic seizure is a sudden outburst of laughter with no apparent cause The laughter may sound unpleasant and sardonic rather than joyful The outburst usually lasts for less than a minute During or shortly after a seizure an individual might display some twitching strange eye movements lip smacking fidgeting or mumbling If a person who has the seizures is hooked up to an electroencephalogram it will reveal interictal epileptic discharges This syndrome usually manifests itself before the individual reaches the age of three or four The temporal lobes and the hypothalamus are the areas of the brain with the most involvement with these seizures This may cause learning disabilities and faulted cognitive function as well It is not uncommon for children to have tonic clonic seizures and atonic seizures directly following the seizure Those that are associated with hypothalamic hamartomas may occur as often as several times hourly and typically begin during infancy Seizures that occur in infancy may include bursts of cooing respirations giggling and smiling Due to early hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis activation in girls who have the seizures it is not uncommon for them to display secondary sex characteristics before the age of eight
The key symptoms visible at birth vary between individuals exposed to warfarin in utero The severity and occurrence of symptoms is dose dependent with higher doses 5 mg warfarin daily more likely to cause immediately noticeable defects The period of pregnancy in which warfarin is administered can affect the category of defects which develop Warfarin taken in the first trimester of pregnancy is more likely to result in physical abnormalities while warfarin taken in the second and third trimester more commonly causes abnormalities of the central nervous system The more extreme symptoms such as severe intellectual disability blindness and deafness occur more often when warfarin is used throughout all three trimesters
Symptoms may include fever swelling and complaints of excessive pain The initial skin changes are similar to cellulitis or abscess thus making the diagnosis at early stages difficult Hardening of the skin and soft tissue and swelling beyond the area of skin changes are commonly present in those with early necrotizing changes The redness and swelling usually blend into surrounding normal tissues The overlying skin may appear shiny and tense Other signs which are more suggestive of necrotizing changes but present in later stages in 7 to 44 of the cases are formation of bullae bleeding into the skin which is present before skin necrosis skin turning from red to purple and black due to thrombosis of blood vessels presence of gas in tissues and reduced or absent sensation over the skin due to the necrosis of the underlying nerves Rapid progression to shock despite antibiotic therapy is another indication of necrotizing fasciitis Necrotizing changes affecting the groin are known as Fournier gangrene However those who are immunocompromised have cancer use corticosteroid on radiotherapy chemotherapy HIV AIDS or prior organ or bone marrow transplantation may not show typical symptoms Immunocompromised persons also have twice the risk of death from necrotizing infections so higher suspicion should be maintained in this group
Risk factors The following risk factors have been associated with increased incidence of CRS Older age Comorbid conditions diabetes mellitus uncontrolled hypertension anemia Drugs anti inflammatory agents diuretics ACE inhibitors ARBs History of heart failure with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction Prior myocardial infarction Elevated New York Heart Association NYHA functional class Elevated cardiac troponins Chronic kidney disease reduced eGFR elevated BUN creatinine or cystatin
According to DSM 5 there are six signs of pyromania Pyromania is mainly categorized by the purposeful setting of fire tension or arousal before a fire is set interest in or attraction to fire and pleasure or relief after setting a fire These fires not set for personal gain are not meant to express anger or conceal illegal activity are not in support of sociopolitical ideologies are not in response to delusions and are not signs of intellectual disability For diagnosis the setting of fire should not be better explained by a conduct disorder manic episode or a personality disorder antisocial personality disorder ICD 11 also adds substance abuse to this list According to ICD 11 signs of fire setting may occur in response to feelings of depressed mood anxiety boredom loneliness or other negative affective states Those with pyromania exhibit problems in social environments and learning disabilities Women pyromaniacs often report histories of exposure to trauma including sexual abuse and self harm Episodic fire setting may become more intense and violent over time becoming potentially chronic if untreated
An infant with hydranencephaly may appear normal at birth or may have some distortion of the skull and upper facial features due to fluid pressure inside the skull The infants head size and spontaneous reflexes such as sucking swallowing crying and moving the arms and legs may all seem normal depending on the severity of the condition However after a few weeks the infant sometimes becomes irritable and has increased muscle tone hypertonia After several months of life seizures and hydrocephalus may develop if they did not exist at birth Other symptoms may include visual impairment lack of growth deafness blindness spastic quadriparesis paralysis and intellectual deficits Some infants may have additional abnormalities at birth including seizures myoclonus involuntary sudden rapid jerks limited thermoregulation abilities and respiratory problems Still other infants display no obvious symptoms at birth going many months without a confirmed diagnosis of hydranencephaly In some cases severe hydrocephalus or another cephalic condition is misdiagnosed
Age usually over 60 years old Sex males are more prone Site gingiva buccal mucosa alveolar mucosa hard palate floor of the mouth larynx oesophagus penis vagina scrotum Clinical presentation It is a slow growing diffuse exophytic lesion usually covered by leukoplakic patches Invasive lesions quickly invade bones It can rapidly become fixed with underlying periosteum and cause gradual destruction of jaw bone Enlarged regional lymph nodes Lesion shows painful multiple rugae like folds and deep clefts between them Regional lymph nodes tender and enlarged Pain and difficulty in mastication

People with Möbius syndrome are born with facial paralysis and the inability to move their eyes laterally Often their upper lip is retracted due to muscle shrinkage Occasionally the cranial nerves V and VIII are affected If cranial nerve VIII is affected the person experiences hearing loss Other symptoms that sometimes occur with Möbius syndrome are Limb abnormalities clubbed feet missing fingers or toes Chest wall abnormalities Poland syndrome Crossed eyes strabismus Difficulty in breathing and or in swallowing Corneal erosion resulting from difficulty in blinkingChildren with Möbius syndrome may have delayed speech because of paralysis of muscles that move the lips soft palate and tongue root However with speech therapy most people with Möbius syndrome can develop understandable speech Möbius syndrome has been associated with increased occurrence of the symptoms of autism Some children with Möbius syndrome are mistakenly labeled as intellectually disabled because of their expressionless faces strabismus and frequent drooling
Physical symptoms of CMRD involving development and function of the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system typically manifest between infancy and adolescence The symptoms of CmRD are similar to the physical symptoms of malnutrition as the disease arises due to the poor absorption of lipids and fat soluble nutrients such as vitamin E For this reason the disease is likely to be under diagnosed by physicians Fat soluble nutrients are essential for growth development and normal bodily function Vitamin E deficiency is especially serious as the vitamin is necessary for proper neurological function and development Without Vitamin E neurons cannot operate correctly and signals from the brain are weakened This leads to reduced muscle development and reduced muscle contraction Symptoms that manifest in the GI tract are likely to be a consequence of both reduced absorption of fats and physiological stress imposed on enterocytes that can not shuttle fats into circulation Additional symptoms that occur throughout the body can be attributed to the lack of sufficient lipid sources Chronic Malabsorptive Diarrhea Diarrhea that results from the poor absorption of fats Steatorrhea Abnormal stools often foul smelling due to the increased presence of undigested fats Vomiting Vitamin E Deficiency Low levels of Vitamin E due to the malabsorption of fats in the diet causes poor brain muscle and eye development Cardiomyopathy A class of disease that affects heart muscle causing shortness of breath tiredness and swelling of the legs Slowed Growth Failure to Thrive Insufficient weight gain or drastic levels of weight loss in children Hypocholesterolemia Low blood cholesterol levels Hepatic Steatosis Fatty Liver Excessive fat buildup in the liver a result of the abnormal lipid panels of CMRD patients Hyporeflexia Absent or low levels of muscle reflexes Amyotrophy Muscle tissue wasting the loss of muscle tissue
Despite the alternative name for this condition denture sore mouth it is usually painless and asymptomatic The appearance of the involved mucosa is erythematous red and edematous swollen sometimes with petechial hemorrhage pin points of bleeding This usually occurs beneath an upper denture Sometimes angular cheilitis can coexist which is inflammation of the corners of the mouth also often associated with Candida albicans Stomatitis rarely develops under a lower denture The affected mucosa is often sharply defined in the shape of the covering denture

The main sign of anodontia is when a child has not developed any of their permanent teeth by the age of 12 Another sign of anodontia can include the absence of baby teeth when the baby has reached 12 to 13 months Symptoms that are associated with anodontia include alopecia lack of sweat glands cleft lip or palate and missing fingernails Typically these symptoms are seen because anodontia is typically associated with ectodermal dysplasia In the rare case that ectodermal dysplasia is not present anodontia will be caused from an unknown genetic mutation
When cancer begins it produces no symptoms Signs and symptoms appear as the mass grows or ulcerates The findings that result depend on the cancers type and location Few symptoms are specific Many frequently occur in individuals who have other conditions Cancer can be difficult to diagnose and can be considered a great imitator People may become anxious or depressed post diagnosis The risk of suicide in people with cancer is approximately double
It is important to diagnose DE early and provide appropriate treatment to help prevent periodontal disease caries pulpal complications and malocclusion It occurs on the cingulum occlusal surface of the teeth The extra cusp can cause occlusal interference displace of the affected tooth and or opposing teeth irritates the tongue when speaking and eating and decay the developmental grooves Temporomandibular joint pain could be experienced secondarily due to occlusal trauma caused by the tubercle This cusp could be worn away or fractured easily In 70 of the cases the fine pulpal extension were exposed which can lead to infection pulpal necrosis and periapical pathosis
Metabolic alkalosis is usually accompanied by low blood potassium concentration causing e g muscular weakness muscle pain and muscle cramps from disturbed function of the skeletal muscles and muscle spasms from disturbed function of smooth muscles It may also cause low blood calcium concentration As the blood pH increases blood transport proteins such as albumin become more ionized into anions This causes the free calcium present in blood to bind more strongly with albumin If severe it may cause tetany
ADNFLE is a partial epilepsy disorder characterized by brief violent seizures during sleep Seizures are complex consisting of arm and leg movements fist clenching and vocalizations such as yelling and moaning These seizures often occur in clusters and can first manifest in childhood Diagnosis is often initially incorrectly made as nightmares night terrors parasomnias and various psychiatric disorders

The signs and symptoms of Graves disease virtually all result from the direct and indirect effects of hyperthyroidism with main exceptions being Graves ophthalmopathy goiter and pretibial myxedema which are caused by the autoimmune processes of the disease Symptoms of the resultant hyperthyroidism are mainly insomnia hand tremor hyperactivity hair loss excessive sweating oligomenorrhea itching heat intolerance weight loss despite increased appetite diarrhea frequent defecation palpitations periodic partial muscle weakness or paralysis in those especially of Asian descent and skin warmth and moistness Further signs that may be seen on physical examination are most commonly a diffusely enlarged usually symmetric nontender thyroid lid lag excessive lacrimation due to Graves ophthalmopathy arrhythmias of the heart such as sinus tachycardia atrial fibrillation and premature ventricular contractions and hypertension
There are multiple symptoms that can help this disease to be diagnosed this disease is marked by the presence of acanthocytes in blood these acanthocytes can sometimes be absent or even make a late appearance in the course of the disease and neurodegeneration causing a choreiform movement disorder Another one of them would be that this disease should be considered in patients who have elevated levels of acanthocytes in a peripheral blood film The serum creatine kinase is often elevated in the body of the people who are affected by this disease People afflicted by this disease also experience a loss of neurons Loss of neurons is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases Due to the generally non regenerative nature of neuronal cells in the adult central nervous system this results in an irreversible and fatal process of neurodegeneration There is also the presence of several movement related disorders including chorea dystonia and bradykinesia one of the more incapacitating ones includes Truncal spasms
Clinical symptoms of the disease Seborrhoeic areas This is defined as areas where excess oil and sebum is released Overall greasy or scaly skin either in the central chest and back or in the folds of the skin Fragile or poorly formed fingernails Nail disease leading to V shaped nicks at the edge of the nail Rash that covers many areas of the body The rash is often associated with a strong unpleasant odor The rash can be aggravated by heat humidity and exposure to sunlight Mucosal manifestation White cobblestone pattern of small papules Overgrowth of gums Usually affects the mouth esophagus rectum vulva vagina Oral symptoms can be diagnosed by a routine dental examination Other symptoms and their overall prevalence in the affected population In 80 to 90 of patients Acrokeratosis verruciformisAcrokeratosis is characterized by several small wart like and flat topped bumps that line the skin on typically the hand and feet Hypermelanotic macule Patches on the skin that contain excess pigment they often appear as dark patches in the skin Pruritus Itching Subungual hyperkeratotic fragments Thickened skin that is often discolored under nails on either hands or feet Palmar pits Usually red in color they are pits or depressions in the palms or soles of the hands and feet In 30 to 79 of patients Abnormal hair morphology Acne conglobata Typically described as cystic acne
Some of the fundamental components of kleptomania include recurring intrusive thoughts impotence to resist the compulsion to engage in stealing and the release of internal pressure following the act These symptoms suggest that kleptomania could be regarded as an obsessive compulsive type of disorder People diagnosed with kleptomania often have other types of disorders involving mood anxiety eating impulse control and drug use They also have great levels of stress guilt and remorse and privacy issues accompanying the act of stealing These signs are considered to either cause or intensify general comorbid disorders The characteristics of the behaviors associated with stealing could result in other problems as well which include social segregation and substance use The many types of other disorders frequently occurring along with kleptomania usually make clinical diagnosis uncertain There is a difference between ordinary theft and kleptomania ordinary theft whether planned or impulsive is deliberate and motivated by the usefulness of the object or its monetary worth whereas with kleptomania there is the recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal items even though the items are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value

Individuals that are homozygotes for Tangiers disease develop various cholesterol ester depositions These are especially visible in the tonsils as they may appear yellow orange The cholesterol esters may also be found in lymph nodes bone marrow the liver and spleen Due to the cholesterol ester depositions the tonsils may be enlarged Hepatosplenomegaly enlarged liver and spleen is common Neuropathy and cardiovascular disease are the most devastating developments caused by Tangiers disease
During the nightmare the sleeper may scream and yell out things The nightmare sufferer is often awakened by these threatening frightening dreams and can often vividly remember their experience Upon awakening the sleeper is usually alert and oriented within their surroundings but may have an increased heart rate and symptoms of anxiety like sweating They may have trouble falling back to sleep for fear they will experience another nightmare A person experiencing nightmare disorder may have trouble going through everyday tasks anxiety and lack of sleep caused by the fearful dreams may hinder the individual from completing everyday tasks efficiently and correctly Upon experiencing this these nightmare sufferers may consult with a psychiatrist The sleeper may have recurring episodes of awakening while recalling the intensely disturbing dream manifestations which usually result from fear or anxiety but can also be triggered by anger sadness disgust and other dysphoric emotions Additionally the sleeper may experience at least one of the following two features delayed return of going back to sleep after episodes and having episodes in the latter half of the sleep period
The symptoms can occur anywhere between days to months after administration of the offending medication depending on the dose and speed of administration The patient first experiences tingling and or numbness of the palms and soles This is followed 2 4 days later by bright redness which is symmetrical and sharply defined In severe cases this may be followed by burning pain and swelling blistering and ulceration peeling of the skin Healing occurs without scarring unless there has been skin ulceration or necrosis skin loss death With each subsequent cycle of chemotherapy the reaction will appear more quickly be more severe and will take longer to heal
Individuals with the condition of fungal sinusitis mostly present with features that include facial pain and pain around the eyes nasal congestion rhinorrhea running nose headache later there may be ophthalmoplegia paralysis of ocular muscles
Neurological Abnormalities of the cranial nerves are present in 50 70 percent of cases The most common abnormality is involvement of the facial nerve which may lead to reduced power on one or both sides of the face 65 percent resp 35 percent of all cranial nerve cases followed by reduction in visual perception due to optic nerve involvement Rarer symptoms are double vision oculomotor nerve trochlear nerve or abducens nerve decreased sensation of the face trigeminal nerve hearing loss or vertigo vestibulocochlear nerve swallowing problems glossopharyngeal nerve and weakness of the shoulder muscles accessory nerve or the tongue hypoglossal nerve Visual problems may also be the result of papilledema swelling of the optic disc due to obstruction by granulomas of the normal cerebrospinal fluid CSF circulation Seizures mostly of the tonic clonic grand mal type are present in about 15 percent and may be the presenting phenomenon in 10 percent Meningitis inflammation of the lining of the brain occurs in 3 26 percent of cases Symptoms may include headache and nuchal rigidity being unable to bend the head forward It may be acute or chronic Accumulation of granulomas in particular areas of the brain can lead to abnormalities in the function of that area For instance involvement of the internal capsule would lead to weakness in one or two limbs on one side of the body If the granulomas are large they can exert a mass effect and cause headache and increase the risk of seizures Obstruction of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid too can cause headaches visual symptoms as mentioned above and other features of raised intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus Involvement of the spinal cord is rare but can lead to abnormal sensation or weakness in one or more limbs or cauda equina symptoms incontinence to urine or stool decreased sensation in the buttocks
With single or prolonged exposure by inhalation the lungs may become sensitized to beryllium Berylliosis has a slow onset and progression Some people who are sensitized to beryllium may not have symptoms Continued exposure causes the development of small inflammatory nodules called granulomas Of note the authors of a 2006 study suggested that beryllium inhalation was not the only form of exposure and perhaps skin exposure was also a cause as they found that a reduction in beryllium inhalation did not result in a reduction in CBD or beryllium sensitization Granulomas are seen in other chronic diseases such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis and it can occasionally be hard to distinguish berylliosis from these disorders However granulomas of CBD will typically be non caseating i e not characterized by necrosis and therefore not exhibiting a cheese like appearance grossly Ultimately this process leads to restrictive lung disease a decrease in diffusion capacity The earliest symptoms are typically cough and shortness of breath Other symptoms include chest pain joint aches weight loss and fever Rarely one can get granulomas in other organs including the liver The onset of symptoms can range from weeks up to tens of years from the initial exposure In some individuals a single exposure to beryllium can cause berylliosis
Oedema especially in the hands and face was originally considered an important sign for a diagnosis of pre eclampsia However because oedema is a common occurrence in pregnancy its utility as a distinguishing factor in pre eclampsia is not high Pitting edema unusual swelling particularly of the hands feet or face notable by leaving an indentation when pressed on can be significant and should be reported to a health care provider In general none of the signs of pre eclampsia are specific and even convulsions in pregnancy are more likely to have causes other than eclampsia in modern practice Further a symptom such as epigastric pain may be misinterpreted as heartburn Common features of pre eclampsia which are screened for during pre natal visits include elevated blood pressure and excess protein in the urine Diagnosis depends on finding a coincidence of several pre eclamptic features the final proof being their regression within the days and weeks after delivery
People with leiomyoma can be presented as asymptomatic or having no symptoms However some people may experience severe symptoms that can interfere with daily activities Common symptoms are recurrent pain and pressure in the affected region People with uterine leiomyoma can experience pain during urination bowel movements and sexual intercourse Other symptoms are abnormal vaginal bleeding and severe menstrual cramps Nipple Areolar leiomyomas can affect one or both nipples presenting with symptoms of nipple tenderness People with leiomyomas in the scrotum generally notice a growing testicle over a span of multiple years where it can grow and become heavy to the point of discomfort Due to the painless and slow progressive growth of the tumor the time frame between recognizing the tumor and surgical removal can be anywhere from 2 to 20 years
The presentation signs symptoms of an individual with platelet storage pool deficiency is as follows Unusual bleeding after surgical procedure Anemia Decrease mean platelet volume Myelodysplasia
Dents disease often produces the following signs and symptoms Extreme thirst combined with dehydration which leads to frequent urination Nephrolithiasis kidney stones Hypercalciuria high urine calcium 300 mg d or 4 mg kg per d with normal levels blood serum calcium Aminoaciduria amino acids in urine Phosphaturia phosphate in urine Glycosuria glucose in urine Kaliuresis potassium in urine Hyperuricosuria excessive amounts of uric acid in the urine Impaired urinary acidification RicketsIn a study of 25 patients with Dents disease 9 of 15 men and one of 10 women had end stage kidney disease by the age of 47
A variety of nerve types can be subjected to neurapraxia and therefore symptoms of the injury range in degree and intensity Common symptoms of neurapraxia are disturbances in sensation weakness of muscle vasomotor and sudomotor paralysis in the region of the affected nerve or nerves and abnormal sensitivity of the nerve at the point of injury It has been observed that subjective sensory symptoms include numbness tingling and burning sensations at the site of the injury Objective sensory symptoms are generally minimal in regards to touch pain heat and cold In cases of motor neuron neurapraxia symptoms consist of flaccid paralysis of the muscles innervated by the injured nerve or nerves Symptoms are often transient and only last for a short period of time immediately following the injury However in severe cases of neurapraxia symptoms can persist for weeks or months at a time
Regardless of cause volvulus causes symptoms by two mechanisms Bowel obstruction manifested as abdominal distension and bilious vomiting Ischemia loss of blood flow to the affected portion of intestine Depending on the location of the volvulus symptoms may vary For example in patients with cecal volvulus the predominant symptoms may be those of small bowel obstruction nausea vomiting and lack of stool or flatus because the obstructing point is close to the ileocecal valve and small intestine In patients with sigmoid volvulus although abdominal pain may be present symptoms of constipation may be more prominent Volvulus causes severe pain and progressive injury to the intestinal wall with accumulation of gas and fluid in the portion of the bowel obstructed Ultimately this can result in necrosis of the affected intestinal wall acidosis and death This is known as a closed loop obstruction because there exists an isolated closed loop of bowel Acute volvulus often requires immediate surgical intervention to untwist the affected segment of bowel and possibly resect any unsalvageable portion Volvulus occurs most frequently in middle aged and elderly men Volvulus can also arise as a rare complication in persons with redundant colon a normal anatomic variation resulting in extra colonic loops Sigmoid volvulus is the most common form of volvulus of the gastrointestinal tract and is responsible for 8 of all intestinal obstructions Sigmoid volvulus is particularly common in elderly persons and constipated patients Patients experience abdominal pain distension and absolute constipation Cecal volvulus is slightly less common than sigmoid volvulus and is associated with symptoms of abdominal pain and small bowel obstruction Volvulus can also occur in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy due to smooth muscle dysfunction Gastric volvulus causes nausea vomiting and pain in the upper abdomen The Borchardt triad is a group of symptoms that help doctors to identify gastric volvulus The symptoms are intractable retching pain in the upper abdomen and inability to pass nasogastric tube into the stomach
A unilateral decrease in visual acuity is the most common symptom of toxoplasmic retinitis Under ophthalmic examination toxoplasmic chorioretinitis classically appears as a focal white retinitis with overlying moderate inflammation of the vitreous humour A unifocal area of acute onset inflammation adjacent to an old chorioretinal scar is virtually pathognomonic for toxoplasmic chorioretinitis Focal condensation of vitreous and inflammatory cells may be seen overlying the pale yellow or gray white raised lesion in the posterior pole
Infants with LPI are usually symptom free when breastfed because of the low protein concentration in human milk but develop vomiting and diarrhea after weaning The patients show failure to thrive poor appetite growth retardation enlarged liver and spleen prominent osteoporosis and osteopenia delayed bone age and spontaneous protein aversion Forced feeding of protein may lead to convulsions and coma Mental development is normal if prolonged episode of hyperammonemia can be avoided Some patients develop severe pulmonary and kidney complications High levels of plasma glutamine and glycine are observed
The most common initial symptom of wrist osteoarthritis is joint pain The pain is brought on by activity and increases when there is activity after resting Other signs and symptoms as with any joint affected by osteoarthritis include
Symptoms are typically first experienced in early childhood and can be very difficult to diagnose the rarity of Fabry disease to many clinicians sometimes leads to misdiagnoses Manifestations of the disease usually increase in number and severity as an individual ages
Patients typically become symptomatic in their 40s due to loss of central vision However tests of rod photoreceptor function i e night vision tests show dysfunction at an earlier age One of the most sensitive visual function parameters for early SFD is a prolongation of rod mediated dark adaptation High resolution structural imaging of the Bruchs membrane and of the underlying choriocapillaris the capillary plexus nourishing the outer retina also shows early alterations

Common symptoms Coughing which produces greenish or yellow sputum A high fever accompanied by sweating chills and shivering Sharp stabbing chest pains Rapid shallow often painful breathing
Pycnodysostosis causes the bones to be abnormally dense the last bones of the fingers the distal phalanges to be unusually short and delays the normal closure of the connections sutures of the skull bones in infancy so that the soft spot fontanelle on top of the head remains widely open Because of the bone denseness those with the syndrome suffer from fractures Those with the syndrome have brittle bones which easily break especially in the legs and feet Other abnormalities involve the head and face teeth collar bones skin and nails The front and back of the head are prominent Within the open sutures of the skull there may be many small bones called wormian bones The midface is less full than usual The nose is prominent The jaw can be small The palate is narrow and grooved There will be delay in fall of milk teeth The permanent teeth can also be slow to appear The permanent teeth are commonly irregular and teeth may be missing hypodontia The collar bones are often underdeveloped and malformed The nails are flat grooved and dysplastic High bone density Acro osteolysis and obtuse mandibular angle are the characteristic radiological findings of this disorder Pycnodysostosis also causes problems that may become evident with time Aside from the broken bones the distal phalanges and the collar bone can undergo slow progressive deterioration Vertebral defects may permit the spine to curve laterally resulting in scoliosis The dental problems often require orthodontic care and cavities are common Patients with PYCD are at a high risk of severe obstructive sleep apnea OSA due to upper airway obstructions OSA must be managed to prevent long term pulmonary complications Amongst infrequent complications attention should be paid to maxillofacial anomalies Snoring can be one of the presenting complaints and this needs early evaluation and management of obstructive sleep apnea if present to prevent long term pulmonary complications
The presence of a supernumerary tooth particularly when seen in young children is associated with a disturbance of the maxillary incisor region This commonly results in the impaction of the incisors during the mixed dentition stage The study debating this also considered many other factors such as the patients age number morphology growth orientation and position of the supernumerary tooth Alongside this issue the presence of an extra tooth can impede the eruption of adjacent additional or normal teeth Therefore the presence of a supernumerary tooth when found must be approached with the appropriate treatment plan incorporating the likelihood of incisal crowding In some individuals the additional teeth can erupt far from the dental arch within the maxillary sinus The extra teeth may also migrate to a different location after development In some cases supernumerary teeth can lead to the formation of cysts Crowding is also frequently seen in people with hyperdontia
Muscle dysfunction and weakness This occurs in major muscles but also may manifest as diplopia low cardiac output dysphagia and respiratory depression due to respiratory muscle weakness Mental status changes This may range from irritability to gross confusion delirium and coma White blood cell dysfunction causing worsening of infections Instability of cell membranes due to low adenosine triphosphate ATP levels This may cause rhabdomyolysis with increased serum levels of creatine phosphokinase and also hemolytic anemia Increased affinity for oxygen in the blood caused by decreased production of 2 3 bisphosphoglyceric acid
The first sign of umbilical cord prolapse is usually a sudden and severe decrease in fetal heart rate that does not immediately resolve On fetal heart tracing a linear recording of the fetal heart rate this would usually look like moderate to severe variable decelerations In overt cord prolapse the cord can be seen or felt on the vulva or vagina A majority of umbilical cord prolapse cases happen during the second stage of labor
The narrowing of coronary arteries reduces the supply of oxygen rich blood flowing to the heart which becomes more pronounced during strenuous activities during which the heart beats faster For some this causes severe symptoms while others experience no symptoms at all The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort that occurs regularly with activity after eating or at other predictable times this phenomenon is termed stable angina and is associated with narrowing of the arteries of the heart Angina also includes chest tightness heaviness pressure numbness fullness or squeezing Angina that changes in intensity character or frequency is termed unstable Unstable angina may precede myocardial infarction In adults who go to the emergency department with an unclear cause of pain about 30 have pain due to coronary artery disease Angina shortness of breath sweating nausea or vomiting and lightheadedness are signs of a heart attack or myocardial infarction and immediate emergency medical services are crucial
MEN2 can present with a sign or symptom related to a tumor or in the case of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b with characteristic musculoskeletal and or lip and or gastrointestinal findings Medullary thyroid carcinoma MTC represents the most frequent initial diagnosis Occasionally pheochromocytoma or primary hyperparathyroidism may be the initial diagnosis Pheochromocytoma occurs in 33 50 of MEN2 cases In MEN2A primary hyperparathyroidism occurs in 10 50 of cases and is usually diagnosed after the third decade of life Rarely it may present in childhood or be the sole clinical manifestation of this syndrome MEN2A associates medullary thyroid carcinoma with pheochromocytoma in about 20 50 of cases and with primary hyperparathyroidism in 5 20 of cases MEN2B associates medullary thyroid carcinoma with pheochromocytoma in 50 of cases with marfanoid habitus and with mucosal and digestive neurofibromatosis In familial isolated medullary thyroid carcinoma the other components of the disease are absent In a review of 85 patients 70 had MEN2A and 15 had MEN2B The initial manifestation of MEN2 was medullary thyroid carcinoma in 60 of patients medullary thyroid carcinoma synchronous with pheochromocytoma in 34 and pheochromocytoma alone in 6 72 had bilateral pheochromocytomas
People who have dependent personality disorder are overdependent on other people when it comes to making decisions They cannot make a decision on their own as they need constant approval from other people Consequently individuals diagnosed with DPD tend to place needs and opinions of others above their own as they do not have the confidence to trust their decisions This kind of behaviour can explain why people with DPD tend to show passive and clingy behaviour These individuals display a fear of separation and cannot stand being alone When alone they experience feelings of isolation and loneliness due to their overwhelming dependence on other people Generally people with DPD are also pessimistic they expect the worst out of situations or believe that the worst will happen They tend to be more introverted and are more sensitive to criticism and fear rejection
A perforated septum can vary in size and location and is usually found deep inside the nose It may be asymptomatic or cause a variety of signs and symptoms Small perforations can cause a whistling noise when breathing Larger perforations usually have more severe symptoms These can be a combination of crusting blood discharge difficulty breathing nasal pressure and discomfort The closer the perforation is to the nostrils the more likely it is to cause symptoms
Robinow noted the resemblance of affected patients faces to that of a fetus using the term fetal facies to describe the appearance of a small face and widely spaced eyes Clinical features also may include a short upturned nose a prominent forehead and a flat nasal bridge The upper lip may be tented exposing dental crowding tongue tie or gum hypertrophy Though the eyes do not protrude abnormalities in the lower eyelid may give that impression Surgery may be necessary if the eyes cannot close fully In addition the ears may be set low on the head or have a deformed pinna Patients suffer from dwarfism short lower arms small feet and small hands Fingers and toes may also be abnormally short and laterally or medially bent The thumb may be displaced and some patients notably in Turkey experience ectrodactyly All patients often suffer from vertebral segmentation abnormalities Those with the dominant variant have at most a single butterfly vertebra Those with the recessive form however may suffer from hemivertebrae vertebral fusion and rib anomalies Some cases resemble Jarcho Levin syndrome or spondylocostal dysostosis Genital defects characteristically seen in males include a micropenis with a normally developed scrotum and testes Sometimes testicles may be undescended or the patient may suffer from hypospadias Female genital defects may include a reduced size clitoris and underdeveloped labia minora Infrequently the labia majora may also be underdeveloped Some research has shown that females may experience vaginal atresia or haematocolpos The autosomal recessive form of the disorder tends to be much more severe Examples of differences are summarized in the following table
The onset of symptoms tends to be fairly gradual and to occur over 1 12 years Symptoms of Hashimotos encephalopathy may include Personality changes Aggression Delusional behavior Concentration and memory problems Coma Disorientation Headaches Jerks in the muscles myoclonus 65 of cases Lack of coordination ataxia 65 of cases Partial paralysis on the right side Psychosis Seizures 60 of cases Sleep abnormalities 55 of cases Speech problems transient aphasia 80 of cases Status epilepticus 20 of cases Tremors 80 of cases
The signs and symptoms additional to the development of a yellowish colour in the sclera and skin are specific to the causes of hemolysis For example if the patient has hemolytic jaundice resulting from sickle cell disease vaso occlusive phenomena like acute vaso occlusive pain and acute chest syndrome may be observed in the acute phases while in anemia neurologic deficits and various pulmonary conditions may manifest in the chronic phase Regardless of the causes laboratory confirmed elevation is predominantly seen in unconjugated bilirubin Serum bilirubin concentration rarely exceeds 4 mg dL unless the patient has concurrent liver disease
If symptoms of histoplasmosis infection occur they start within 3 to 17 days after exposure the typical time is 12 14 days Most affected individuals have clinically silent manifestations and show no apparent ill effects The acute phase of histoplasmosis is characterized by nonspecific respiratory symptoms often cough or flu like Chest X ray findings are normal in 40 70 of cases Chronic histoplasmosis cases can resemble tuberculosis disseminated histoplasmosis affects multiple organ systems and is fatal unless treated While histoplasmosis is the most common cause of mediastinitis this remains a relatively rare disease Severe infections can cause hepatosplenomegaly lymphadenopathy and adrenal enlargement Lesions often left calcification nodules as they are healed Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome causes chorioretinitis where the choroid and retina of the eyes are scarred resulting in a loss of vision not unlike macular degeneration Despite its name the relationship to Histoplasma is controversial Distinct from POHS acute ocular histoplasmosis may rarely occur in immunodeficiency
The classic clinical presentation of a hip fracture is an elderly patient who sustained a low energy fall and now has groin pain and is unable to bear weight Pain may be referred to the supracondylar knee On examination the affected extremity is often shortened and externally rotated compared to the unaffected leg
The primary feature of primary myelofibrosis is bone marrow fibrosis but it is often accompanied by
Human exposure to aerosols has been documented to give rise to a variety of adverse health effects Building occupants complain of symptoms such as sensory irritation of the eyes nose or throat neurotoxic or general health problems skin irritation nonspecific hypersensitivity reactions infectious diseases and odor and taste sensations Exposure to poor lighting conditions has led to general malaise Extrinsic allergic alveolitis has been associated with the presence of fungi and bacteria in the moist air of residential houses and commercial offices A study in 2017 correlated several inflammatory diseases of the respiration tract with objective evidence of damp caused damage in homes The WHO has classified the reported symptoms into broad categories including mucous membrane irritation eye nose and throat irritation neurotoxic effects headaches fatigue and irritability asthma and asthma like symptoms chest tightness and wheezing skin dryness and irritation gastrointestinal complaints and more Several sick occupants may report individual symptoms which do not appear to be connected The key to discovery is the increased incidence of illnesses in general with onset or exacerbation within a fairly close time frame usually within a period of weeks In most cases SBS symptoms will be relieved soon after the occupants leave the particular room or zone However there can be lingering effects of various neurotoxins which may not clear up when the occupant leaves the building In some cases particularly in sensitive individuals there can be long term health effects
Symptoms of DES fall into three broad categories cognitive emotional and behavioural Many of the symptoms can be seen as a direct result of impairment to the central executive component of working memory which is responsible for attentional control and inhibition Although many of the symptoms regularly co occur it is common to encounter patients who have several but not all symptoms The accumulated effects of the symptoms have a large impact on daily life
Common symptoms include lower back pain buttocks pain sciatic leg pain groin pain hip pain for explanation of leg groin and hip pain see referred pain urinary frequency and transient numbness prickling or tingling Pain can range from dull aching to sharp and stabbing and increases with physical activity Symptoms also worsen with prolonged or sustained positions i e sitting standing lying Bending forward stair climbing hill climbing and rising from a seated position can also provoke pain Pain can increase during menstruation in women People with severe and disabling sacroiliac joint dysfunction can develop insomnia and depression Sacral torsion that is untreated over a long period of time can cause severe Achilles tendinosis
Initial symptoms are often described as bleeding tendency and thrombocytopenia Bleeding tendency may be observed in epistaxis and purpura Other symptoms may include macrothrombocytopenia proteinuria nephropathy sensorineural hearing loss low platelet count oral lesions and cataracts The most common symptoms include macrothrombocytopenia mild sensorineural hearing loss and nephritis The symptoms and the severity of these symptoms vary between patients where most patients experience nephritis in childhood and then progress to kidney failure in adolescence In macrothrombocytopenia platelet sizes can reach to approximately 6 6 um compared to a normal platelet size of 2 5 um where 30 platelets can reach the size of an erythrocytes This large platelet size can be compared with MYH9 disorders where platelet size can vary between 4 5 um and the 6 6 um that is found in Epstein Syndrome with mutations on the R207 codon
Syringobulbia usually causes pain It may also cause a loss of sense of temperature Alveolar hypoventilation insufficient breathing a type of central hypoventilation syndrome may occur with hypercapnia excess blood CO2 stridor an unusual breathing sound and irregular breathing
Hypochondriasis is categorized as a somatic amplification disorder a disorder of perception and cognition that involves a hyper vigilance of situation of the body or mind and a tendency to react to the initial perceptions in a negative manner that is further debilitating Hypochondriasis manifests in many ways Some people have numerous intrusive thoughts and physical sensations that push them to check with family friends and physicians For example a person who has a minor cough may think that they have tuberculosis Or sounds produced by organs in the body such as those made by the intestines might be seen as a sign of a very serious illness to patients dealing with hypochondriasis Other people are so afraid of any reminder of illness that they will avoid medical professionals for a seemingly minor problem sometimes to the point of becoming neglectful of their health when a serious condition may exist and go undiagnosed Yet others live in despair and depression certain that they have a life threatening disease and no physician can help them Some consider the disease as a punishment for past misdeeds Hypochondriasis is often accompanied by other psychological disorders Bipolar disorder clinical depression obsessive compulsive disorder OCD phobias and somatization disorder panic disorder are the most common accompanying conditions in people with hypochondriasis as well as a generalized anxiety disorder diagnosis at some point in their life Many people with hypochondriasis experience a cycle of intrusive thoughts followed by compulsive checking which is very similar to the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder However while people with hypochondriasis are afraid of having an illness patients with OCD worry about getting an illness or of transmitting an illness to others Although some people might have both these are distinct conditions Patients with hypochondriasis often are not aware that depression and anxiety produce their own physical symptoms and mistake these symptoms for manifestations of another mental or physical disorder or disease For example people with depression often experience changes in appetite and weight fluctuation fatigue decreased interest in sex and motivation in life overall Intense anxiety is associated with rapid heartbeat palpitations sweating muscle tension stomach discomfort dizziness shortness of breath and numbness or tingling in certain parts of the body hands forehead etc If a person is ill with a medical disease such as diabetes or arthritis there will often be psychological consequences such as depression Some even report being suicidal In the same way someone with psychological issues such as depression or anxiety will sometimes experience physical manifestations of these affective fluctuations often in the form of medically unexplained symptoms Common symptoms include headaches abdominal back joint rectal or urinary pain nausea fever and or night sweats itching diarrhea dizziness or balance problems Many people with hypochondriasis accompanied by medically unexplained symptoms feel they are not understood by their physicians and are frustrated by their doctors repeated failure to provide symptom relief
Tay Sachs disease is typically first noticed in infants around 6 months old displaying an abnormally strong response to sudden noises or other stimuli known as the startle response There may also be listlessness or muscle stiffness hypertonia The disease is classified into several forms which are differentiated based on the onset age of neurological symptoms
The classic triad for congenital rubella syndrome is Sensorineural deafness 58 of patients Eye abnormalities especially retinopathy cataract glaucoma and microphthalmia 43 of patients Congenital heart disease especially pulmonary artery stenosis and patent ductus arteriosus 50 of patients Other manifestations of CRS may include
Small red erosions on the glans first sign Redness of the foreskin Redness of the penis Other rashes on the head of the penis Foul smelling discharge Painful foreskin and penis
Symptoms depend on the regions of the brain involved Prior to its onset patients may present with the neurological signs and symptoms of hyponatraemic encephalopathy such as nausea and vomiting confusion headache and seizures These symptoms may resolve with normalisation of the serum sodium concentration Three to five days later a second phase of neurological manifestations occurs correlating with the onset of myelinolysis Observable immediate precursors may include seizures disturbed consciousness gait changes and decrease or cessation of respiratory function The classical clinical presentation is the progressive development of spastic quadriparesis pseudobulbar palsy and emotional lability pseudobulbar affect with other more variable neurological features associated with brainstem damage These result from a rapid myelinolysis of the corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts in the brainstem In about ten per cent of people with central pontine myelinolysis extrapontine myelinolysis is also found In these cases symptoms of Parkinsons disease may be generated
Genital disease Women Chlamydial infection of the cervix neck of the womb is a sexually transmitted infection which has no symptoms for around 70 of women infected The infection can be passed through vaginal anal or oral sex Of those who have an asymptomatic infection that is not detected by their doctor approximately half will develop pelvic inflammatory disease PID a generic term for infection of the uterus fallopian tubes and or ovaries PID can cause scarring inside the reproductive organs which can later cause serious complications including chronic pelvic pain difficulty becoming pregnant ectopic tubal pregnancy and other dangerous complications of pregnancy Chlamydia is known as the silent epidemic as at least 70 of genital C trachomatis infections in women and 50 in men are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis and can linger for months or years before being discovered Signs and symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge abdominal pain painful sexual intercourse fever painful urination or the urge to urinate more often than usual urinary urgency For sexually active women who are not pregnant screening is recommended in those under 25 and others at risk of infection Risk factors include a history of chlamydial or other sexually transmitted infection new or multiple sexual partners and inconsistent condom use Guidelines recommend all women attending for emergency contraceptive are offered chlamydia testing with studies showing up to 9 of women aged 25 years had chlamydia
Children with developmental regression lose developmental milestones they have previously gained These can be motor social or language skills The loss of motor skills could include loss of the ability to purposefully use hands loss of the ability to feed oneself loss of the ability to walk loss of the ability to bathe oneself and loss of the ability to dress oneself The loss of social skills could include loss of the ability desire to play loss of the ability to make appropriate eye contact and loss of interest in playing social games The loss of language skills could include the loss of a childs ability to understand spoken speech and sounds receptive language skills and or the loss of a childs ability to use words spoken language expressive language skills
Children In children septic arthritis usually affects the larger joints like the hips knees and shoulders The early signs and symptoms of septic arthritis in children and adolescence can be confused with limb injury Among the signs and symptoms of septic arthritis are acutely swollen red painful joint with fever Kocher criteria have been suggested to predict the diagnosis of septic arthritis in children Importantly observation of active limb motion or kicking in the lower limb can provide valuable clues to septic arthritis of hip or knee In neonates new born and infants the hip joint is characteristically held in abduction flexion and external rotation This position helps the infant accommodate maximum amount of septic joint fluid with the least tension possible The tendency to have multiple joint involvements in septic arthritis of neonates and young children should be closely considered
Spastic quadriplegia can be detected by the abnormal development of motor skills in children Symptoms can present themselves as early as three months but are generally seen before the child reaches two years of age Some warning signs include a child of more than two months who has stiff legs that scissor and is unable to control his or her head and a child of more than twelve months who has not developed the ability to crawl or stand Spastic quadriplegia also presents a range of symptoms that affect the musculature Many experience contractures which are defined as joints that cannot be stretched or moved Clonus is another symptom that is characterized by alternating rapid muscle contraction and relaxation This presents itself as tremors and scissoring of the limbs Distonia or lasting muscle contractions and tightness is also often experienced by those affected by spastic quadriplegia These involuntary muscle contractions may affect the development of structural muscle around the hip and lead to hip dysplasia and dislocation making it difficult to sit The combination of these symptoms often makes it difficult for the patients to walk as well Although the arms and legs of patients are often stiff the neck is usually limp due to the lack of voluntary muscle control
Waterhouse Friderichsen syndrome can be caused by a number of different organisms see below When caused by Neisseria meningitidis WFS is considered the most severe form of meningococcal sepsis The onset of the illness is nonspecific with fever rigors vomiting and headache Soon a rash appears first macular not much different from the rose spots of typhoid and rapidly becoming petechial and purpuric with a dusky gray color Low blood pressure hypotension develops and rapidly leads to septic shock The cyanosis of extremities can be extreme and the patient is very prostrated or comatose In this form of meningococcal disease meningitis generally does not occur Low levels of blood glucose and sodium high levels of potassium in the blood and the ACTH stimulation test demonstrate the acute adrenal failure Leukocytosis need not be extreme and in fact leukopenia may be seen and it is a very poor prognostic sign C reactive protein levels can be elevated or almost normal Thrombocytopenia is sometimes extreme with alteration in prothrombin time PT and partial thromboplastin time PTT suggestive of disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC Acidosis and acute kidney failure can be seen as in any severe sepsis Meningococci can be readily cultured from blood or cerebrospinal fluid and can sometimes be seen in smears of cutaneous lesions Difficulty swallowing atrophy of the tongue and cracks at the corners of the mouth are also characteristic features
Selenium deficiency in combination with Coxsackievirus infection can lead to Keshan disease which is potentially fatal Selenium deficiency also contributes along with iodine deficiency to Kashin Beck disease The primary symptom of Keshan disease is myocardial necrosis leading to weakening of the heart Kashin Beck disease results in atrophy degeneration and necrosis of cartilage tissue Keshan disease also makes the body more susceptible to illness caused by other nutritional biochemical or infectious diseases Selenium is also necessary for the conversion of the thyroid hormone thyroxine T4 into its more active counterpart triiodothyronine T3 and as such a deficiency can cause symptoms of hypothyroidism including extreme fatigue mental slowing goiter cretinism and recurrent miscarriage
The clinical presentation is variable but includes developmental and growth delay athletic muscular built skeletal anomalies joint stiffness characteristic facial appearance deafness variable cognitive deficits tracheal stenosis aortic stenosis pyloric stenosisThe facial abnormalities include
Symptoms of Da Costas syndrome include fatigue upon exertion weakness induced by minor activity shortness of breath palpitations sweating and chest pain
The most common cause of blindness in developing countries is Vitamin A deficiency The WHO estimated in 1995 that 13 8 million children had some degree of visual loss related to VAD Night blindness and its worsened condition xerophthalmia are markers of Vitamin A deficiency collections of keratin in the conjunctiva known as Bitots spots and ulceration and necrosis of cornea keratomalacia can be seen Conjunctival epithelial defects occur around lateral aspect of the limbus in the subclinical stage of VAD These conjunctival epithelial defects are not visible on a biomicroscope but they take up black stain and become readily visible after instillation of kajal surma this is called Imtiazs sign
Clinical symptoms of RED S may include disordered eating fatigue hair loss cold hands and feet dry skin noticeable weight loss increased healing time from injuries e g lingering bruises increased incidence of bone fracture and cessation of menses Affected athletes may also struggle with low self esteem and depression Upon physical examination a physician may also note the following symptoms elevated carotene in the blood anemia orthostatic hypotension electrolyte irregularities hypoestrogenism vaginal atrophy and bradycardia An athlete may show signs of restrictive eating but not meet the clinical criteria for an eating disorder They may also display subtle menstrual disturbances such as a change in menstrual cycle length anovulation or luteal phase defects but not yet have developed complete amenorrhea Likewise an athletes bone density may decrease but may not yet have dropped below her age matched normal range These signs can be considered occult as no one symptom may be severe enough to seek medical attention leaving the triad to go unnoticed or untreated
Children with DMDD show severe and recurrent temper outbursts three or more times per week These outbursts can be verbal or behavioral Verbal outbursts often are described by observers as rages fits or tantrums Children may scream yell and cry for excessively long periods of time sometimes with little provocation Physical outbursts may be directed toward people or property Children may throw objects hit slap or bite others destroy toys or furniture or otherwise act in a harmful or destructive manner Children with DMDD also display persistently irritable or angry mood that is observable by others Parents teachers and classmates describe these children as habitually angry touchy grouchy or easily set off Unlike the irritability that can be a symptom of other childhood disorders such as ODD anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder the irritability displayed by children with DMDD is not episodic or situation dependent In DMDD the irritability or anger is severe and is shown most of the day nearly every day in multiple settings lasting for one or more years
Nipple adenomas may be felt as a lump under the nipple or areola They may come to attention because of nipple pain ulceration swelling or discharge
The presentation of argininemia in those that are affected is consistent with the following
Cough shortness of breath chest pain and fever are seen when the lungs are infected appearing like a pneumonia There may also be feeling of tiredness When the brain is infected symptoms include headache fever neck pain nausea and vomiting light sensitivity confusion or changes in behaviour It can also affect other parts of the body including skin eyes bones and prostate In the skin it may appear as several fluid filled nodules with dead tissue Depending on the site of infection other features may include loss of vision blurred vision inability to move an eye and memory loss Symptom onset is often sudden when lungs are infected and gradual over several weeks when the central nervous system is affected
The signs and symptoms of dementia are termed as the neuropsychiatric symptoms also known as the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia Behavioral symptoms can include agitation restlessness inappropriate behavior sexual disinhibition and aggression which can be verbal or physical These symptoms may result from impairments in cognitive inhibition Psychological symptoms can include depression psychotic hallucinations and delusions apathy and anxiety The most commonly affected areas include memory visuospatial function affecting perception and orientation language attention and problem solving The rate at which symptoms progress occurs on a continuum over several stages and they vary across the dementia subtypes Most types of dementia are slowly progressive with some deterioration of the brain well established before signs of the disorder become apparent Often there are other conditions present such as high blood pressure or diabetes and there can sometimes be as many as four of these comorbidities People with dementia are also more likely to have problems with incontinence they are three times more likely to have urinary and four times more likely to have fecal incontinence compared to people of similar ages Dementia symptoms can vary widely from person to person It affects memory attention span communication reasoning judgement problem solving and visual perception etc Signs that may point to dementia include getting lost in a familiar neighborhood using unusual words to refer to familiar objects forgetting the name of a close family member or friend forgetting old memories not being able to complete tasks independently etc
It is characterized by the presence of an oculomotor nerve CN III palsy and cerebellar ataxia including tremor and involuntary choreoathetotic movements Neuroanatomical structures affected include the oculomotor nucleus red nucleus corticospinal tracts and superior cerebellar peduncle decussation It has a similar cause morphology signs and symptoms to Webers syndrome the main difference between the two being that Webers is more associated with hemiplegia i e paralysis and Benedikts with hemiataxia i e disturbed coordination of movements It is also similar to Claudes syndrome but is distinguishable in that Benedikts has more predominant tremor and choreoathetotic movements while Claudes is more marked by the ataxia
The dry scaling appearance is most noticeable during the winter as a result of dry air inside peoples homes During the summer tanning of the surrounding normal skin makes the pale patches of pityriasis alba more prominent Individual lesions develop through 3 stages and sometimes are itchy
Angina pectoris can be quite painful but many patients with angina complain of chest discomfort rather than actual pain the discomfort is usually described as a pressure heaviness tightness squeezing burning or choking sensation Apart from chest discomfort anginal pains may also be experienced in the epigastrium upper central abdomen back neck area jaw or shoulders This is explained by the concept of referred pain and is because the spinal level that receives visceral sensation from the heart simultaneously receives cutaneous sensation from parts of the skin specified by that spinal nerves dermatome without an ability to discriminate the two Typical locations for referred pain are arms often inner left arm shoulders and neck into the jaw Angina is typically precipitated by exertion or emotional stress It is exacerbated by having a full stomach and by cold temperatures Pain may be accompanied by breathlessness sweating and nausea in some cases In this case the pulse rate and the blood pressure increases Chest pain lasting only a few seconds is normally not angina such as precordial catch syndrome Myocardial ischemia comes about when the myocardium the heart muscle receives insufficient blood and oxygen to function normally either because of increased oxygen demand by the myocardium or because of decreased supply to the myocardium This inadequate perfusion of blood and the resulting reduced delivery of oxygen and nutrients are directly correlated to blocked or narrowed blood vessels Some experience autonomic symptoms related to increased activity of the autonomic nervous system such as nausea vomiting and pallor Major risk factors for angina include cigarette smoking diabetes high cholesterol high blood pressure sedentary lifestyle and family history of premature heart disease A variant form of angina Prinzmetals angina occurs in patients with normal coronary arteries or insignificant atherosclerosis It is believed caused by spasms of the artery It occurs more in younger women Coital angina also known as angina damour is angina subsequent to sexual intercourse It is generally rare except in patients with severe coronary artery disease
It is a congenital subluxation or dislocation of the ulnas distal end due to malformation of the bones Sometimes minor abnormalities of other bone structures often caused by disease or injury such as a fracture of the distal end of the radius with upward displacement of the distal fragment The deformity varies in degree from a slight protrusion of the lower end of the ulna to complete dislocation of the inferior radio ulnar joint with marked ulnar deviation of the hand Severe deformities are associated with congenital absence or hypoplasia of the radius The male female rate of this disorder is 1 4 The incidence is unknown and there is no described racial predominance Even though Madelungs Deformity is considered a congenital disorder symptoms sometimes arent seen until adulthood In most cases symptoms find their onset during midchildhood At this age the relatively slower growth of the ulnar and palmar part of the radius leads to an increasingly progressive deformity Pain and deformity are the main symptoms patients present with Typical clinical presentation consists of a short forearm anterior ulnar bow of the radius and a forward subluxation of the hand on the forearm As mentioned before the severity of the disorder varies greatly which also leads to a spectrum of presentation
Left atrial enlargement can be mild moderate or severe depending on the extent of the underlying condition Although other factors may contribute left atrium size has been found to be a predictor of mortality due to both cardiovascular issues as well as all cause mortality Research suggests that left atrium size as measured by an echo cardiograph may be linked to cardiovascular disease However studies that have found LAE to be a predictor for mortality recognize the need for more standardized left atrium measurements than those found in an echo cardiogram
General symptoms of a person in a comatose state are
While most carcinoids are asymptomatic through the natural life and are discovered only upon surgery for unrelated reasons so called coincidental carcinoids all carcinoids are considered to have malignant potential About 10 of carcinoids secrete excessive levels of a range of hormones most notably serotonin 5 HT causing
Anal fistulae can present with the following symptoms skin maceration pus serous fluid and or rarely feces discharge can be bloody or purulent pruritus ani itching depending on presence and severity of infection pain swelling tenderness fever unpleasant odorThick discharge which keeps the area wet
These are protrusions of disc material into the surface of the vertebral body which may contact the marrow of the vertebra and lead to inflammation The protrusions are also associated with necrosis of the vertebral bone and the question of whether these protrusions and inflammation cause the necrosis or whether the cartilage migrates into areas that have become necrotic due to other conditions is under investigation They may or may not be symptomatic and their link to back pain is controversial Williams and colleagues note that this relationship may be due to lumbar disc disease as the two commonly occur simultaneously
Teratomas may be found in babies children and adults Teratomas of embryonal origin are most often found in babies at birth in young children and since the advent of ultrasound imaging in fetuses The most diagnosed fetal teratomas are sacrococcygeal teratoma Altman types I II and III and cervical neck teratoma Because these teratomas project from the fetal body into the surrounding amniotic fluid they can be seen during routine prenatal ultrasound exams Teratomas within the fetal body are less easily seen with ultrasound for these MRI of the pregnant uterus is more informative
The symptoms of a subdural hematoma have a slower onset than those of epidural hematomas because the lower pressure veins involved bleed more slowly than arteries Signs and symptoms of acute hematomas may appear in minutes if not immediately but can also be delayed as much as two weeks Symptoms of chronic subdural hematomas are usually delayed more than three weeks after Injury If the bleeds are large enough to put pressure on the brain signs of increased intracranial pressure or brain damage will be present Other symptoms of subdural hematoma can include any combination of the following
Signs and symptoms of frontal lobe seizures may include Head and eye movements to one side Complete or partial unresponsiveness or difficulty speaking Explosive screams including profanities or laughter Abnormal body posturing especially fencing position Repetitive movements such as rocking bicycle pedaling or pelvic thrustingEpileptic symptoms are frequently the product of the spread of overactivation occurring within one central foci that travels to lateral brain regions thereby causing an array of symptoms Due to the massive amount of diversity in both the cognitive and motor functions that occur within the frontal lobes there is an immense variety in the types of symptoms that can arise from epileptic seizures based on the side and topography of the focal origin In general these symptoms can range anywhere from asymmetric and abnormal body positioning to repetitive vocal outbursts and repetitive jerking movements The symptoms typically come in short bursts that last less than a minute and often occur while a patient is sleeping In most cases a patient will experience a physical or emotional Aura of tingling numbness or tension prior to a seizure occurring Fear is associated with temporal and frontal lobe epilepsies but in FLE the fear is predominantly expressed on the persons face whereas in TLE the fear is subjective and internal not perceptible to the observer Tonic posture and clonic movements are common symptoms among most of the areas of the frontal lobe therefore the type of seizures associated with frontal lobe epilepsy are commonly called tonic clonic seizures Dystonic motor movements are common to both TLE and FLE but are usually the first symptom in FLE episodes where they are quite brief and do not affect consciousness The seizures are complex partial simple partial secondarily generalized or a combination of the three These partial seizures are often misdiagnosed as psychogenic seizures
Symptoms vary greatly between individuals with type 4 hemochromatosis This difference in symptoms is likely due to the different types of SLC40A1 mutations patients may have In general signs and symptoms of type 4 hemochromatosis are caused by excess iron in cells which leads to tissue damage The damage is largely due to iron catalyzed oxidative reactions Iron can exchange electrons with a variety of substrates which can lead to generation of reactive oxygen species This can lead to oxidative stress lipid peroxidation and DNA damage which may result in cell death Two main forms of hemochromatosis type 4 exist A and B and the symptoms of these forms are distinct from one another Type 4A hemochromatosis typically has milder symptoms than other types of hemochromatosis Individuals with type 4A hemochromatosis tend to have hyperferritinemia elevated ferritin in the blood plasma and low saturated transferrin levels These individuals are likely to have liver and spleen iron overload primarily in Kupffer cells and other macrophages Because iron export is impaired iron is unavailable for transport by circulating transferrin This iron unavailability potentially leads to mild anemia in type 4A hemochromatosis patients because iron is necessary for hemoglobin synthesis and red blood cells have a relatively high turnover rate Over time iron stores increase and individuals with type 4A hemochromatosis may develop hepatic fibrosis The symptoms of type 4B hemochromatosis tend to be more severe They resemble the symptoms of hemochromatosis types 1 2 and 3 Plasma iron concentration is elevated and symptoms include joint pain diabetes and arrhythmia Liver iron deposition tends to be greater in type 4B than in type 4A Liver damage occurs more frequently in this form of hemochromatosis than in type 4A and some individuals develop cirrhosis of the liver
PLF usually induces one or all the following pathological states aural fullness fluctuating or non fluctuating hearing loss tinnitus and dizziness which may sometimes include vertigo and balance disorders
Arthralgia Arthritis Fever Diarrhea Abdominal Pain Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca Dry eyes Pleurisy Idiopathic Pericarditis Xerostomia Dry mouth Erythematous Plaques Dermatitis
Usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals but the symptoms of balantidiasis include Intermittent diarrhea Constipation Vomiting Abdominal pain Anorexia Weight loss Headache Colitis Marked fluid lossThe most common ones are intermittent diarrhea and constipation or inflammation of the colon combined with abdominal cramps and bloody stools
Although many pregnant women with high blood pressure have healthy babies without serious problems high blood pressure can be dangerous for both the mother and baby Women with pre existing or chronic high blood pressure are more likely to have certain complications during pregnancy than those with normal blood pressure However some women develop high blood pressure while they are pregnant often called gestational hypertension Chronic poorly controlled high blood pressure before and during pregnancy puts a pregnant woman and her baby at risk for problems It is associated with an increased risk for maternal complications such as preeclampsia placental abruption when the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus and gestational diabetes These women also face a higher risk for poor birth outcomes such as preterm delivery having an infant small for his her gestational age and infant death
There are no signs during pregnancy About sixty percent of infants with gastroschisis are born prematurely At birth the baby will have a relatively small 4 cm hole in the abdominal wall usually just to the right of the belly button Some of the intestines are usually outside the body passing through this opening In rare circumstances the liver and stomach may also come through the abdominal wall After birth these organs are directly exposed to air
When vomiting is severe it may result in the following Loss of 5 or more of pre pregnancy body weight Dehydration causing ketosis and constipation Nutritional disorders such as vitamin B1 thiamine deficiency vitamin B6 pyridoxine deficiency or vitamin B12 cobalamin deficiency Metabolic imbalances such as metabolic ketoacidosis or thyrotoxicosis Physical and emotional stress Difficulty with activities of daily livingSymptoms can be aggravated by hunger fatigue prenatal vitamins especially those containing iron and diet Many women with HG are extremely sensitive to odors in their environment certain smells may exacerbate symptoms Excessive salivation also known as sialorrhea gravidarum is another symptom experienced by some women Hyperemesis gravidarum tends to occur in the first trimester of pregnancy and lasts significantly longer than morning sickness While most women will experience near complete relief of morning sickness symptoms near the beginning of their second trimester some people with HG will experience severe symptoms until they give birth to their baby and sometimes even after giving birth A small percentage rarely vomit but the nausea still causes most if not all of the same issues that hyperemesis with vomiting does
Corpus luteum cysts are a normal part of the menstrual cycle They can however grow to almost 10 cm 4 inches in diameter and have the potential to bleed into themselves or twist the ovary causing pelvic or abdominal pain It is possible the cyst may rupture causing internal bleeding and pain This pain typically disappears within a few days of the rupture If the corpus luteum becomes large it may cause ovarian torsion where the ovary twists and blood flow is cut off Ovarian torsion is rare and is accompanied by severe pain
Small tumors e g 2 0 cm usually are incidental findings at autopsy without having caused symptoms Larger tumors may cause symptoms depending on the size and location Focal seizures may be caused by meningiomata that overlie the cerebrum Progressive spastic weakness in legs and incontinence may be caused by tumors that overlie the parasagittal frontoparietal region Tumors of the Sylvian aqueduct may cause myriad motor sensory aphasic and seizure symptoms depending on the location Increased intracranial pressure eventually occurs but is less frequent than in gliomas Diplopia Double vision or uneven pupil size may be symptoms if related pressure causes a third and or sixth nerve palsy
Most stings occur during the summer wet season in October May in North Queensland with different seasonal patterns elsewhere Because the jellyfish are very small the venom is only injected through the tips of the nematocysts the cnidocysts rather than the entire lengths as a result the sting may barely be noticed at first It has been described as feeling like little more than a mosquito bite The symptoms however gradually become apparent and then more and more intense in the subsequent 5 to 120 minutes 30 minutes on average Irukandji syndrome includes an array of systemic symptoms including severe headache backache muscle pains chest and abdominal pain nausea and vomiting sweating anxiety hypertension tachycardia and pulmonary edema Symptoms generally improve in four to 30 hours but may take up to two weeks to resolve completely
The patients were all diagnosed at middle age The symptoms were slowly and steadily progressive Telangiectasias developed over the face trunk and arms Increased serum erythropoietin levels eventually exceeding 5000 mU ml preceded the intrapulmonary shunting and the development of hypoxemia Sampling of the perinephric fluid revealed a clear serous fluid with low levels of protein few leukocytes and no cholesterol or triglycerides A monoclonal gammopathy was implicated in all patients tested Spontaneous venous thromboses occurred in some patients sometimes accompanied with spontaneous intracranial bleeding in the absence of blood vessels malformations
The most common symptom of eosinophilic bronchitis is a chronic dry cough lasting more than 6 8 weeks Eosinophilic bronchitis is also defined by the increased number of eosinophils a type of white blood cell in the sputum compared to that of healthy people As patients with asthma usually present with eosinophils in the sputum as well some literature distinguish the two by classifying the condition as non asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis NAEB versus eosinophilic bronchitis in asthma Non asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis is different from asthma in that it does not have airflow obstruction or airway hyperresponsiveness Along with eosinophils the number of mast cells another type of white blood cell is also significantly increased in the bronchial wash fluid of eosinophilic bronchitis patients compared to asthmatic patients and other healthy people Asthmatic patients however have greater number of mast cells that go into the smooth muscle of the airway distinguishing it from non asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis The increased number of mast cells in the smooth muscle correlate with the increased hyperresponsiveness of the airway seen in asthma patients and the difference in the mast cell infiltration of the smooth muscle may explain why eosinophilic bronchitis patients do not have airway hyperresponsiveness Eosinophilic bronchitis has also been linked to other conditions such as COPD atopic cough and allergic rhinitis
The condition consists of atresia affecting the pulmonary valve and a hypoplastic right ventricular outflow tract The ventricular septal defect doesnt impede the in and outflowing of blood in the ventricular septum which helps it form during fetal life The spectrum of symptoms exhibited by children with this condition depends on the severity of the condition while some barely show symptoms others might develop complications such as congestive heart failure In symptomatic children symptoms become apparent soon after birth these usually consist of the following Cyanosis Breathing difficulties Feeding difficulties Exhaustion while being fed Heart murmur Excessive daytime sleepiness Sticky skinOther features can occur alongside this birth defect including other congenital anomalies such as polydactyly microcephaly congenital hearing loss sensorineural type renal agenesis dextrocardia etc The condition has been called a severe form of Tetralogy of Fallot If deformed blood vessels coming from the thoracic aorta appear alongside this condition the phenotype is renamed to pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and major aortopulmonary collaterals
Acute infection with hepatitis B virus is associated with acute viral hepatitis an illness that begins with general ill health loss of appetite nausea vomiting body aches mild fever and dark urine and then progresses to development of jaundice The illness lasts for a few weeks and then gradually improves in most affected people A few people may have a more severe form of liver disease known as fulminant hepatic failure and may die as a result The infection may be entirely asymptomatic and may go unrecognized Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus may be asymptomatic or may be associated with chronic inflammation of the liver chronic hepatitis leading to cirrhosis over a period of several years This type of infection dramatically increases the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC liver cancer Across Europe hepatitis B and C cause approximately 50 of hepatocellular carcinomas Chronic carriers are encouraged to avoid consuming alcohol as it increases their risk for cirrhosis and liver cancer Hepatitis B virus has been linked to the development of membranous glomerulonephritis MGN Symptoms outside of the liver are present in 1 10 of HBV infected people and include serum sickness like syndrome acute necrotizing vasculitis polyarteritis nodosa membranous glomerulonephritis and papular acrodermatitis of childhood Gianotti Crosti syndrome The serum sickness like syndrome occurs in the setting of acute hepatitis B often preceding the onset of jaundice The clinical features are fever skin rash and polyarteritis The symptoms often subside shortly after the onset of jaundice but can persist throughout the duration of acute hepatitis B About 30 50 of people with acute necrotizing vasculitis polyarteritis nodosa are HBV carriers HBV associated nephropathy has been described in adults but is more common in children Membranous glomerulonephritis is the most common form Other immune mediated hematological disorders such as essential mixed cryoglobulinemia and aplastic anemia have been described as part of the extrahepatic manifestations of HBV infection but their association is not as well defined therefore they probably should not be considered etiologically linked to HBV
About 80 of pleural SFTs originate in the visceral pleura while 20 arise from parietal pleura Although they are often very large tumors up to 40 cm in diameter over half are asymptomatic at diagnosis While some researchers have proposed that a SFT occupying at least 40 of the affected hemithorax be considered a giant solitary fibrous tumor no such giant variant has yet been recognized within the most widely used pleural tumor classification scheme Some SFTs are associated with the paraneoplastic Doege Potter syndrome which is caused by tumor production of IGF 2
In gynecomastia there is typically enlargement of one or both breasts symmetrically or asymmetrically in a man A soft compressible and mobile mass of breast tissue is felt under the nipple and its surrounding skin in contrast to softer fatty tissue which is not associated with a mass It may also be accompanied by breast tenderness or nipple sensitivity which is commonly associated with gynecomastia observed in adolescents typically early in development Gynecomastia that is painful bothersome rapidly growing associated with masses in other areas of the body or persistent should be evaluated by a clinician for potential causes Dimpling of the skin nipple discharge and nipple retraction are not typical features of gynecomastia and may be associated with other disorders Milky discharge from the nipple is not a typical finding but may be seen in a gynecomastic individual with a prolactin secreting tumor An increase in the diameter of the areola and asymmetry of the chest are other possible signs of gynecomastia Gynecomastia has psychosocial implications that may be particularly challenging for adolescents who are experiencing physical maturation and self identity formation which includes body image disturbances negative attitudes towards eating self esteem problems social withdrawal anxiety and shame Men with gynecomastia may appear anxious or stressed due to concerns about its appearance and the possibility of having breast cancer
It has possibly the earliest onset compared to all other schizophrenias considered to begin in some within childhood Symptoms of schizophrenia simplex include an absence of will impoverished thinking and flattening of affect There is a gradual deterioration of functioning with increased amotivation and reduced socialization It is considered to be rarely diagnosed and is a schizophrenia without psychotic symptoms In a study of patients in a Massachusetts hospital persons with simple schizophrenia were found to make attempts at reality fulfillment with respect to the more primitive needs tending toward the achievement of fulfillment of these needs rather than engaging in fantasy as is typically found as a reaction to environmental stimuli by the psychotic person
Symptoms may begin quickly or slowly depending on the size of the embolus and how much it blocks the blood flow Symptoms of embolisation in an organ vary with the organ involved but commonly include
The disorder causes muscle weakness atrophy and muscle spasms throughout the body due to the degeneration of the upper motor and lower motor neurons Individuals affected by the disorder may ultimately lose the ability to initiate and control all voluntary movement although bladder and bowel function and the extraocular muscles the muscles responsible for eye movement are usually spared until the final stages of the disease Cognitive or behavioral dysfunction is present in 30 50 of individuals with ALS Around half of people with ALS will experience mild changes in cognition and behavior and 10 15 will show signs of frontotemporal dementia FTD Most people with ALS who have normal cognition at the time of diagnosis have preserved cognition throughout the course of their disease the development of cognitive impairment in those with normal cognition at baseline is associated with a worse prognosis Repeating phrases or gestures apathy and loss of inhibition are frequently reported behavioral features of ALS Language dysfunction executive dysfunction and troubles with social cognition and verbal memory are the most commonly reported cognitive symptoms in ALS a meta analysis found no relationship between dysfunction and disease severity However cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions have been found to correlate with reduced survival in people with ALS and increased caregiver burden this may be due in part to deficits in social cognition About half the people who have ALS experience emotional lability in which they cry or laugh for no reason it is more common in those with bulbar onset ALS Pain is a symptom experienced by most people with ALS and can take the form of neuropathic pain pain caused by nerve damage spasticity muscle cramps and nociceptive pain caused by reduced mobility and muscle weakness examples of nociceptive pain in ALS include contractures permanent shortening of a muscle or joint neck pain back pain shoulder pain and pressure ulcers Sensory nerves and the autonomic nervous system are generally unaffected meaning the majority of people with ALS maintain hearing sight touch smell and taste
Latah can affect people differently someone can have a very strong reaction or a slight reaction during a latah episode Every instance of latah has been acquired over time Those who are affected which by an overwhelming number are middle aged to older women are not born latah It typically occurs around the time of menopause There is a lack of latah in the higher social strata of Malay and Java which suggests they are more likely to suppress their responses than those who belong to lower social classes A latah episode occurs after being startled poking shouting something falling During an episode a latah person will begin to shout obscenities imitate words or gestures of those around them or even those on TV and will often obey any commands given to them no matter how outrageous or against cultural norms they are Persons with latah make movements reminiscent of behaviors normally peculiar to certain childhood developmental stages The person is unlikely to remember anything occurring during the episode
Stress ulcers as defined by overt bleeding and hemodynamic instability decreased hemoglobin and or need for transfusion were seen in 1 5 of patients in the 2252 patients in the Canadian Critical Care Trials group study People with stress ulcers have a longer ICU length of stay up to 8 days and a higher mortality up to 4 fold than patients who do not have stress ulceration and bleeding While the bleeding and transfusions associated with the stress ulcerations contribute to the increased mortality the contribution of factors like low blood pressure sepsis and respiratory failure to the mortality independently of the stress ulceration cannot be ignored
Among the presentation are Mildly slowed growth Pale skin Delayed closure of fontanelles soft spots Narrow shoulders Triple jointed thumbs absent or small knuckles decreased skin creases at finger joints Inability to fully extend the joints from birth congenital contractures Cleft palate Deformed ears Droopy eyelids
The hallmark of the condition is a sunken appearance of the sternum The most common form is a cup shaped concavity involving the lower end of the sternum a broader concavity involving the upper costal cartilages is possible The lower most ribs may protrude flared ribs Pectus excavatum defects may be symmetric or asymmetric People may also experience chest and back pain which is usually of musculoskeletal origin In mild cases cardiorespiratory function is normal although the heart can be displaced and or rotated In severe cases the right atrium may be compressed mitral valve prolapse may be present and physical capability may be limited due to base lung capacity being decreased Psychological symptoms manifest with feelings of embarrassment social anxiety shame limited capacity for activities and communication negativity intolerance frustration and even depression
CDD is a rare condition with only 1 7 cases per 100 000 A child affected with childhood disintegrative disorder shows normal development Up until this point the child has developed normally in the areas of language skills social skills comprehension skills and has maintained those skills for about two years However between the ages of two and 10 skills acquired are lost almost completely in at least two of the following six functional areas Expressive language skills being able to produce speech and communicate a message Receptive language skills comprehension of language listening and understanding what is communicated Social skills and self care skills Control over bowel and bladder Play skills Motor skillsLack of normal function or impairment also occurs in at least two of the following three areas Social interaction Communication Repetitive behavior and interest patternsIn her book Thinking in Pictures Temple Grandin argues that compared to Kanners classic autism and to Asperger syndrome CDD is characterized with more severe sensory processing disorder but less severe cognitive problems She also argues that compared to most autistic individuals persons with CDD have more severe speech pathology and they usually do not respond well to stimulants
After being transmitted via the bite of an infected flea the Y pestis bacteria become localized in an inflamed lymph node where they begin to colonize and reproduce Infected lymph nodes develop hemorrhages which result in the death of tissue Y pestis bacilli can resist phagocytosis and even reproduce inside phagocytes and kill them As the disease progresses the lymph nodes can hemorrhage and become swollen and necrotic Bubonic plague can progress to lethal septicemic plague in some cases The plague is also known to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the pneumonic plague Symptoms appear 2 7 days after getting bitten and they include Chills General ill feeling malaise High fever 39 C 102 2 F Muscle cramps Seizures Smooth painful lymph gland swelling called a bubo commonly found in the groin but may occur in the armpits or neck most often near the site of the initial infection bite or scratch Pain may occur in the area before the swelling appears Gangrene of the extremities such as toes fingers lips and tip of the nose The best known symptom of bubonic plague is one or more infected enlarged and painful lymph nodes known as buboes Buboes associated with the bubonic plague are commonly found in the armpits upper femoral groin and neck region Symptoms include heavy breathing continuous vomiting of blood hematemesis aching limbs coughing and extreme pain caused by the decay or decomposition of the skin while the person is still alive Additional symptoms include extreme fatigue gastrointestinal problems spleen inflammation lenticulae black dots scattered throughout the body delirium coma organ failure and death Organ failure is a result of the bacteria infecting organs through the bloodstream Other forms of the disease include septicemic plague and pneumonic plague in which the bacterium reproduces in the persons blood and lungs respectively
The clinical findings in this disease can be divided into acute and end stage manifestations In the acute phase patients often present with decreased visual acuity vitritis papillitis and crops of gray white or yellow white outer retinal lesions The clustering of the retinal lesions is important because this often helps to localize the causative nematode If left untreated patients ultimately develop late sequel which may include optic atrophy retinal arterial narrowing diffuse retinal pigment epithelial changes and an abnormal electroretinogram The late findings of this condition are often misinterpreted as unilateral retinitis pigmentosa
The signs and symptoms of an infection depend on the type of disease Some signs of infection affect the whole body generally such as fatigue loss of appetite weight loss fevers night sweats chills aches and pains Others are specific to individual body parts such as skin rashes coughing or a runny nose In certain cases infectious diseases may be asymptomatic for much or even all of their course in a given host In the latter case the disease may only be defined as a disease which by definition means an illness in hosts who secondarily become ill after contact with an asymptomatic carrier An infection is not synonymous with an infectious disease as some infections do not cause illness in a host
Onset usually occurs in childhood however some adult cases have been found Generally physicians look for the symptoms in children Symptoms include cerebellar ataxia spasticity optic atrophy epilepsy loss of motor functions irritability vomiting coma and even fever has been tied to VWM The neurological disorders and symptoms which occur with VWM are not specific to countries they are the same all over the world Neurological abnormalities may not always be present in those who experience onset as adults Symptoms generally appear in young children or infants who were previously developing fairly normally
People with delusional parasitosis believe that parasites worms mites bacteria fungus or some other living organism has infected them and reasoning or logic will not dissuade them from this belief Details vary among those who have the condition though it typically manifests as a crawling and pin pricking sensation that is most commonly described as involving perceived parasites crawling upon or burrowing into the skin sometimes accompanied by an actual physical sensation known as formication Affected people may injure themselves in attempts to be rid of the parasites resulting skin damage includes excoriation bruising and cuts as well as damage caused from using chemical substances and obsessive cleansing routines A preceding event such as a bug bite travel sharing clothes or contact with an infected person is often identified by individuals with DP such events may lead the individual to misattribute symptoms because of more awareness of symptoms they were previously able to ignore Nearly any marking upon the skin or small object or particle found on the person or their clothing can be interpreted as evidence for the parasitic infestation and individuals with the condition commonly compulsively gather such evidence to present to medical professionals This presentation is known as the matchbox sign Ziploc bag sign or specimen sign because the evidence is frequently presented in a small container such as a matchbox The matchbox sign is present in five to eight out of every ten people with DP Related is a digital specimen sign in which individuals bring collections of photographs to document their condition Similar delusions may be present in close relatives a shared condition known as a folie à deux that occurs in 5 to 15 of cases and is considered a shared psychotic disorder Because the internet and the media contribute to furthering shared delusions DP has also been called folie à Internet when affected people are separated their symptoms typically subside but most still require treatment Approximately eight out of ten individuals with DP have co occurring conditions mainly depression followed by substance abuse and anxiety their personal and professional lives are frequently disrupted as they are extremely distressed about their symptoms A 2011 Mayo Clinic study of 108 patients failed to find evidence of skin infestation in skin biopsies and patient provided specimens the study concluded that the feeling of skin infestation was DP
Hematometra typically presents as cyclic cramping pain in the midline of the pelvis or lower abdomen Patients may also report urinary frequency and urinary retention Premenopausal women with hematometra often experience abnormal vaginal bleeding including dysmenorrhea pain during menstruation or amenorrhea lack of menstruation while postmenopausal women are more likely to be asymptomatic Due to the accumulation of blood in the uterus patients may develop low blood pressure or a vasovagal response When palpated the uterus will typically feel firm and enlarged
Onset of PLS usually occurs spontaneously after age 50 and progresses gradually over a number of years or even decades The disorder usually begins in the legs but it may start in the tongue or the hands Symptoms may include difficulty with balance weakness and stiffness in the legs and clumsiness Other common symptoms are spasticity involuntary muscle contraction due to the stretching of muscle which depends on the velocity of the stretch in the hands feet or legs foot dragging and speech and swallowing problems due to involvement of the facial muscles Breathing may also become compromised in the later stages of the disease causing those patients who develop ventilatory failure to require noninvasive ventilatory support Hyperreflexia is another key feature of PLS as seen in patients presenting with the Babinskis sign Some people present with emotional lability and bladder urgency and occasionally people with PLS experience mild cognitive changes detectable on neuropsychological testing particularly on measures of executive function PLS is not considered hereditary when onset is in adulthood however juvenile primary lateral sclerosis JPLS has been linked to a mutation in the ALS2 gene which encodes the cell signalling protein alsin The issue of whether PLS exists as a different entity from ALS is not clear as some patients initially diagnosed as having PLS ultimately develop lower motor neuron signs When this happens it is classed as ALS
Patients may complain of severe problems with dry eyes or with visual obscurations It can also be asymptomatic and only discovered because of subtle lines and marks seen during an eye exam EBMD is a bilateral anterior corneal dystrophy characterized by grayish epithelial fingerprint lines geographic map like lines and dots or microcysts on slit lamp examination Findings are variable and can change with time While the disorder is usually asymptomatic up to 10 of patients may have recurrent corneal erosions usually beginning after age 30 conversely 50 of patients presenting with idiopathic recurrent erosions have evidence of this dystrophy
When people develop visceral leishmaniasis the most typical symptoms are fever and the enlargement of the spleen with enlargement of the liver sometimes being seen as well The blackening of the skin that gave the disease its common name in India does not appear in most strains of the disease and the other symptoms are very easy to mistake for those of malaria Misdiagnosis is dangerous as without proper treatment the mortality rate for kala azar is close to 100 L donovani itself is not usually the direct cause of death in people with kala azar however Pneumonia tuberculosis and dysentery are omnipresent in the immuno depressed regions where leishmaniasis thrives and as with AIDS it is these opportunistic infections that are more likely to kill flaring up in a host whose immune system has been weakened by the L donovani infection Progress of the disease is extremely variable taking anywhere from one to twenty weeks but a typical duration for the Sudanese strain of the disease is narrower between twelve and sixteen weeks Even with recovery kala azar does not always leave its hosts unmarked Some time after successful treatment generally a few months with African kala azar or as much as several years with the Indian strain a secondary form of the disease may set in called post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis or PKDL This condition manifests first as small measle like skin lesions on the face which gradually increase in size and spread over the body Eventually the lesions may coalesce to form disfiguring swollen structures resembling leprosy and occasionally causing blindness if they spread to the eyes This disease is not the same as cutaneous leishmaniasis a milder disease caused by another protozoan of the Leishmania genus which also causes skin lesions
Blood usually oozes from the forehead nails umbilicus and other skin surfaces In addition oozing from mucocutaneous surfaces causing nosebleeds bloodstained tears and vicarious menstruation are common The episodes may be preceded by intense headache and abdominal pain and are usually self limiting In some conditions the secreted fluid is more dilute and appears to be blood tinged while others may have darker bright red secretions resembling blood While the extent of blood loss generally is minimal hematidrosis also results in the skin becoming extremely tender and fragile
Often people with this condition are born with both underdeveloped lungs and a herniated diaphragm Urinary symptoms include a horseshoe kidney Genital symptoms are different according to the biological sex of the baby genetic males 46 XX usually have pseudohermaphroditism ambiguous genitalia and perineal hypospadias Genetic females 46 XX often have septate uterus and duplication of the vagina In some cases karyotype is needed to know the biological sex of the baby Additional symptoms include neoplasm cryptorchidism ventricular septal defect atrial septal defect hernia patent ductus arteriosus Tetralogy of Fallot and penile hypoplasia

Symptoms can be categorised into
CAE is characterized by the presence of absence seizures The absence seizures are usually brief about 4 to 30 seconds but occur frequently usually around a dozen per day but sometimes even hundreds of times per day They involve abrupt impairment of consciousness with loss of awareness and responsiveness behavioral arrest and arrest of the activity that may vary from complete arrest to continuing the activity with an altered status Other seizure features include starring eyelid movement or eye opening and pallor Mild automatisms and mild movements at the beginning of the seizures are frequent but major motor involvement as atonic falls early in the course of the disease excludes this diagnosis The International League Against Epilepsy commission defined absence seizure as of sudden onset interruption of ongoing activities staring possible upwards version of eyes with few seconds duration associated with symmetrical 2 4 Hz mainly 3 Hz spike wave complexes normal background activity Absence seizure was divided into two subgroups Penry et al 1975 first with consciousness impairment and others were associated with the other clinical component namely clonic atonic tonic autonomic and with automatisms Though CAE usually occurs in children with normal neurodevelopment and are sensitive to antiepileptic treatments children with CAE have a risk of academic failure and high rates of attention deficits
Symptoms of CARASIL may include spondylosis deformans lumbago lower back pain due to herniated disks alopecia spasticity in the limbs leading to gait disturbances dysarthria urinary incontinence pseudobulbular signs arteriosclerosis of cerebral arteries mood changes stroke and dementia Individuals with CARASIL may experience spondylosis and alopecia beginning in their teens although alopecia is not seen in all patients Other signs of the disease particularly neurological abnormalities may present from ages 20 40 with symptoms worsening over time About 50 of affected patients present with stroke and most strokes experienced by patients are lacunar infarcts Many patients experience some form of mood changes personality disorders and or dementia over time
The most common clinical finding is hepatosplenomegaly Pruritus gout and mucocutaneous bleeding are occasionally seen
Serrated polyposis syndrome often does not cause symptoms The risk of colon cancer is between 25 and 40 Sessile serrated polyps as seen during endoscopy or colonoscopy are flat rather than raised and are easily overlooked Serrated lesions range in size from small 5 mm to large and often have a mucous cap overlying the polyp Serrated lesions are frequently located on the folds of the colon haustral folds
Nearly all individuals with Legius syndrome show multiple café au lait spots on their skin Symptoms may include Freckles in the axillary and inguinal skin fold Lipomas developing in adulthood Macrocephaly Learning disabilities ADHD Developmental delayFeatures common in neurofibromatosis like Lisch nodules iris hamartomas diagnosed on slit lamp exam bone abnormalities neurofibromas optic pathway gliomas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are absent in Legius syndrome
HHD is characterized by outbreaks of rashes and blisters on the skin Affected areas of skin undergo repeated blistering and inflammation and may be painful to the touch Areas where the skin folds as well as the armpits groin neck buttocks and under the breasts are most commonly affected In addition to blistering other symptoms which accompany HHD include acantholysis erythema and hyperkeratosis
The main symptom is pain which often suddenly appears and is made worse by biting on the involved tooth which may feel raised and prominent in the bite The tooth may be mobile and the lesion may contribute to destruction of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone The pain is deep and throbbing The oral mucosa covering an early periodontal abscess appears erythematous red swollen and painful to touch The surface may be shiny due to stretching of the mucosa over the abscess Before pus has formed the lesion will not be fluctuant and there will be no purulent discharge There may be regional lymphadenitis When pus forms the pressure increases with increasing pain until it spontaneously drains and relieves the pain When pus drains into the mouth a bad taste and smell are perceived Usually drainage occurs via the periodontal pocket or else the infection may spread as a cellulitis or a purulent odontogenic infection Local anatomic factors determine the direction of spread see fascial spaces of the head and neck There may be systemic upset with an onset of pain and fever
The symptoms of ketoacidosis are variable depending on the underlying cause The most common symptoms include nausea vomiting abdominal pain and weakness Breath may also develop the smell of acetone as it is a volatile ketone that can be exhaled Rapid deep breathing or Kussmaul breathing may be present to compensate for the metabolic acidosis Altered mental status is more common in diabetic than alcoholic ketoacidosis

Symptoms caused by hormone excess and associated mass effects include
Small fiber neuropathy is a condition characterized by severe pain Symptoms typically begin in the feet or hands but can start in other parts of the body Some people initially experience a more generalized whole body pain The pain is often described as stabbing or burning or abnormal skin sensations such as tingling or itchiness In some individuals the pain is more severe during times of rest or at night The signs and symptoms of small fiber neuropathy can occur at any point in life depending on the underlying cause Individuals with small fiber neuropathy often cannot feel pain that is concentrated in a very small area such as the prick of a pin However they have an increased sensitivity to pain in general hyperalgesia and experience pain from stimulation that typically does not cause pain allodynia People affected with this condition may also have a reduced ability to differentiate between hot and cold Sudomotor dysfunction is one of the most common and earliest neurophysiological manifestations of small fiber neuropathies In some instances the small fibers of the autonomic nervous system can be affected leading to urinary or bowel problems episodes of rapid heartbeat palpitations dry eyes or mouth or abnormal sweating They can also experience a sharp drop in blood pressure upon standing orthostatic hypotension which can cause dizziness blurred vision or fainting Small fiber neuropathy is considered a form of peripheral neuropathy because it affects the peripheral nervous system which connects the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to cells that detect sensations such as touch smell and pain Insensitivity to pain can be particularly problematic One may be bleeding or have a skin injury without even knowing it
There are a variety of characteristics which indicate that an individual may have phacolytic glaucoma Within older people the lens of the eye may appear to be yellow and lose its transparency becomes cloudy Once the protein begins to seep into the lens permanent damage to the lens may be caused as the precipitate in lens impairs vision Another symptom includes the fading of visual clarity This symptom makes the eye create an image commonly described to appear as though looking through a waterfall If the lens becomes completely opaque the individual will become blind even though the photoreceptor cells are completely functional Other common symptoms include
Symptoms associated with cardiac myxomas are typically due to the effect of the mass of the tumor obstructing the normal flow of blood within the chambers of the heart Because pedunculated myxomas are somewhat mobile symptoms may only occur when the patient is in a particular position Some symptoms of myxoma may be associated with the release of interleukin 6 IL 6 by the myxoma High levels of IL 6 may be associated with a higher risk of embolism of the myxoma Symptoms of a cardiac myxoma include Dyspnea on exertion Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea Fever Weight loss see cachexia Lightheadedness or syncope Loss of consciousness Hemoptysis Sudden death Tachycardia or milder heartrate i e 75 100 cycl min

Hypoglycemic symptoms are divided into two main categories The first category is symptoms caused by low glucose in the brain called neuroglycopenic symptoms The second category of symptoms is caused by the bodys reaction to low glucose in the brain called adrenergic symptoms Everyone experiences different symptoms of hypoglycemia so someone with hypoglycemia may not have all of the symptoms listed above Symptoms also tend to have quick onset It is important to quickly obtain a blood glucose measurement in someone presenting with symptoms of hypoglycemia to properly identify the hypoglycemic episode
Podoconiosis causes bilateral yet asymmetrical leg swelling with overlying firm nodules Early on symptoms may include itching tingling widening of the forefoot and swelling which then progress to soft edema skin fibrosis papillomatosis and nodule formation resembling moss giving rise to the diseases alternate name of mossy foot in some regions of the world As with other forms of tropical lymphedema chronic disease can lead to rigid toes ulceration and bacterial superinfection During acute episodes of adenolymphangitis patients may develops fevers extremity warmth redness and pain These episodes are extremely debilitating and account for many days of activity and productivity loss each year
Cause Allergic reactions from blood transfusion may occur from the presence of allergy causing antigens within the donors blood or transfusion of antibodies from a donor who has allergies followed by antigen exposure An allergic transfusion reaction is a type of transfusion reaction that is defined according to the Center for Disease Control CDC as
When the body is exposed to the cold in individuals affected by the condition hives appear and the skin in the affected area typically becomes itchy Hives result from dilation of capillaries which allow fluid to flow out into the surrounding tissue which is the epidermis They resolve when the body absorbs this fluid The border of a hive is described as polycyclic or made up of many circles and changes as fluid leaks out and then is absorbed Pressing on a hive causes the skin to blanch turn pale as blood flow is interrupted distinguishing it from a bruise or papule Hives may appear immediately or after a delay Hives can last for a few minutes or a few days and vary from person to person Also a burning sensation occurs A serious reaction is most likely to occur for patients where the hives occur with less than 3 minutes of exposure during a cold test
Signs and symptoms of PTS in the leg may include pain aching or cramping heaviness itching or tingling swelling edema varicose veins brownish or reddish skin discoloration ulcerThese signs and symptoms may vary among patients and over time With PTS these symptoms typically are worse after walking or standing for long periods of time and improve with resting or elevating the leg PTS lowers a persons quality of life after DVT specifically with regards to physical and psychological symptoms and limitations in daily activities

Periorbital cellulitis must be differentiated from orbital cellulitis which is an emergency and requires intravenous IV antibiotics In contrast to orbital cellulitis patients with periorbital cellulitis do not have bulging of the eye proptosis limited eye movement ophthalmoplegia pain on eye movement or loss of vision If any of these features is present one must assume that the patient has orbital cellulitis and begin treatment with IV antibiotics CT scan may be done to delineate the extension of the infection Affected individuals may experience swelling redness discharge pain shut eye conjunctival infection fever mild slightly blurred vision teary eyes and some reduction in vision Typical signs include periorbital erythema induration tenderness and warmth
The syndrome shows a wide range of abnormalities and symptoms The main characteristics of the syndrome are exocrine pancreatic dysfunction hematologic abnormalities and growth retardation Only the first two of these are included in the clinical diagnostic criteria Hematologic abnormalities neutropenia may be intermittent or persistent and is the most common hematological finding Low neutrophil counts leave patients at risk of developing severe recurrent infections that may be life threatening Anemia low red blood cell counts and thrombocytopenia low platelet counts may also occur Bone marrow is typically hypocellular with maturation arrest in the myeloid lineages that give rise to neutrophils macrophages platelets and red blood cells Patients may also develop progressive marrow failure or transform to acute myelogenous leukemia Exocrine pancreatic dysfunction Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency arises due to a lack of acinar cells that produce digestive enzymes These are extensively depleted and replaced by fat A lack of pancreatic digestive enzymes leaves patients unable to digest and absorb fat However pancreatic status may improve with age in some patients Growth retardation More than 50 of patients are below the third percentile for height and short stature appears to be unrelated to nutritional status Other skeletal abnormalities include metaphyseal dysostosis 45 of patients thoracic dystrophy rib cage abnormalities in 46 of patients and costochondral thickening shortened ribs with flared ends in 32 of patients Skeletal problems are one of the most variable components of SDS with 50 affected siblings from the same family discordant for clinical presentation or type of abnormality Despite this a careful review of radiographs from 15 patients indicated that all of them had at least one skeletal anomaly though many were subclinical Other features include metaphysial dysostosis mild hepatic dysfunction increased frequency of infections
In young patients mild hypermetropia may not produce any symptoms The signs and symptoms of far sightedness include blurry vision frontal or fronto temporal headaches eye strain tiredness of eyes etc The common symptom is eye strain Difficulty seeing with both eyes binocular vision may occur as well as difficulty with depth perception The asthenopic symptoms and near blur are usually seen after close work especially in the evening or night
Clinical features of NSF develop within days to months and in some cases years following exposure to some GBCAs The main symptoms are the thickening and hardening of the skin associated with brawny hyperpigmentation typically presenting in a symmetric fashion The skin gradually becomes fibrotic and adheres to the underlying fascia The symptoms initiate distally in the limbs and progress proximally sometimes involving the trunk Joint contractures of the fingers elbows and knees can develop secondary to skin involvement and can severely impair physical function While skin involvement is on the foreground the process may involve any organ e g the eye heart diaphragm pleura pericardium and kidneys as well as the lungs and liver
Nervous system involvement may be seen with acidosis and occurs more often with respiratory acidosis than with metabolic acidosis Signs and symptoms that may be seen in acidosis include headaches confusion feeling tired tremors sleepiness flapping tremor and dysfunction of the cerebrum of the brain which may progress to coma if there is no intervention
The primary skin lesion usually starts with a macule that is painless round and erythematous Then it develops into a pustule and then a bulla with central hemorrhagic focus The bulla progresses into an ulcer which extends laterally Finally it becomes a gangrenous ulcer with a central black eschar surrounded by an erythematous halo The lesions may be single or multiple They are most commonly seen in perineum and under arm pit However they can occur in any part of the body
Most 80 to 100 amputees experience a phantom limb with some of them having non painful sensations The amputee may feel very strongly that the phantom limb is still part of the body People will sometimes feel as if they are gesturing feel itches twitch or even try to pick things up The missing limb often feels shorter and may feel as if it is in a distorted and painful position Occasionally the pain can be made worse by stress anxiety and weather changes Exposure to extreme weather conditions especially below freezing temperatures can cause increased sensitivity to the sensation Phantom limb pain is usually intermittent but can be continuous in some cases The frequency and intensity of attacks usually declines with time Repressed memories in phantom limbs could potentially explain the reason for existing sensations after amputation Specifically there have been several reports from patients of painful clenching spasms in the phantom hand with the feeling of their nails digging into their palms The motor output is amplified due to the missing limb therefore the patient may experience the overflow of information as pain The patient contains repressed memories from previous motor commands of clenching the hand and sensory information from digging their nails into their palm These memories remain due to previous neural connections in the brain
Generally it is preferable to describe specific signs in lieu of declaring fetal distress that include
The disease has four stages Characterized by worsening insomnia resulting in panic attacks paranoia and phobias This stage lasts for about four months Hallucinations and panic attacks become noticeable continuing for about five months Complete inability to sleep is followed by rapid loss of weight This lasts for about three months Dementia during which the person becomes unresponsive or mute over the course of six months is the final stage of the disease after which death follows Other symptoms include profuse sweating miosis pinpoint pupils sudden entrance into menopause or impotence neck stiffness and elevation of blood pressure and heart rate The sporadic form of the disease often presents with double vision Constipation is common as well As the disease progresses the person becomes stuck in a state of pre sleep limbo or hypnagogia which is the state just before sleep in healthy individuals During these stages people commonly and repeatedly move their limbs as if dreaming The age of onset is variable ranging from 13 to 60 years with an average of 50 The disease can be detected prior to onset by genetic testing Death usually occurs between 6 36 months from onset The presentation of the disease varies considerably from person to person even among people within the same family in the sporadic form for example sleep problems are not commonly reported and early symptoms are ataxia cognitive impairment and double vision
The primary features are infertility and small poorly functioning testicles Often symptoms may be subtle and many people do not realize they are affected Sometimes symptoms are more prominent and may include weaker muscles greater height poor coordination less body hair breast growth and low libido Often these symptoms are noticed only at puberty
Urticaria are characterized by dermal edema wheal swollen and erythema flare red also known as hives Hive lesions typically last less than 24 hours and are usually itchy pruritic Hives can appear anywhere on the body and they may change shape move around disappear and reappear over short periods of time
Symptoms of Lafora disease begin to develop during the early adolescent years and symptoms progress as time passes In the years before then there is generally no indication of the presence of the disease though in a few cases the disease presents as a learning disorder around 5 years of age In extremely rare cases symptoms may not show at all until as late as the 3rd decade of life though these cases have slower progression than typical LD The most common feature of Lafora disease is seizures that have been reported mainly as occipital seizures and myoclonic seizures with some cases of generalized tonic clonic seizures atypical absence seizures and atonic and complex partial seizures Other symptoms common with the seizures are drop attacks ataxia temporary blindness visual hallucinations and a quickly developing and dramatic dementia Other common signs and symptoms associated with Lafora disease are behavioral changes due to the frequency of seizures Over time those affected with Lafora disease have brain changes that cause confusion speech difficulties depression decline in intellectual function impaired judgement and impaired memory If areas of the cerebellum are affected by seizures it is common to see problems with speech coordination and balance in Lafora patients For dogs that are affected with Lafora disease common symptoms are rapid shuddering shaking or jerking of the canines head backwards high pitched vocalizations that could indicate the dog is panicking seizures and as the disease progresses dementia blindness and loss of balance Within ten years of developing symptoms life expectancy has known to go down People who advance to adulthood tend to lose their ability to do daily tasks by themselves which can lead them to having to have comprehensive care If their symptoms have become onset extremely fast or at an early age comprehensive care allows one to get treatment in ways that are not only regarding receiving their medication but it also includes both physical and mental health towards the daily activities that one would normally perform by themselves
The term congenital refers to a condition present from birth not acquired and amaurosis refers to a loss of vision not associated with a lesion However beyond these general descriptions the presentation of LCA can vary because it is associated with multiple genes LCA is typically characterized by nystagmus sluggish or absent pupillary responses and severe vision loss or blindness
This benign patch appears on the skin at birth or in early childhood In most people these are under 10 centimeters 3 9 in in size If there is doubt about the diagnosis rubbing the area causes the skin around the lesion to become red while the lesion itself does not change in color Often the patches are difficult to see against the background color of the patient s skin but if sunburn develops then the white area stands out prominently The involved area is lighter than the normal skin not because of a loss of pigment occurs but because blood vessels are constricted producing a permanent blanching of the area This blanching is a functional rather than a structural abnormality presumed to be caused by local increased sensitivity to catecholamines Although the cutaneous vasculature appears normal histologically the blood vessels within the nevus do not respond to injection of vasodilators It has been postulated that the persistent pallor may represent a sustained localized adrenergic vasoconstriction Results of a skin biopsy would be interpreted as normal and only physiological testing can reveal the nevus in contrast to normal skin Stroking the patch elicits no red flare Only the normal skin would react with a characteristic erythematous response Examination under a Wood lamp can also reveal the nevus anemicus patch will not emphasize as a patch of vitiligo would
A combination of postural changes baby unstable pelvic joints under the influence of pregnancy hormones and changes in the centre of gravity can all add to the varying degrees of pain or discomfort In some cases it can come on suddenly or following a fall sudden abduction of the thighs opening too wide too quickly or an action that has strained the joint PGP can begin as early as the first trimester of pregnancy Pain is usually felt low down over the symphyseal joint and this area may be extremely tender to the touch Pain may also be felt in the hips groin and lower abdomen and can radiate down the inner thighs Women with PGP may begin to waddle or shuffle and may be aware of an audible clicking sound coming from the pelvis PGP can develop slowly during pregnancy gradually gaining in severity as the pregnancy progresses During pregnancy and postpartum the symphyseal gap can be felt moving or straining when walking climbing stairs or turning over in bed these activities can be difficult or even impossible The pain may remain static e g in one place such as the front of the pelvis producing the feeling of having been kicked in other cases it may start in one area and move to other areas It is also possible that a woman may experience a combination of symptoms Any weight bearing activity has the potential of aggravating an already unstable pelvis producing symptoms that may limit the ability of the woman to carry out many daily activities She may experience pain involving movements such as dressing getting in and out of the bath rolling in bed climbing the stairs or sexual activity Pain may also be present when lifting carrying pushing or pulling The symptoms and their severity experienced by women with PGP vary but include
Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing shortness of breath chest tightness and coughing Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up During recovery from an asthma attack exacerbation it may appear pus like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms usually in response to triggers whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms
As Lutembachers syndrome is known for ASD and MS most of the symptoms experienced will be associated with ASD and MS For most people they will remain asymptomatic experience no symptoms but when symptoms are shown they are due mainly to ASD and will vary depending on the size of the hole in the atria If the patient has a large ASD pulmonary congestion blood or fluid buildup in the lungs will happen later but if the patient has a small ASD symptoms will appear early in the disorder In general unless the ASD and mitral stenosis causing Lutembachers syndrome is severe symptoms may not appear until the second and third decade of the patients life As many of the patients are asymptomatic and symptoms may not appear until later in life the duration or frequency of the symptoms varies For symptoms such as palpitations ventricular overload heart failure and pulmonary congestion these symptoms may be sudden and not that frequent as they are very severe symptoms For symptoms such as loud mitral S1 pulmonary S2 mid diastolic murmur fatigue reduced exercise tolerance weight gain ankle edema and right upper quadrant pain and ascities these symptoms may be less frequent and severe their duration may be only a few seconds minutes or even months
People affected by T cell prolymphocytic leukemia typically have systemic disease at presentation including enlargement of the liver and spleen widespread enlargement of the lymph nodes and skin infiltrates Due to the systemic nature of this disease leukemic cells can be found in peripheral blood lymph nodes bone marrow spleen liver and skin A high lymphocyte count 100 x 109 L along with low amounts of red blood cells and platelets in the blood are common findings HTLV 1 serologies are negative and serum immunoglobins are within normal limits with no paraproteins present
People with NAFLD often have no noticeable symptoms and NAFLD is often only detected during routine blood tests or unrelated abdominal imaging or liver biopsy In some cases NAFLD can cause symptoms related to liver dysfunction such as fatigue malaise and dull right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort Mild yellow discoloration of the skin may occur although this is rare NASH can severely impair liver function leading to cirrhosis liver failure and liver cancer
With patulous Eustachian tube variations in upper airway pressure associated with respiration are transmitted to the middle ear through the Eustachian tube This causes an unpleasant fullness feeling in the middle ear and alters the auditory perception Complaints seem to include muffled hearing and autophony In addition patulous Eustachian tube generally feels dry with no clogged feeling or sinus pressure Patients hear their own voice or its echo from inside They describe it as being amplified and unpleasant Lying head down may help since it increases venous blood pressure and congestion of the mucosa

Minor depressive disorder is very similar to major depressive disorder in the symptoms present Generally a persons mood is affected by thoughts and feelings of being sad or down on themself or by a loss of interest in nearly all activities People can experience ups and downs in their life everyday where an event action stress or many other factors can affect their feelings on that day However depression occurs when those feelings of sadness persist for longer than a few weeks A person is considered to have minor depressive disorder if they experience 2 to 4 depressive symptoms during a 2 week period The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders lists the major depressive symptoms Depressed mood most of the day and or loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities must be experienced by the individual to be considered to have minor depressive disorder Without either of these two symptoms the disorder is not classified as minor depressive disorder Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss or weight gain without trying to diet an increase decrease in appetite can provide clues as well insomnia or hypersomnia psychomotor agitation or psychomotor retardation fatigue or loss of energy and feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt All of these signs can compound on each other to create the last major symptom group of minor depressive disorder thoughts of death suicidal thoughts plans to commit suicide or a suicide attempt Minor depressive disorder differs from major depressive disorder in the number of symptoms present with 5 or more symptoms necessary for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder Both disorders require either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities to be one of the symptoms and the symptoms need to be present for two weeks or longer Symptoms also must be present for the majority of the length of a day and present for a majority of the days in the two week period Diagnosis can only occur if the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment Dysthymia consists of the same depressive symptoms but its main differentiable feature is its longer lasting nature as compared to minor depressive disorder Dysthymia was replaced in the DSM 5 by persistent depressive disorder which combined dysthymia with chronic major depressive disorder
Haemochromatosis is protean in its manifestations i e often presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of other diagnoses that affect specific organ systems Many of the signs and symptoms below are uncommon and most patients with the hereditary form of haemochromatosis do not show any overt signs of disease nor do they have premature morbidity if they are diagnosed early but more often than not the condition is diagnosed only at autopsy Presently the classic triad of cirrhosis bronze skin and diabetes is less common because of earlier diagnosis The more common clinical manifestations include Fatigue Malaise Joint pain mainly knee and hand Abdominal pain Bronze or gray skin color for this the illness was named bronze diabetes when it was first described by Armand Trousseau in 1865 Liver fibrosis or cirrhosis with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma Liver disease is always preceded by evidence of liver dysfunction including elevated serum enzymes specific to the liver clubbing of the fingers leuconychia asterixis hepatomegaly palmar erythema and spider naevi Cirrhosis can also present with jaundice yellowing of the skin and ascites Diabetes mellitus type 2 HH patients have insulin resistance for liver disease and poor insulin secretion due to pancreatic damage from iron deposition Erectile dysfunction and hypogonadism resulting in decreased libido amenorrhea Congestive heart failure abnormal heart rhythms or pericarditis Arthritis of the hands especially the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints but also the knee and shoulder joints Weight lossLess common findings including
The signs and symptoms of POEMS syndrome are highly variable This often leads to long delays e g 13 18 months between the onset of initial symptoms and diagnosis In addition to the signs and symptoms indicated by the POEMS acronym the PEST acronym is used to describe some of the other signs and symptoms of the disease PEST stands for Papilledema evidence of Extravascular volume overload ascites pleural effusion pericardial effusion and lower extremity edema Sclerotic bone lesions and Thrombocytosis erythrocytosis i e increased in blood platelets and red blood cells Other features of the disease include a tendency toward leukocytosis blood clot formation abnormal lung function restrictive lung disease pulmonary hypertension and impaired lung diffusion capacity very high blood levels of the cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF and an overlap with the signs and symptoms of multicentric Castleman disease

Due to its perception altering effects the onset of narcosis may be hard to recognize At its most benign narcosis results in relief of anxiety a feeling of tranquillity and mastery of the environment These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide They also resemble though not as closely the effects of alcohol and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam Such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed Once stabilized the effects generally remain the same at a given depth only worsening if the diver ventures deeper The most dangerous aspects of narcosis are the impairment of judgement multi tasking and coordination and the loss of decision making ability and focus Other effects include vertigo and visual or auditory disturbances The syndrome may cause exhilaration giddiness extreme anxiety depression or paranoia depending on the individual diver and the divers medical or personal history When more serious the diver may feel overconfident disregarding normal safe diving practices Slowed mental activity as indicated by increased reaction time and increased errors in cognitive function are effects which increase the risk of a diver mismanaging an incident Narcosis reduces both the perception of cold discomfort and shivering and thereby affects the production of body heat and consequently allows a faster drop in the core temperature in cold water with reduced awareness of the developing problem The relation of depth to narcosis is sometimes informally known as Martinis law the idea that narcosis results in the feeling of one martini for every 10 m 33 ft below 20 m 66 ft depth Professional divers use such a calculation only as a rough guide to give new divers a metaphor comparing a situation they may be more familiar with Reported signs and symptoms are summarized against typical depths in meters and feet of sea water in the following table closely adapted from Deeper into Diving by Lippman and Mitchell
This type of leukemia is characterized by More than 55 of circulating cells in peripheral blood red blood cells white blood cells and platelets collectively are prolymphocytes Generally prolymphocyte proportion exceeds 90 Minimal or absence of lymphadenopathy abnormalities in size number or consistency of lymph nodes Splenomegaly Abnormal enlargement of the spleen High white blood cell count B symptoms Fever night sweats and or weight lossSimilar to other leukemias B cell prolymphocytic leukemia is often asymptomatic The most common signs and symptoms are the result of the inability of the bone marrow to produce normal levels of blood cells Anaemia due to lack of red blood cells More frequent severe and prolonged infections due to lack of normal white blood cells Bleeding and bruising due to lack of platelets
Skin The pigment is deposited throughout the skin but only becomes apparent in certain locations where the concentration is great enough to be seen clinically This usually occurs in areas where connective tissue is thick joints tympanic membrane or close to the surface of the skin thenar and hypothenar eminences and the sides of the fingers In exogenous ochronosis the hyperpigmentation is localized to the area where the inciting agent is applied Intradermal nevi can appear like blue nevi Eye Ocular manifestations are frequent in patients with ochronosis most commonly hyperpigmentation of the sclera primarily observed symmetrically to both sides of the cornea within the palpebral fissure Furthermore brown pigment spots in the limbus are generally considered pathognomonic These ocular signs generally occur early in the development of the disease and can serve as a valuable diagnostic feature of the disease Cartilage Darkening and hardening of ear cartilage is a prominent feature of ochronosis Nasal cartilage is also frequently involved The voice can be affected by hardening of the laryngeal cartilage Stiffening of the ribs with decreased lung function has also been reported The intervertebral cartilage is also more prone to herniation Connective tissue Hardening of tendons and ligaments can predispose them to rupture Color changes in the joints can be observed clinically Arthropathy is common due to chronic inflammation and microruptures Heart valves Stenosis can results from the increased rigidity of the connective tissue as well as chronic inflammation Symptoms of exogenous ochronosis include Yellow brown banana shaped fibers Caviar like papules Brown grey or blue black hyperpigmentationMost of the lesions are seen on areas of the body that get the most sun
Localized redness and swelling Pain or burning along the length of the vein Vein being hard and cord likeThere is usually a slow onset of a tender red area along the superficial veins on the skin A long thin red area may be seen as the inflammation follows a superficial vein This area may feel hard warm and tender The skin around the vein may be itchy and swollen The area may begin to throb or burn Symptoms may be worse when the leg is lowered especially when first getting out of bed in the morning A low grade fever may occur Sometimes phlebitis may occur where a peripheral intravenous line was started The surrounding area may be sore and tender along the vein
Patients typically complain of muscle stiffness that can continue to focal weakness This muscle stiffness cannot be walked off in contrast to myotonia congenita These symptoms are increased and sometimes induced in cold environments For example some patients have reported that eating ice cream leads to a stiffening of the throat For other patients exercise consistently induces symptoms of myotonia or weakness Typical presentations of this are during squatting or repetitive fist clenching Some patients also indicate that specific foods are able to induce symptoms of paramyotonia congenita Isolated cases have reported that carrots and watermelon are able to induce these symptoms The canonical definition of this disorder precludes permanent weakness in the definition of this disorder In practice however this has not been strictly adhered to in the literature
In health the dorsal surface of the tongue is covered in tuft like projections called lingual papillae some of which are associated with taste buds which give the tongue an irregular surface texture and a white pink color Geographic tongue is characterized by areas of atrophy and depapillation loss of papillae leaving an erythematous darker red and smoother surface than the unaffected areas The depapillated areas are usually well demarcated and bordered by a slightly raised white yellow or grey serpiginous snaking peripheral zone A lesion of geographic tongue may start as a white patch before the depapillation occurs In certain cases there may be only one lesion but this is uncommon the lesions will typically occur in multiple locations on the tongue and coalesce over time to form the typical map like appearance The lesions usually change in shape and size and migrate to other areas sometimes within hours The condition may affect only part of the tongue with a predilection for the tip and the sides of the tongue or the entire dorsal surface at any one time The condition goes through periods of remission and relapse Loss of the white peripheral zone is thought to signify periods of mucosal healing There are usually no symptoms other than the unusual appearance of the tongue but in some cases persons may experience pain or burning e g when eating hot acidic spicy or other kinds of foods e g cheese tomatoes fruit Where there is a burning symptom other causes of a burning sensation on the tongue are considered such as oral candidiasis
Patients present with red eye burning tearing foreign body sensation and mild photophobia Upon examination the conjunctiva appears inflamed and thickened especially at the limbus
Signs and symptoms of familial dysautonomia usually commence during infancy and worsen with age and may include gastrointestinal dysmotility including erratic gastric emptying gastroesophageal reflux abnormal esophageal peristalsis oropharyngeal incoordination dysphagia as poor suckling in infancy and frequent choking gagging recurrent vomiting poor weight gain growth delayed development especially walking and puberty especially in girls recurrent aspiration pneumonia due to inhalation of food or vomitus with possible secondary chronic lung disease absence of overflow tears during crying corneal ulcers red skin blotches and excessive sweating often during eating or excitement breath holding spells slurred speech nasal voice tongue ulcers from accidental self injuries hyporeflexia variable absence of deep tendon reflexes hypotonia enuresis arrhythmias hypertension including episodic hypertension in response to emotional stress or visceral pain hypotension including orthostatic hypertension with compensatory tachycardia invariably present impaired but not absent temperature and pain perception leading to frequent accidental injury impaired proprioception a smooth glossy tongue scoliosis with possibly secondary restrictive lung disease abnormal gait short stature chronic renal failure common visual impairment variable cognitive ability characteristic facial features that develop with time impaired vibration perception lack of fungiform papilla of the tongue and impaired taste perception especially for sweetness Autonomic crises In children with FD recurrent episodes of vomiting may occur Such episodes may be triggered by physical e g infection or emotional stress may occur every 15 20 minutes for over 24 hours and may be accompanied with significant hypertension drenching sweat breathing issues fever tachycardia aspiration pneumonia skin blotches drooling and negative personality change Pain insensitivity Insensitivity or indifference to painful stimuli may lead to frequent progressive self mutilation burns and ulcers There may be self mutilation of the tongue especially in toddlers during teething lips and cheeks or loss of teeth Compulsive oral biting may result in ulcers or tumour like masses Riga Fede disease
Symptoms of Bennett fracture are instability of the CMC joint of the thumb accompanied by pain and weakness of the pinch grasp Characteristic signs include pain swelling and ecchymosis around the base of the thumb and thenar eminence and especially over the CMC joint of the thumb Physical examination demonstrates instability of the CMC joint of the thumb The patient will often manifest a weakened ability to grasp objects or perform such tasks as tying shoes and tearing a piece of paper Other complaints include intense pain experienced upon catching the thumb on an object such as when reaching into a pants pocket
The distinguishing characteristics of POIS are
Cough Wheezing Nasal irritationIn some cases it is asymptomatic
Findings of tenderness induration pain and or erythema along the course of a superficial vein usually establish a clinical diagnosis especially in patients with known risk factors In addition there is often a palpable sometimes nodular cord due to thrombus within the affected vein Persistence of this cord when the extremity is raised suggests the presence of thrombus
Silent sinus syndrome can cause facial asymmetry usually without pain and vision problems such as diplopia and enophthalmos It may also cause headaches and a feeling of fullness in the nose
In mild disease patients present with eyelid retraction In fact upper eyelid retraction is the most common ocular sign of Graves orbitopathy This finding is associated with lid lag on infraduction Von Graefes sign eye globe lag on supraduction Kochers sign a widened palpebral fissure during fixation Dalrymples sign and an incapacity of closing the eyelids completely lagophthalmos Stellwags sign Due to the proptosis eyelid retraction and lagophthalmos the cornea is more prone to dryness and may present with chemosis punctate epithelial erosions and superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis The patients also have a dysfunction of the lacrimal gland with a decrease of the quantity and composition of tears produced Non specific symptoms with these pathologies include irritation grittiness photophobia tearing and blurred vision Pain is not typical but patients often complain of pressure in the orbit Periorbital swelling due to inflammation can also be observed Eye signsIn moderate active disease the signs and symptoms are persistent and increasing and include myopathy The inflammation and edema of the extraocular muscles lead to gaze abnormalities The inferior rectus muscle is the most commonly affected muscle and patient may experience vertical diplopia on upgaze and limitation of elevation of the eyes due to fibrosis of the muscle This may also increase the intraocular pressure of the eyes The double vision is initially intermittent but can gradually become chronic The medial rectus is the second most commonly affected muscle but multiple muscles may be affected in an asymmetric fashion In more severe and active disease mass effects and cicatricial changes occur within the orbit This is manifested by a progressive exophthalmos a restrictive myopathy that restricts eye movements and an optic neuropathy With enlargement of the extraocular muscle at the orbital apex the optic nerve is at risk of compression The orbital fat or the stretching of the nerve due to increased orbital volume may also lead to optic nerve damage The patient experiences a loss of visual acuity visual field defect afferent pupillary defect and loss of color vision This is an emergency and requires immediate surgery to prevent permanent blindness
Lymphocytic meningoradiculitis is characterized by an intense spinal pain in the lumbar and cervical regions radiating to the extremities Symptoms may include facial paralysis abducens palsy anorexia tiredness headache double vision paraesthesia and erythema migrans
Central retinal artery occlusion is characterized by painless acute vision loss in one eye Upon fundoscopic exam one would expect to find cherry red spot 90 a morphologic description in which the normally red background of the choroid is sharply outlined by the swollen opaque retina in the central retina retinal opacity in the posterior pole 58 pallor 39 retinal arterial attenuation 32 and optic disk edema 22 During later stages of onset one may also find plaques emboli and optic atrophy
Acne fulminans begins as pain and inflammation in the joints It eventually progresses into a swelling of the lymph nodes located at the base of the neck causing inflexibility in the neck within weeks after the nodes swell This swelling will eventually decrease but this decrease will be accompanied by an increased inflammation and swelling of the joints as well as a complete loss of appetite though these symptoms are often ignored After some time the disease will cause an extreme loss of weight and atrophy of the muscles leading to the decline of physical abilities
The DSM IV specifies that acute stress disorder must be accompanied by the presence of dissociative symptoms which largely differentiates it from post traumatic stress disorder Dissociative symptoms include a sense of numbing or detachment from emotional reactions a sense of physical detachment such as seeing oneself from another perspective decreased awareness of ones surroundings the perception that ones environment is unreal or dreamlike and the inability to recall critical aspects of the traumatic event dissociative amnesia In addition to these characteristics ASD can be present in the following symptom clusters intrusion negative mood disassociation avoidance of distressing memories and emotional arousal Intrusion symptoms include recurring and distressing dreams flashbacks or memories related to the traumatic event and related somatic symptoms Emotional arousal symptoms include sleep disturbances hypervigilance difficulties with concentration more common startle response and irritability
The first sign of neonatal diabetes is often slowed fetal growth followed by unusually low birthweight At some point within the first six months of life infants with neonatal diabetes tend to experience the classic symptoms of type 1 diabetes thirst frequent urination and signs of dehydration The timing of symptom onset varies with the type of neonatal diabetes Those with transient neonatal diabetes tend to have symptoms in the first few days or weeks of life with affected children showing weight loss and signs of dehydration along with high levels of sugar in the blood and urine Some children also have high levels of ketones in the bood and urine or signs of metabolic acidosis Permanent neonatal diabetes starts slightly later typicalaly around six weeks of age Regardless of type preterm infants tend to experience symptoms earlier typically around one week of age Neonatal diabetes is classified into three subtypes permanent transient and syndromic each with distinct genetic causes and symptoms Syndromic neonatal diabetes is the term for diabetes as just one component of any of several complex syndromes that affect neonates including IPEX syndrome Wolcott Rallison syndrome and Wolfram syndrome Symptoms vary widely based on the syndrome
The key symptom of RCVS is recurrent thunderclap headaches which over 95 of patients experience In two thirds of cases it is the only symptom These headaches are typically bilateral very severe and peak in intensity within a minute They may last from minutes to days and may be accompanied by nausea photophobia phonophobia or vomiting Some patients experience only one headache but on average there are four attacks over a period of one to four weeks A milder residual headache persists between severe attacks for half of patients 1 17 of patients experience seizures 8 43 of patients show neurologic problems especially visual disturbances but also hemiplegia ataxia dysarthria aphasia and numbness These neurologic issues typically disappear within minutes or a few hours more persistent symptoms may indicate a stroke Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is present in a small minority of patients This condition features the unique property that the patients cerebral arteries can spontaneously constrict and relax back and forth over a period of time without intervention and without clinical findings Vasospasm is common post subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral aneurysm but in RCVS only 25 of patients have symptoms post subarachnoid hemorrhage
Affected patients are usually adults experiencing multiple episodes of spontaneous hypoglycemia with neuroglycopenic symptoms
The reported symptoms are very variable and frequently have been present for many months before the condition is diagnosed Reported symptoms may include some of the following
Symptoms of this disorder commonly appear between one and two years of age Symptoms include mildly coarsened facial features deafness ichthyosis and an enlarged liver and spleen hepatosplenomegaly Abnormalities of the skeleton such as a curving of the spine and breast bone may occur The skin of individuals afflicted with this disorder is typically dry Children affected by this disorder develop more slowly than normal and may display delayed speech and walking skills The disease is fatal with symptoms that include neurological damage and severe mental retardation These sulfatase enzymes are responsible for breaking down and recycling complex sulfate containing sugars from lipids and mucopolysaccharides within the lysosome The accumulation of lipids and mucopolysaccharides inside the lysosome results in symptoms associated with this disorder As of 2018 75 100 cases of MSD had been reported worldwide
The way CML presents depends on the stage of the disease at diagnosis as it has been known to skip stages in some cases Most patients 90 are diagnosed during the chronic stage which is most often asymptomatic In these cases it may be diagnosed incidentally with an elevated white blood cell count on a routine laboratory test It can also present with symptoms indicative of hepatosplenomegaly and the resulting left upper quadrant pain this causes The enlarged spleen may put pressure on the stomach causing a loss of appetite and resulting weight loss It may also present with mild fever and night sweats due to an elevated basal level of metabolism Some 10 are diagnosed during the accelerated stage which most often presents bleeding petechiae and ecchymosis In these patients fevers are most commonly the result of opportunistic infections Some patients are initially diagnosed in the blast phase in which the symptoms are most likely fever bone pain and an increase in bone marrow fibrosis
The mucopolysaccharidoses share many clinical features but have varying degrees of severity These features may not be apparent at birth but progress as storage of GAGs affects bone skeletal structure connective tissues and organs Neurological complications may include damage to neurons which send and receive signals throughout the body as well as pain and impaired motor function This results from compression of nerves or nerve roots in the spinal cord or in the peripheral nervous system the part of the nervous system that connects the brain and spinal cord to sensory organs such as the eyes and to other organs muscles and tissues throughout the body Depending on the mucopolysaccharidosis subtype affected individuals may have normal intellect or have cognitive impairments may experience developmental delay or may have severe behavioral problems Many individuals have hearing loss either conductive in which pressure behind the eardrum causes fluid from the lining of the middle ear to build up and eventually congeal neurosensory in which tiny hair cells in the inner ear are damaged or both Communicating hydrocephalus in which the normal reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid is blocked and causes increased pressure inside the head is common in some of the mucopolysaccharidoses Surgically inserting a shunt into the brain can drain fluid The eyes cornea often becomes cloudy from intracellular storage and glaucoma and degeneration of the retina also may affect the patients vision Physical symptoms generally include coarse or rough facial features including a flat nasal bridge thick lips and enlarged mouth and tongue short stature with disproportionately short trunk dwarfism dysplasia abnormal bone size and or shape and other skeletal irregularities thickened skin enlarged organs such as liver hepatomegaly or spleen splenomegaly hernias and excessive body hair growth Short and often claw like hands progressive joint stiffness and carpal tunnel syndrome can restrict hand mobility and function Recurring respiratory infections are common as are obstructive airway disease and obstructive sleep apnea Many affected individuals also have heart disease often involving enlarged or diseased heart valves Another lysosomal storage disease often confused with the mucopolysaccharidoses is mucolipidosis In this disorder excessive amounts of fatty materials known as lipids another principal component of living cells are stored in addition to sugars Persons with mucolipidosis may share some of the clinical features associated with the mucopolysaccharidoses certain facial features bony structure abnormalities and damage to the brain and increased amounts of the enzymes needed to break down the lipids are found in the blood
Lumbar hyperlordosis also known as anterior pelvic tilt has a noticeable impact on the height of individuals with this medical issue a height loss of 0 5 2 5 inches 1 27 6 35 centimeters is common For example the height loss was measured by measuring the patients height while he or she is standing straight with exaggerated curves in the upper and lower back and again after he or she fixed this issue with no exaggerated curves both of these measurements were taken in the morning with a gap of 6 months and the growth plates of the patient were checked to make sure that they were closed to rule out natural growth The height loss occurs in the torso region and once the person fixes his or her back the persons Body Mass Index will reduce since he or she is taller and the stomach will also appear to be slimmer A similar impact has also been noticed in transfeminine people who have weaker muscles in the lower back due to increased estrogen intake and other such treatments However the cause of height loss in both situations is a little different even though the impact is similar In the first scenario it can be due to a genetic condition trauma to the spine pregnancy in women increased abdominal fat or a sedentary lifestyle sitting too much causes muscle imbalances and is the most common reason for this issue and in the second scenario the estrogen weakens the muscles in the area Merely slouching doesnt cause height loss even though it may make a person look shorter slouching may lead to perceived height loss whereas lumbar hyperlordosis leads to actual and measured height loss To make it easier to understand the difference if a person loses a vertebra which is around 2 inches or 5 centimeters in height in his or her spine it doesnt matter if he or she slouches or not he or she will be shorter regardless of his or her posture Lumbar hyperlordosis of course doesnt make you lose a vertebra but it bends them in such a way that your spines vertical height is reduced Although lumbar hyperlordosis gives an impression of a stronger back it can lead to moderate to severe lower back pain The most problematic symptom is that of a herniated disc where the individual has put so much strain on the back that the discs between the vertebrae have been damaged or have ruptured Technical problems with dancing such as difficulty in the positions of attitude and arabesque can be a sign of weak iliopsoas Tightness of the iliopsoas results in a dancer having difficulty lifting their leg into high positions Abdominal muscles being weak and the rectus femoris of the quadriceps being tight are signs that improper muscles are being worked while dancing which leads to lumbar hyperlordosis The most obvious signs of lumbar hyperlordosis is lower back pain in dancing and pedestrian activities as well as having the appearance of a swayed back
Elevated levels of homocysteine have been associated with a number of disease states
Individuals with PNES present with episodes that resemble epileptic seizures and most have received a diagnosis of epilepsy and treatment for it PNES episodes are nearly indistinguishable from epileptic seizures The main differences between a PNES episode and an epileptic seizure is the duration of episodes Epileptic seizures typically last between 30 and 120 seconds depending on the type while PNES episodes typically last for two to five minutes
Combat stress reaction symptoms align with the symptoms also found in psychological trauma which is closely related to post traumatic stress disorder PTSD CSR differs from PTSD among other things in that a PTSD diagnosis requires a duration of symptoms over one month which CSR does not
Vaginal bleeding is a common symptom of gestational choriocarcinoma In the event the gestational choriocarcinoma has already spread to other parts of the body bleeding events in other organs may be the first symptom If the choriocarcinoma has metastasized to the lungs one of the most common organs of metastasis then symptoms may include abnormally quick breathing coughing and chest pain However it is also possible for there to be none of these symptoms and only a difference in biomarkers in an individual instead Uterine enlargement as seen in an ultrasound can be a presenting sign of gestational choriocarcinoma Transvaginal ultrasounds may also be used in screening for the disease with the positron emission tomography PET scan computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI in locations such as the abdomen pelvis and brain being other imaging options Chest x rays may also be used to see if gestational choriocarcinoma has potentially spread to the lungs Human chorionic gonadotropin is a hormone produced by the trophoblast and can be measured in both urine and blood Another option of measuring this biomarker level is through lumbar puncture which can show fluid to serum ratio of human chorionic gonadotropic and reflect whether the disease has potentially spread to the central nervous system Elevated or rising human chorionic gonadotropin can be a sign of gestational choriocarcinoma though it is also used as a biomarker in other types of gestational trophoblastic diseases GTD It is useful not only for diagnosis but also for monitoring disease progression treatment response and potential of recurring gestational choriocarcinoma
There are a variety of symptoms that can occur in children Infants with microcephaly are born with either a normal or reduced head size Subsequently the head fails to grow while the face continues to develop at a normal rate producing a child with a small head and a receding forehead and a loose often wrinkled scalp As the child grows older the smallness of the skull becomes more obvious although the entire body also is often underweight and dwarfed Severely impaired intellectual development is common but disturbances in motor functions may not appear until later in life Affected newborns generally have striking neurological defects and seizures Development of motor functions and speech may be delayed Hyperactivity and intellectual disability are common occurrences although the degree of each varies Convulsions may also occur Motor ability varies ranging from clumsiness in some to spastic quadriplegia in others
The presentation of Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy in an affected individual is as follows Muscle weakness Difficulty walking Contractures predominantly in proximal muscles e g neck Joint looseness predominantly in distal joints
Periapical cysts begin as asymptomatic and progress slowly Subsequent infection of the cyst causes swelling and pain Initially the cyst swells to a round hard protrusion but later on the body resorbs some of the cyst wall leaving a softer accumulation of fluid underneath the mucous membrane Secondary symptoms of periapical cysts include inflammation and infection of the pulp causing dental caries This infection is what causes necrosis of the pulp Larger cysts may cause bone expansion or displace roots Discoloration of the affected tooth may also occur Patient will present negative results to electric and ice test of the affected tooth but will be sensitive to percussion Surrounding gingival tissue may experience lymphadenopathy The alveolar plate may exhibit crepitus when palpated
Neutropenia which may be discovered on routine blood tests typically causes benign infections even when the condition is severe Ear infections otitis media are the most common infection seen in autoimmune neutropenia and typically infection responds to antibiotic treatment alone Infections associated with primary AIN are usually mild and limited including skin infections such as impetigo gastroenteritis upper respiratory tract infections and ear infections Rarely cellulitis and abscesses may occur Studies of children studied for up to six years showed that most cases of autoimmune neutropenia resolved spontaneously after a median of 17 months In 95 percent of patients neutropenia persisted for 7 to 24 months
As a syndrome this condition is poorly defined Diagnostic criteria require one or more antisynthetase antibodies which target tRNA synthetase enzymes and one or more of the following three clinical features interstitial lung disease inflammatory myopathy and inflammatory polyarthritis affecting small joints symmetrically Other supporting features may include fever Raynauds phenomenon and mechanics hands thick cracked skin usually on the palms and radial surfaces of the digits The disease rare as it is is more prevalent in women than in men Early diagnosis is difficult and milder cases may not be detected Also interstitial lung disease may be the only manifestation of the disease Severe disease may develop over time with intermittent relapses
Blood symptoms The characteristic hematological blood effects of copper deficiency are anemia which may be microcytic normocytic or macrocytic and neutropenia Thrombocytopenia low blood platelets is unusual The peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate findings in copper deficiency can mimic myelodysplastic syndrome Bone marrow aspirate in both conditions may show dysplasia of blood cell precursors and the presence of ring sideroblasts erythroblasts containing multiple iron granules around the nucleus Unlike most cases of myelodysplastic syndrome the bone marrow aspirate in copper deficiency characteristically shows cytoplasmic vacuoles within red and white cell precursors and karyotyping in cases of copper deficiency does not reveal cytogenetic features characteristic of myelodysplastic syndrome Anemia and neutropenia typically resolve within six weeks of copper replacement
The X linked varieties of congenital stationary night blindness CSNB can be differentiated from the autosomal forms by the presence of myopia which is typically absent in the autosomal forms Patients with CSNB often have impaired night vision myopia reduced visual acuity strabismus and nystagmus Individuals with the complete form of CSNB CSNB1 have highly impaired rod sensitivity reduced 300x as well as cone dysfunction Patients with the incomplete form can present with either myopia or hyperopia
Lymphangiosarcoma may present as a purple discoloration or a tender skin nodule in the extremity typically on the anterior surface It progresses to an ulcer with crusting to an extensive necrotic focus involving the skin and subcutaneous tissue It metastasizes quickly
Pain is the most notable symptom of vulvodynia and can be characterized as a burning stinging irritation or sharp pain that occurs in the vulva and entrance to the vagina It may be constant intermittent or happen only when the vulva is touched but vulvodynia usually has a long duration Symptoms may occur in one place or the entire vulvar area It can occur during or after sexual activity when tampons are inserted or when prolonged pressure is applied to the vulva such as during sitting bike riding or horseback riding Some cases of vulvodynia are idiopathic where no particular cause can be determined
Asymptomatic lung infection is common with fewer than 5 of infected individuals developing clinical disease It can occur as a mouth and skin type lymphangitic type multi organ involvement type particularly lungs or mixed type If there are mouth ulcers or skin lesions the disease is likely to be widespread There may be no symptoms or it may present with fever sepsis weight loss large glands or a large liver and spleen If there are mouth ulcers or skin lesions the disease is likely to be widespread Two presentations are known firstly the acute or subacute form which predominantly affects children and young adults and the chronic form predominantly affecting adult men Most cases are infected before age 20 although symptoms may present many years later
Depending on the affected gene s this disorder may present symptoms that range from mild to life threatening
Symptoms of hemopericardium often include difficulty breathing abnormally rapid breathing and fatigue each of which can be a sign of a serious medical condition not limited to hemopericardium In many cases patients also report feeling chest pressure and have an abnormally elevated heart rate
Affected individuals may vomit or retch 6 12 times in an hour and an episode may last from a few hours to over three weeks and in some cases months with a median episode duration of 41 hours Stomach acid bile and if the vomiting is severe blood may be vomited Some with the condition will ingest water to reduce the irritation of bile and acid on the esophagus during emesis Between episodes the affected individual is usually normal and healthy otherwise but can be in a weak state of fatigue or experience muscle pain In approximately half of cases the attacks or episodes occur in a time related manner Each attack is stereotypical that is in any given individual the timing frequency and severity of attacks is similar Some affected people experience episodes that progressively get worse when left untreated occurring more frequently with reduced symptom free phase Episodes may happen every few days every few weeks or every few months for some happening at common uniform times typically mornings For other affected people there is not a pattern in time that can be recognized Some with the condition have a warning of an episodic attack they may experience a prodrome some documented prodromal symptoms include unusually intense nausea and pallor excess salivation sweating flushing rapid irregular heartbeat diarrhea anxiety panic food aversion restlessness insomnia irritability depersonalization fatigue listlessness intense feelings of being hot or chilled intense thirst shivering shaking retching tachypnea abdominal pain cramping limb paresthesias hyperesthesia photophobia phonophobia headache and dyspnea heightened sensitivity especially to light though sensitivity to smell sound pressure and temperature as well as oncoming muscle pain and fatigue are also reported by some patients Many experiences a full panic attack when nausea begins and continue to panic once the vomiting has begun Medications like Lorazepam Alprazolam and other benzodiazepines are prescribed by their doctors and instructed to take immediately at the onset of any of their CVS symptoms and or triggers Some prodromal symptoms are present inter episodically as well as during acute phases of illness The majority of affected people can identify triggers that may precede an attack The most common are various foods infections such as colds menstruation extreme physical exertion lack of sleep and psychological stresses both positive and negative An affected person may also be light sensitive photophobic sound sensitive phonophobic or less frequently temperature or pressure sensitive during an attack Some people also have a strong urge to bathe in warm or cold water In fact many people with CVS experience a compulsion to be submerged in hot water and end up taking several baths during the duration of an episode For some the psychological compulsion to be in hot water is so extreme that they cannot stop themselves from taking very long baths in near scalding hot water several times per day For some of these people they may have just finished taking a lengthy bath in extremely hot water and immediately feel this compulsion again and end up taking another bath right after drying off Some people with the condition experience insomnia diarrhea GI complications hot and cold flashes and excessive sweating before an episode Some report that they experience a restless sensation or stinging pain along the spine hands and feet followed by weakness in both legs Some of these symptoms may be due to dehydration or hypokalemia from excessive vomiting rather than the underlying cause of CVS
Symptoms include epigastric pain early satiety fatigue and weight loss Most people affected by primary gastric lymphoma are over 60 years old
The typical onset is at around 55 years old and the symptoms are recurrent hives mostly on the torso and limbs often with recurring fever joint pain bone pain muscle pain headache fatigue and loss of weight
This disorder presents similarly to hyperaldosteronism leading to feedback inhibition of aldosterone Common symptoms include hypertension hypokalemia metabolic alkalosis and low plasma renin activity DOC excess syndrome is an excessive secretion of 21 hydroxyprogesterone also called 11 Deoxycorticosterone from adrenal glands and may cause mineralocorticoid hypertension
NPC may present as a lump or a mass on both sides towards the back of the neck These lumps usually are not tender or painful but appear as a result of the metastatic spread of the cancer to the lymph nodes thus causing the lymph nodes to swell Lymph nodes are defined as glands that function as part of the immune system and can be found throughout the body Swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck is the initial presentation in many people and the diagnosis of NPC is often made by lymph node biopsy Signs of nasopharyngeal cancer may appear as headaches a sore throat and trouble hearing breathing or speaking Additional symptoms of NPC include facial pain or numbness blurred or double vision trouble opening the mouth or recurring ear infections If the ear infection does not present with an upper respiratory tract infection then an examination should be done on the nasopharynx This is due to the fact that in adults ear infections are less common than in children Signs and symptoms related to the primary tumor include trismus pain otitis media nasal regurgitation due to paresis loss of or impaired movement of the soft palate hearing loss and cranial nerve palsy paralysis Larger growths may produce nasal obstruction or bleeding and a nasal twang Metastatic spread may result in bone pain or organ dysfunction Rarely a paraneoplastic syndrome of osteoarthropathy diseases of joints and bones may occur with widespread disease
There are seven major symptoms of Korsakoff syndrome an amnestic confabulatory syndrome anterograde amnesia memory loss for events after the onset of the syndrome retrograde amnesia memory loss extends back for some time before the onset of the syndrome amnesia of fixation also known as fixation amnesia loss of immediate memory a person being unable to remember events of the past few minutes confabulation that is invented memories which are then taken as true due to gaps in memory with such gaps sometimes associated with blackouts minimal content in conversation lack of insight apathy interest in things is quickly lost and there is an indifference to changeBenon R and LeHuché R 1920 described the characteristic signs of Korsakoff syndrome with some additional features including confabulation false memories fixation amnesia paragnosia or false recognition of places mental excitation and euphoria Thiamine is essential for the decarboxylation of pyruvate and deficiency during this metabolic process is thought to cause damage to the medial thalamus and mammillary bodies of the posterior hypothalamus as well as generalized cerebral atrophy These brain regions are all parts of the limbic system which is heavily involved in emotion and memory KS involves neuronal loss that is damage to neurons gliosis which is a result of damage to supporting cells of the central nervous system and bleeding also occurs in mammillary bodies Damage to the medial dorsal nucleus or anterior nuclei of the thalamus limbic specific nuclei is also associated with this disorder Cortical dysfunction may have arisen from thiamine deficiency alcohol neurotoxicity and or structural damage in the diencephalon Originally it was thought that a lack of initiative and a flat affect were important characteristics of emotional presentation in those affected Studies have questioned this proposing that neither is necessarily a symptom of KS Research suggesting that people with Korsakoff syndrome are emotionally unimpaired has made this a controversial topic It can be argued that apathy which is a usual characteristic reflects a deficit of emotional expressions without affecting the experience or perception of emotion KS causes deficits in declarative memory in most people but leaves implicit spatial verbal and procedural memory functioning intact People with KS have deficits in the processing of contextual information Context memories refers to the where and when of experiences and is an essential part of recollection The ability to store and retrieve this information such as spatial location or temporal order information is impaired Research has also suggested that people with Korsakoff syndrome have impaired executive functions which can lead to behavioral problems and interfere with daily activities It is unclear however which executive functions are affected most Nonetheless IQ is usually not affected by the brain damage associated with Korsakoffs syndrome At first it was thought that those with KS used confabulation to fill in memory gaps However it has been found that confabulation and amnesia do not necessarily co occur Studies have shown that there is dissociation between provoked confabulation spontaneous confabulation which is unprovoked and false memories That is people affected could be led to believe certain things had happened which actually had not but so could people without Korsakoff syndrome
The symptoms of CCD are variable but usually involve hypotonia decreased muscle tone at birth mild delay in child development highly variable between cases weakness of the facial muscles and skeletal malformations such as scoliosis and hip dislocation CCD is usually diagnosed in infancy or childhood but some patients remain asymptomatic until adulthood to middle age While generally not progressive there appears to be a growing number of people who do experience a slow clinically significant progression of symptomatology These cases may be due to the large number of mutations of ryanodine receptor malfunction and with continued research may be found to be clinical variants
Signs and symptoms of TIA are widely variable and can mimic other neurologic conditions making the clinical context and physical exam crucial in ruling in or out the diagnosis The most common presenting symptoms of TIA are focal neurologic deficits which can include but are not limited to Amaurosis fugax painless temporary loss of vision One sided facial droop One sided motor weakness Diplopia double vision Problems with balance and spatial orientation or dizziness Visual field deficits such as homonymous hemianopsia or monocular blindness Sensory deficits in one or more limbs and of the face Loss of ability to understand or express speech aphasia Difficulty with articulation of speech dysarthria Unsteady gait Difficulties with swallowing dysphagia Numbness or weakness generally occur on the opposite side of the body from the affected hemisphere of the brain A detailed neurologic exam including a thorough cranial nerve exam is important to identify these findings and to differentiate them from mimickers of TIA Symptoms such as unilateral weakness amaurosis fugax and double vision have higher odds of representing TIA compared to memory loss headache and blurred vision Below is a table of symptoms at presentation and what percentage of the time they are seen in TIAs versus conditions that mimic TIA In general focal deficits make TIA more likely but the absence of focal findings do not exclude the diagnosis and further evaluation may be warranted if clinical suspicion for TIA is high see Diagnosis section below
First signs or symptoms can occur about three to six days after the initial tick bite although it can have incubation periods of up to 20 days Patients usually experience a two staged fever and illness which can continue for three days diminish and then return for another episode of one to three days The virus has the ability to live in the bloodstream for up to 120 days therefore coming in contact without proper precautions and the donation of blood are prohibited Initial symptoms include fever chills headaches pain behind the eyes light sensitivity muscle pain generalized malaise abdominal pain hepatosplenomegaly nausea and vomiting and a flat or pimply rash During the second phase of the virus a high fever can return with an increase in symptoms CTF can be very severe in cases involving children and can even require hospitalization Complications with this disease have included aseptic meningitis encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever but these are rare CTF is seasonal mostly occurring in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States and usually in altitudes from 4 000 to 10 000 feet 1 600 to 3 000 meters Patients with CTF are mostly campers and young males who most likely have been bitten because of their activities
Symptoms Patients experiencing indigestion likely report one a combination of or all of the following symptoms upper abdominal pain or discomfort bloating early satiety postprandial fullness nausea with or without vomiting anorexia regurgitation belching
Sydenhams chorea is characterized by the abrupt onset sometimes within a few hours of neurologic symptoms classically chorea which are non rhythmic writhing or explosive involuntary movements Usually all four limbs are affected but there are cases reported where just one side of the body is affected hemichorea Typical chorea includes repeated wrist hyperextension grimacing lip pouting The fingers can move as if playing the piano There may be tongue fasciculations bag of worms and motor impersistence for example the milk maid sign grip strength fluctuates as if hand milking or inability to sustain tongue protrusion or eye closure There is usually loss of fine motor control particularly obvious in handwriting if the child is of school age Speech is often affected dysarthria as is walking legs will suddenly give way or flick out to one side giving an irregular gait and the appearance of skipping or dancing Underlying the abnormal movements is often low tone hypotonia which may not become obvious until treatment is started to suppress the chorea In severe cases the loss of tone and weakness predominate chorea paralyticum The severity of the condition can vary from just some instability on walking and difficulty with hand writing to the extreme of being wholly unable to walk talk or eat Movements cease during sleep The eye muscles are not affected curiously It is a neuropsychiatric disorder so besides the motor problems there is classically emotional lability mood swings or inappropriate mood anxiety attention deficit These can precede the motor symptoms Non neurologic manifestations of acute rheumatic fever may be present namely carditis up to 70 of cases often subclinical so echocardiography required arthritis erythema marginatum and subcutaneous nodules
Signs and symptoms include for each of the following causes
The phenotype of CdLS is highly varied and is described as a spectrum from Classic CdLS with a greater number of key features to mild variations with only a few features Some people will have a small number of features but dont have CdLS Key features
There may or may not be any evidence of history of HGF in the family nor any usage of taking long term medicines for any particular disease when it comes to diagnosing HGF There also may or may not be any signs of medical and or family history of mental retardation hypertrichosis nor clinical symptoms that can be associated with gingival enlargement Although enlargement of gingiva interdental papilla hindered speech and secondary inflammatory changes taking place in the mouth commonly at the marginal gingiva are all very indicative of this condition Commonly the patient will have mandibular and maxilliary inflammation and overgrowth as opposed to the traditional pink firm and fleshy consistency of healthy gingiva The patients jaw may also appear distorted because of the gingiva enlargements Overgrowth of the gingiva can range from slightly covering the surface of teeth or it can even completely cover the surrounding teeth The patient can also experience damage or loss of teeth
Affected individuals may not have symptoms in some cases Symptomatic individuals present with symptoms identical to those of patients who are on thiazide diuretics given that the affected transporter is the exact target of thiazides unlike in Bartter syndrome in which patients present as though on loop diuretics Clinical signs of Gitelman syndrome include a high blood pH in combination with low levels of chloride potassium and magnesium in the blood and decreased calcium excretion in the urine In contrast to people with Gordons syndrome those affected by Gitelman syndrome generally have low or normal blood pressure Individuals affected by Gitelman syndrome often complain of severe muscle cramps or weakness numbness thirst waking up at night to urinate salt cravings abnormal sensations chondrocalcinosis or weakness expressed as extreme fatigue or irritability Though cravings for salt are most common and severe cravings for sour foods e g vinegar lemons and sour figs have been noted in some persons affected More severe symptoms such as seizures tetany and paralysis have been reported Abnormal heart rhythms and a prolonged QT interval can be detected on electrocardiogram and cases of sudden cardiac death have been reported due to low potassium levels Quality of life is decreased in Gitelman syndromePhenotypic variations observed among patients probably result from differences in their genetic background and may depend on which particular amino acid in the NCCT protein has been mutated A study by Riviera Munoz et al identified a subset of individuals with Gitelman syndrome with a severe phenotypic expression The clinical manifestations observed in this group were neuromuscular manifestations growth retardation and ventricular arrhythmias The patients were mostly male and were found to have at least one allele of a splice defect on the SLC12A3 gene
Individuals affected by this disorder appear normal at birth As the infant grows however their arms and legs do not develop properly and their body becomes thicker and shorter than normal The following are characteristics consistent with this condition Brachydactyly Short stature Micromelia Skeletal dysplasia Abnormality of femur
Myofascial pain is pain in muscles or fascia a type of connective tissue that surrounds muscles It can occur in distinct isolated areas of the body Because any muscle or fascia in the body may be affected this may cause a variety of localized symptoms Generally speaking the muscular pain is steady aching and deep Depending on the case and location the intensity can range from mild discomfort to excruciating and lightning like Knots may be visible or felt beneath the skin The pain does not resolve on its own even after typical first aid self care such as ice heat and rest Myofascial pain syndromes are characterized by localized pain in an area of repetitive use or trauma with resultant trigger points that cause non dermatomal pain radiation upon palpation Autonomic dysfunction and spontaneous EMG activity can be seen in the affected region
Withdrawal effects caused by sedative hypnotics discontinuation such as benzodiazepines barbiturates or alcohol can cause serious medical complications They are cited to be more hazardous to withdraw from than opioids Users typically receive little advice and support for discontinuation Some withdrawal symptoms are identical to the symptoms for which the medication was originally prescribed and can be acute or protracted in duration Onset of symptoms from long half life benzodiazepines might be delayed for up to three weeks although withdrawal symptoms from short acting ones often present early usually within 24 48 hours There may be no fundamental differences in symptoms from either high or low dose discontinuation but symptoms tend to be more severe from higher doses Daytime reemergence and rebound withdrawal symptoms sometimes confused with interdose withdrawal may occur once dependence has set in Reemergence is the return of symptoms for which the drug was initially prescribed in contrast rebound symptoms are a return of the symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was initially taken but at a more intense level than before whereas interdose withdrawal is when a prior dosage of drug wears off and beginnings of an entirely new cycle of withdrawal sets in the symptoms of which dissipate upon taking the next dosage but after which yet another entirely new cycle of withdrawal begins when that dosage wears off a new onset of withdrawal between each dosage thus called interdose withdrawal and if not properly treated can recur indefinitely in a vicious circle for which a benzo with a long half life e g diazepam can be substituted so the drug does not wear off between doses Withdrawal symptoms may appear for the first time during dose reduction and include insomnia anxiety distress weight loss dizziness night sweats shakes muscle twitches aphasia panic attacks depression derealization paranoia indigestion diarrhea photophobia etc and are more commonly associated with short acting benzodiazepines discontinuation like triazolam Daytime symptoms can occur after a few days to a few weeks of administration of nightly benzodiazepines or z drugs such as zopiclone withdrawal related insomnia rebounds worse than baseline and for rapidly eliminated benzodiazepines including triazolam and temazepam this may occur even when used briefly and intermittently according to a small 1991 study n 18 The following symptoms may emerge during gradual or abrupt dosage reduction
Warthins tumor primarily affects older individuals age 60 70 years There is a slight male predilection according to recent studies The tumor is slow growing painless and usually appears in the tail of the parotid gland near the angle of the mandible In 5 14 of cases Warthins tumor is bilateral but the two masses usually are at different times Warthins tumor is highly unlikely to become malignant
Symptoms may include coughing an upper respiratory tract infection shortness of breath and chest pain These symptoms are very non specific and can be caused by other types of tumor in the lung or mediastinum more generally and by other conditions Imaging X ray CT MRI may be used to determine the presence and precise location of a tumor but not a specific diagnosis of PPB or other tumor Doctors are unable to tell if a child has PPB right away and not upper respiratory tract infection until more test are taken and they show that there is no infection Another symptom is pneumothorax
The major symptom and signs include an acute onset of right upper quadrant RUQ abdominal pain aggravated by breathing coughing or laughing which may be referred to the right shoulder There is usually also tenderness on palpation of the right upper abdomen and tenderness to percussion of the lower ribs which protect the liver Surprisingly there is often no or only minimal pelvic pain vaginal discharge or cervical motion tenderness which may lead to the diagnosis being missed This may be due to infectious bacteria bypassing pelvic structures on the way to the liver capsule
As with several other metabolic conditions OTC deficiency can have variable presentations regarding age of onset and the severity of symptoms This compounded when considering heterozygous females and the possibility of non random X inactivation In the classic and most well known presentation a male infant appears well initially but by the second day of life they are irritable lethargic and stop feeding A metabolic encephalopathy develops and this can progress to coma and death without treatment Ammonia is only toxic to the brain other tissues can handle elevated ammonia concentrations without problems Later onset forms of OTC deficiency can have variable presentations Although late onset forms of the disease are often considered milder than the classic infantile presentation any affected individual is at risk for an episode of hyperammonemia that could still be life threatening if presented with the appropriate stressors These patients will often present with headaches nausea vomiting delayed growth and a variety of psychiatric symptoms confusion delirium aggression or self injury A detailed dietary history of an affected individual with undiagnosed OTC deficiency will often reveal a history of protein avoidance The prognosis of a patient with severe OTC deficiency is well correlated with the length of the hyperammonemic period rather than the degree of hyperammonemia or the presence of other symptoms such as seizures Even for patients with late onset forms of the disease their overall clinical picture is dependent on the extent of hyperammonemia they have experienced even if it has remained unrecognized
Cause The exact cause of the disorder is unknown but it is believed to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner
Frequent chronic epistaxis or blood tinged nasal discharge Nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea Facial dysmorphism when locally invasive Conductive hearing loss from eustachian tube obstruction Diplopia which occurs secondary to erosion into superior orbital fissure and due to third and sixth nerve palsy Proptosis when having intraorbital extension Rarely anosmia recurrent otitis media and eye pain
The most detailed study on the frequency onset and duration of MVD clinical signs and symptoms was performed during the 1998 2000 mixed MARV RAVV disease outbreak A maculopapular rash petechiae purpura ecchymoses and hematomas especially around needle injection sites are typical hemorrhagic manifestations However contrary to popular belief hemorrhage does not lead to hypovolemia and is not the cause of death total blood loss is minimal except during labor Instead death occurs due to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome MODS due to fluid redistribution hypotension disseminated intravascular coagulation and focal tissue necroses Clinical phases of Marburg Hemorrhagic Fevers presentation are described below Note that phases overlap due to variability between cases
The hallmark sign of sarcopenia is loss of lean muscle mass or muscle atrophy The change in body composition may be difficult to detect due to obesity changes in fat mass or edema Changes in weight limb or waist circumference are not reliable indicators of muscle mass changes Sarcopenia may also cause reduced strength functional decline and increased risk of falling Sarcopenia may also have no symptoms until it is severe and is often unrecognized Research has shown however that hypertrophy may occur in the upper parts of the body to compensate for this loss of lean muscle mass Therefore one early indicator of the onset of sarcopenia can be significant loss of muscle mass in the anterior thigh and abdominal muscles
Signs and symptoms depend largely upon the primary lesions giving rise to the condition In addition to the heart or lung symptoms there will be a sense of fullness and tenderness in the right hypochondriac region Gastrointestinal catarrh is usually present and vomiting of blood may occur There is usually more or less jaundice Owing to portal obstruction ascites occurs followed later by generalised oedema The stools are light or clay colored and the urine is colored by bile On palpation the liver is found enlarged and tender sometimes extending several inches below the costal margin of the ribs
Type 1 tyrosinemia typically presents in infancy as failure to thrive and hepatomegaly The primary effects are progressive liver and kidney dysfunction The liver disease causes cirrhosis conjugated hyperbilirubinemia elevated AFP hypoglycemia and coagulation abnormalities This can lead to jaundice ascites and hemorrhage There is also an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma The kidney dysfunction presents as Fanconi syndrome Renal tubular acidosis hypophosphatemia and aminoaciduria Cardiomyopathy neurologic and dermatologic manifestations are also possible The urine has an odor of cabbage or rancid butter The presentation of symptoms of tyrosinemia type 1 in terms of timing is broken into three categories acute sub acute and chronic The acute classification typically is presented clinically between birth and 6 months of age The common presentation in an acute case is synthetic liver failure marked by the lack of formation of coagulation factors in blood Patients are prone to infections at this stage accompanied by fever vomiting increased tendency to bleed and diarrhea along with bloody feces as manifestations of sepsis Other symptoms include enlarged liver jaundice and excess abdominal fluid Sub acute cases present between 6 months and the first year of life and the severity of liver disease is lessened to an extent Again synthetic function of the liver in terms of blood coagulation factors is impaired in addition to enlargement of the liver and spleen The infant may also display a failure to thrive as their growth is limited by the disease This growth impairment can manifest itself in rickets which is the softening of bones The final classification chronic HT1 is detected with presentations occurring after one year of life The course of the disease up to this point can lead to different ailments affecting the liver Cirrhosis liver failure or cancer of the liver may present as a result of chronic liver disease Additional symptoms common in this classification include cardiomyopathy renal disease and acute neurological crises
African tick bite fever is often asymptomatic or mild in clinical presentation and complications are rare The onset of illness is typically 5 7 days after the tick bite although in some cases it may take up to 10 days for symptoms to occur Symptoms can persist for several days to up to three weeks Common presenting symptoms include
Symptomatic choline deficiency is rare in humans Most obtain sufficient amounts of it from the diet and are able to biosynthesize limited amounts of it Symptomatic deficiency is often caused by certain diseases or by other indirect causes Severe deficiency causes muscle damage and non alcoholic fatty liver disease which may develop into cirrhosis Besides humans fatty liver is also a typical sign of choline deficiency in other animals Bleeding in the kidneys can also occur in some species This is suspected to be due to deficiency of choline derived trimethylglycine which functions as an osmoregulator
Subacromial bursitis often presents with a constellation of symptoms called impingement syndrome Pain along the front and side of the shoulder is the most common symptom and may cause weakness and stiffness If the pain resolves and weakness persists other causes should be evaluated such as a tear of the rotator cuff or a neurological problem arising from the neck or entrapment of the suprascapular nerve The onset of pain may be sudden or gradual and may or may not be related to trauma Night time pain especially sleeping on the affected shoulder is often reported Localized redness or swelling are less common and suggest an infected subacromial bursa Individuals affected by subacromial bursitis commonly present with concomitant shoulder problems such as arthritis rotator cuff tendinitis rotator cuff tears and cervical radiculopathy pinched nerve in neck Impingement may be brought on by sports activities such as overhead throwing sports and swimming or overhead work such as painting carpentry or plumbing Activities that involve repetitive overhead activity or directly in front may cause shoulder pain Direct upward pressure on the shoulder such as leaning on an elbow may increase pain
The five symptoms associated with achromatopsia are
The Harlequin sign is unilateral flushing and sweating of the face neck and upper chest usually after exposure to heat or strenuous exertion Horner syndrome another problem associated with the sympathetic nervous system is often seen in conjunction with harlequin syndrome Since Harlequin syndrome is associated with a dysfunction in the autonomic nervous system main symptoms of this dysfunction are in the following Absence of sweat anhidrosis and flushing on one side of the face neck or upper thoracic area In addition other symptoms include cluster headaches tearing of the eyes nasal discharge abnormal contraction of the pupils weakness in neck muscles and drooping of one side of the upper eyelid
Acute cerebellar ataxia usually follows 2 3 weeks after an infection Onset is abrupt Vomiting may be present at the onset but fever and nuchal rigidity characteristically are absent Horizontal nystagmus is present in approximately 50 of cases
All people with ALPS have signs of lymphoproliferation which makes it the most common clinical manifestation of the disease The increased proliferation of lymphoid cells can cause the size of lymphoid organs such as the lymph nodes and spleen to increase lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly present in respectively over 90 and over 80 of patients The liver is enlarged hepatomegaly in 30 40 of patients Autoimmune disease is the second most common clinical manifestation and one that most often requires treatment The most common autoimmune presentations include autoimmune cytopenias which can be mild to very severe and intermittent or chronic These include autoimmune hemolytic anemia autoimmune neutropenia and autoimmune thrombocytopenia Other autoimmune manifestations can be similar to systemic lupus erythematosus least common affecting 5 of patients Manifestations within the nervous system can include autoimmune cerebellar ataxia Guillain Barré syndrome and transverse myelitis Manifestations in the gastrointestinal system can include atrophic gastritis and autoimmune hepatitis esophagitis colitis and pancreatitis Other manifestations can affect the skin hives lungs bronchiolitis obliterans or kidneys autoimmune glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome Another sign are cancers such as Hodgkin and non Hodgkin lymphomas which appear to be increased possibly due to Epstein Barr virus encoded RNA positivity Some carcinomas may occur Unaffected family members with genetic mutations are also at an increased risk of developing cancer
The most common presentation is a single large deep ulcer although several smaller ulcers may occur in the internal surface of one or both labia minora The labia majora may be affected as may the vagina and urethra The ulcer develops very quickly and is usually preceded by sudden onset of fever and malaise
Disease presentation varies widely from patient to patient as UCTD is by definition nonspecific Symptoms typically include constitutional complaints that are common to connective tissue diseases such as fatigue a general sense of feeling unwell and fever Other symptoms associated with UCTD include dry eyes dry mouth hair loss joint inflammation joint pain oral ulcers positive ANA test raynauds phenomenon sun sensitive rashClinical presentation in some people diagnosed with UCTD may show a decrease in white blood cell count in the blood anemia abnormal nerve sensations in the extremities inflammation of the lining of the heart and or lungs a decrease in platelet countLung involvement such as nonspecific interstitial pneumonia is a possible disease complication
Symptoms of Moorens ulcer can include Pain in the affected eye s Redness of the affected eye s Progressive ulceration of the cornea Blurred vision Photophobia TearingSome epidemiological studies have noted that men tend to be affected more than women
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC recommends these criteria for diagnosis Greatly lowered ability to do activities that were usual before the illness This drop in activity level occurs along with fatigue and must last six months or longer Worsening of symptoms after physical or mental activity that would not have caused a problem before the illness The amount of activity that might aggravate the illness is difficult for a person to predict and the decline often presents 12 to 48 hours after the activity The relapse or crash may last days weeks or longer This is known as post exertional malaise PEM Sleep problems people may still feel weary after full nights of sleep or may struggle to stay awake fall asleep or stay asleep Additionally one of the following symptoms must be present Problems with thinking and memory cognitive dysfunction sometimes described as brain fog While standing or sitting upright lightheadedness dizziness weakness fainting or vision changes may occur orthostatic intolerance
Current consensus is that atypical anorexia patients are at risk for the same medical complications of anorexia nervosa Evidence from a study conducted at the University of California San Francisco Eating Disorders Program suggests that atypical anorexia patients are equally likely as anorexia nervosa patients to develop secondary side effects including bradycardia decreased heart rate amenorrhea stopping of the menstrual period and electrolyte imbalances
Signs and symptoms of a peptic ulcer can include one or more of the following abdominal pain classically epigastric strongly correlated with mealtimes In case of duodenal ulcers the pain appears about three hours after taking a meal and wakes the person from sleep bloating and abdominal fullness waterbrash a rush of saliva after an episode of regurgitation to dilute the acid in esophagus although this is more associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease nausea and copious vomiting loss of appetite and weight loss in gastric ulcer weight gain in duodenal ulcer as the pain is relieved by eating hematemesis vomiting of blood this can occur due to bleeding directly from a gastric ulcer or from damage to the esophagus from severe continuing vomiting melena tarry foul smelling feces due to presence of oxidized iron from hemoglobin rarely an ulcer can lead to a gastric or duodenal perforation which leads to acute peritonitis and extreme stabbing pain and requires immediate surgery A history of heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD and use of certain medications can raise the suspicion for peptic ulcer Medicines associated with peptic ulcer include NSAIDs non steroid anti inflammatory drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase and most glucocorticoids e g dexamethasone and prednisolone In people over the age of 45 with more than two weeks of the above symptoms the odds for peptic ulceration are high enough to warrant rapid investigation by esophagogastroduodenoscopy The timing of symptoms in relation to the meal may differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers A gastric ulcer would give epigastric pain during the meal associated with nausea and vomiting as gastric acid production is increased as food enters the stomach Pain in duodenal ulcers would be aggravated by hunger and relieved by a meal and is associated with night pain Also the symptoms of peptic ulcers may vary with the location of the ulcer and the persons age Furthermore typical ulcers tend to heal and recur and as a result the pain may occur for few days and weeks and then wane or disappear Usually children and the elderly do not develop any symptoms unless complications have arisen A burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach area lasting between 30 minutes and 3 hours commonly accompanies ulcers This pain can be misinterpreted as hunger indigestion or heartburn Pain is usually caused by the ulcer but it may be aggravated by the stomach acid when it comes into contact with the ulcerated area The pain caused by peptic ulcers can be felt anywhere from the navel up to the sternum it may last from few minutes to several hours and it may be worse when the stomach is empty Also sometimes the pain may flare at night and it can commonly be temporarily relieved by eating foods that buffer stomach acid or by taking anti acid medication However peptic ulcer disease symptoms may be different for everyone
Rhinoscleroma has been divided into 3 stages catarrhal atrophic granulomatous and sclerotic stages The catarrhal stage begins with a nonspecific rhinitis which progresses into purulent fetid rhinorrhea and crusting which can last for weeks or even months The granulomatous stage results in the development of a bluish red nasal mucosa and the development of intranasal rubbery nodules or polyps Nose bleeds nasal deformity and destruction of the nasal cartilage are also noted Hebra nose The damage may result in anesthesia of the soft palate enlargement of the uvula dysphonia and various degrees of airway obstruction The fibrotic stage is characterized by sclerosis and fibrosis Lymphadenitis is absent
Incubation period is usually two to three weeks The most common manifestation is flu like symptoms abrupt onset of fever malaise profuse perspiration severe headache muscle pain joint pain loss of appetite upper respiratory problems dry cough pleuritic pain chills confusion and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea vomiting and diarrhea About half of infected individuals exhibit no symptoms During its course the disease can progress to an atypical pneumonia which can result in a life threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome whereby such symptoms usually occur during the first four to five days of infection Less often Q fever causes granulomatous hepatitis which may be asymptomatic or become symptomatic with malaise fever liver enlargement and pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen Whereas transaminase values are often elevated jaundice is uncommon Retinal vasculitis is a rare manifestation of Q fever The chronic form of Q fever is virtually identical to endocarditis i e inflammation of the inner lining of the heart which can occur months or decades following the infection It is usually fatal if untreated However with appropriate treatment the mortality falls to around 10
Hallucinations A hallucination is defined as sensory perception in the absence of external stimuli Hallucinations are different from illusions and perceptual distortions which are the misperception of external stimuli Hallucinations may occur in any of the senses and take on almost any form They may consist of simple sensations such as lights colors sounds tastes or smells or more detailed experiences such as seeing and interacting with animals and people hearing voices and having complex tactile sensations Hallucinations are generally characterized as being vivid and uncontrollable Auditory hallucinations particularly experiences of hearing voices are the most common and often prominent feature of psychosis Up to 15 of the general population may experience auditory hallucinations though not all are due to psychosis The prevalence of auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia is generally put around 70 but may go as high as 98 Reported prevalence in bipolar disorder ranges between 11 and 68 During the early 20th century auditory hallucinations were second to visual hallucinations in frequency but they are now the most common manifestation of schizophrenia although rates vary between cultures and regions Auditory hallucinations are most commonly intelligible voices When voices are present the average number has been estimated at three Content like frequency differs significantly especially across cultures and demographics People who experience auditory hallucinations can frequently identify the loudness location of origin and may settle on identities for voices Western cultures are associated with auditory experiences concerning religious content frequently related to sin Hallucinations may command a person to do something potentially dangerous when combined with delusions So called minor hallucinations such as extracampine hallucinations or false perceptions of people or movement occurring outside of ones visual field frequently occur in neurocognitive disorders such as Parkinsons disease Visual hallucinations occur in roughly a third of people with schizophrenia although rates as high as 55 are reported The prevalence in bipolar disorder is around 15 Content commonly involves animate objects although perceptual abnormalities such as changes in lighting shading streaks or lines may be seen Visual abnormalities may conflict with proprioceptive information and visions may include experiences such as the ground tilting Lilliputian hallucinations are less common in schizophrenia and are more common in various types of encephalopathy such as peduncular hallucinosis A visceral hallucination also called a cenesthetic hallucination is characterized by visceral sensations in the absence of stimuli Cenesthetic hallucinations may include sensations of burning or re arrangement of internal organs
Often every joint in a patient with arthrogryposis is affected in 84 all limbs are involved in 11 only the legs and in 4 only the arms are involved Every joint in the body when affected displays typical signs and symptoms for example the shoulder internal rotation wrist volar and ulnar hand fingers in fixed flexion and thumb in palm hip flexed abducted and externally rotated frequently dislocated elbow extension and pronation and foot clubfoot and less commonly congenital vertical talus Range of motion can be different between joints because of the different deviations Some types of arthrogryposis like amyoplasia have a symmetrical joint limb involvement with normal sensations The contractures in the joints can result in delayed walking development in the first five years but severity of contractures do not necessarily predict eventual walking ability or inability Intelligence is normal to above normal in children with amyoplasia but it is not known how many of these children have an above normal intelligence and there is no literature available about the cause of this syndrome There are a few syndromes like the Freeman Sheldon and Gordon syndrome which have craniofacial involvement The amyoplasia form of arthrogryposis is sometimes accompanied with a midline facial hemangioma Arthrogryposis is not a diagnosis but a clinical finding so this disease is often accompanied with other syndromes or diseases These other diagnoses could affect any organ in a patient There are a few slightly more common diagnoses such as pulmonary hypoplasia cryptorchidism congenital heart defects tracheoesophageal fistulas inguinal hernias cleft palate and eye abnormalities
Initially TBM may be asymptomatic or some patients do not experience symptoms at all In a progressive TBM case symptoms include
The common symptoms of neutropenia are recurrent fever malaise inflammation of the tissues surrounding the teeth mouth ulcers inflammation and bacterial infection of the respiratory tract digestive tract skin and abdominal pain It is considered that the greatest risk for death is from developing necrotizing enterocolitis NEC peritonitis bacteremia or Clostridium and Escherichia coli sepsis and septic shock and pneumonia
Over the past 30 years several studies have found that those affected by NSRED all have different symptoms and behaviors specific to them yet they also all have similar characteristics that doctors and psychologists have identified to distinguish NSRED from other combinations of sleep and eating disorders such as night eating syndrome Winkelman says that typical behaviors for patients with NSRED include Partial arousals from sleep usually within 2 to 3 hours of sleep onset and subsequent ingestion of food in a rapid or out of control manner They also will attempt to eat bizarre amalgamations of foods and even potentially harmful substances such as glue wood or other toxic materials In addition Schenck and Mahowald noted that their patients mainly ate sweets pastas both hot and cold meals improper substances such as raw frozen or spoiled foods salt or sugar sandwiches buttered cigarettes and odd mixtures prepared in a blender During the handling of this food patients with NSRED distinguish themselves as they are usually messy or harmful to themselves Some eat their food with their bare hands while others attempt to eat it with utensils This occasionally results in injuries to the person as well as other injuries After completing their studies Schenck and Mahowald said Injuries resulted from the careless cutting of food or opening of cans consumption of scalding fluids coffee or solids hot oatmeal and frenzied running into walls kitchen counters and furniture A few of the more notable symptoms of this disorder include large amounts of weight gain over short periods of time particularly in women irritability during the day due to lack of restful sleep and vivid dreams at night It is easily distinguished from regular sleepwalking by the typical behavioral sequence consisting of rapid automatic arising from bed and immediate entry into the kitchen In addition throughout all of the studies done doctors and psychiatrists discovered that these symptoms are invariant across weekdays weekends and vacations as well as the eating excursions being erratically spread throughout a sleep cycle Most people with this disease retain no control over when they arise and consume food in their sleep Although some have been able to restrain themselves from indulging in their unconscious appetites some have not and must turn to alternative methods of stopping this disorder It is important for trained physicians to recognize these symptoms in their patients as quickly as possible so those with NSRED may be treated before they injure themselves
The general presentation is of a skin covered nodule papule or nodule of the skin surface usually immediately anterior to the auricle However it may be anywhere within the periauricular tissues Bilateral presentation can be seen
Most people are diagnosed as having CLL based on the result of a routine blood test that shows a high white blood cell count specifically a large increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes These people generally have no symptoms Less commonly CLL may present with enlarged lymph nodes If enlarged lymph nodes are caused by infiltrating CLL type cells a diagnosis of small lymphocytic lymphoma SLL is made Less commonly the disease comes to light only after the cancerous cells overwhelm the bone marrow resulting in low red blood cells neutrophils or platelets Or there is fever night sweats weight loss and the person feels tired CLL can be grouped with small lymphocytic lymphoma SLL as one disease with two clinical presentations Wherein with CLL diseased cells propagate from within the bone marrow in SLL they propagate from within the lymphatic tissue CLLs are in virtually all cases preceded by a particular subtype of monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis MBL This subtype termed chronic lymphocytic leukemia type MBL CLL type MBL is an asymptomatic indolent and chronic disorder in which people exhibit a mild increase in the number of circulating B cell lymphocytes These B cells are abnormal they are monoclonal i e produced by a single ancestral B cell and have some of the same cell marker proteins chromosome abnormalities and gene mutations found in CLL CLL SLL MBL consist of two groups low count CLL SLL MBL has monoclonal B cell blood counts of 0 5x9 cells liter i e 0 5x9 L while high count CLL SLL MBL has blood monoclonal B cell counts 0 5x9 L but 5x109 L Individuals with blood counts of these monoclonal B cells 5x9 L are diagnosed as having CLL Low count CLL SLL MBL rarely if ever progresses to CLL while high count CLL SLL MBL does so at a rate of 1 2 per year Thus CLL may present in individuals with a long history of having high count CLL SLL MBL There is no established treatment for these individuals except monitoring for development of the disorders various complications see treatment of MBL complications and for their progression to CLL
This is an X linked condition affecting males more than females and is characterized by postnatal growth failure with developmental delays and dysmorphic features characterized by wrinkled forehead anterior and posterior fontanels prominent eyes large down slanting palpebral fissures thickened or hooded eyelids large ears flared nares hypoplastic alae nasi short columella protruding upper lip and microretrognathia There is also delayed closing of fontanelle and the boys also have broad great toes Skin is characterized by redundancy or laxity with minimal subcutaneous fat cutaneous capillary malformations and very fine hair and eyebrows Death resulted from cardiogenic shock following arrhythmia which was noted in all affected individuals The boys had heart rhythm abnormalities and craniofacial abnormalities which accounted for their similar appearance The boys were never able to sit up on their own and none learned how to talk They all had a characteristically aged appearance earning them the family nickname of little old men Several of the boys had structural anomalies of their hearts including ventricular septal defect atrial septal defect and pulmonary artery stenosis Events recorded on electrocardiogram before death included torsades de pointes premature ventricular contraction PVC premature atrial contraction PAC supraventricular tachycardia SVtach and ventricular tachycardia Vtach Most of the children had inguinal hernias and the majority had at least unilateral cryptorchidism All had neonatal hypotonia progressing to hypertonia and cerebral atrophy on MRI several but not all had neurogenic scoliosis Death occurred prior to two years in all cases and prior to one year in the majority There are extensive clinical details for each child reported in the original publication
The claimed symptoms of chromium deficiency caused by long term total parenteral nutrition are severely impaired glucose tolerance weight loss peripheral neuropathy and confusion
Pediatric patients usually present with acute onset of hemolytic anemia with fatigue exercise intolerance pallor jaundice and hemoglobinuria preceded by exposure to cold temperature and preceding viral like illness This may be complicated by acute renal failure due to nephrotoxic free hemoglobin and tubular obstruction Although the disease may be fulminant during onset the acute form generally follows a transient self limiting course Chronic relapsing PCH manifests as episodic hemoglobinuria and anemic symptoms usually milder than the acute form While the classical syphilitic PCH becomes infrequent paraneoplastic cause with underlying hematological malignancies especially in the elderly should be considered Hepatosplenomegaly and adenomegaly are not pertinent to PCH unless associated with underlying lymphoproliferative disorders This form remains refractory if the underlying condition is not treated
Humans Demodicosis in humans is usually caused by Demodex folliculorum and may have a rosacea like appearance Common symptoms include hair loss itching and inflammation An association with pityriasis folliculorum has also been described Demodicosis is most often seen in folliculitis inflammation of the hair follicles of the skin Depending on the location it may result in small pustules pimples at the base of a hair shaft on inflamed congested skin Demodicosis may also cause itching swelling and erythema of the eyelid margins Scales at the base of the eyelashes may develop Typically patients complain of eyestrain
Cebocephaly causes
The presentation of shock is variable with some people having only minimal symptoms such as confusion and weakness While the general signs for all types of shock are low blood pressure decreased urine output and confusion these may not always be present While a fast heart rate is common those on β blockers those who are athletic and in 30 of cases of those with shock due to intra abdominal bleeding heart rate may be normal or slow Specific subtypes of shock may have additional symptoms Dry mucous membrane reduced skin turgor prolonged capillary refill time weak peripheral pulses and cold extremities can be early signs of shock
Symptoms of UARS are similar to those of obstructive sleep apnea but not inherently overlapping Fatigue insomnia daytime sleepiness unrefreshing sleep anxiety and frequent awakenings during sleep are the most common symptoms Oxygen desaturation is minimal or absent in UARS with most having a minimum oxygen saturation 92 Many patients experience chronic insomnia that creates both a difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep As a result patients typically experience frequent sleep disruptions Most patients with UARS snore but not all Some patients experience hypotension which may cause lightheadedness and patients with UARS are also more likely to experience headaches and irritable bowel syndrome Predisposing factors include a high and narrow hard palate an abnormally small intermolar distance an abnormal overjet greater than or equal to 3 millimeters and a thin soft palatal mucosa with a short uvula In 88 of the subjects there is a history of early extraction or absence of wisdom teeth There is an increased prevalence of UARS in east Asians
Clinical signs include redness of the eye pain blurring of vision photophobia and floaters However some individuals particularly children can present with few to no symptoms
The following is a list of common signs and symptoms of neonatal meningitis Fever poor appetite anterior fontanelle bulging seizures jitteriness dyspnea irritability anorexia vomiting diarrhea abdominal distention increase in abdominal size neck rigidity cyanosis jaundice sunset eyes downward gaze of the eyes abnormal body temperature hypo or hyperthermia change of activity lethargy or irritability These symptoms are unspecific and may point to many different conditions
Autoimmune hypophysitis can lead to deficiencies in one or more pituitary hormones causing central diabetes insipidus if the posterior pituitary gland is affected as well as central adrenal insufficiency and central hypothyroidism if the anterior pituitary gland is affected The symptoms depend on what part of the pituitary is affected Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis LAH occurs when the anterior pituitary cells are affected by autoimmune inflammation resulting in either no symptoms adrenal insufficiency if the ACTH producing cells are affected hypothyroidism if the TSH producing cells are damaged or hypogonadism if the LH and or FSH producing cells are involved In some cases the presence of inflammation within the pituitary gland leads to interruption of dopamine flow from the hypothalamus into the pituitary causing high levels of the hormone prolactin and often as a consequence milk production from the breasts in older girls and women Lymphocytic Infundibuloneurohypophysitis LINH occurs when the posterior pituitary is affected resulting in diabetes insipidus Both LAH and LINH may also lead to symptoms of an intracranial mass such as headache or disturbance of vision i e bitemporal hemianopia The pituitary produces multiple hormones relating to various metabolic functions Sufficiently low production of certain pituitary hormones can be fatal resulting in the failure of the thyroid or adrenal glands Common symptoms include nausea vomiting fatigue loss of libido amenorrhea and dizziness It is estimated that typically it takes from 12 to 40 years for autoimmune destruction to present symptoms However there have been cases of isolated attacks as a result of drug reactions i e use of blocking antibody ipilimumab or idiopathic events that have presented symptoms which may disappear after relatively short term treatment i e 1 year on corticoids or other immune suppressants However more rapid development of the disorder is the rule when it occurs during or shortly after pregnancy even after miscarriage or abortion Indeed autoimmune hypophysitis occurs more commonly during and shortly after pregnancy than at any other time
Autoimmune pancreatitis may cause a variety of symptoms and signs which include pancreatic and biliary bile duct manifestations as well as systemic effects of the disease Two thirds of patients present with either painless jaundice due to bile duct obstruction or a mass in the head of the pancreas mimicking carcinoma As such a thorough evaluation to rule out cancer is important in cases of suspected AIP Type 1 AIP typically presents in a 60 70 year old male with painless jaundice In some cases imaging reveals a mass in the pancreas or diffuse pancreatic enlargement Narrowing in the pancreatic duct called strictures may occur Rarely Type 1 AIP presents with acute pancreatitis Type 1 AIP presents with manifestations of autoimmune disease IgG4 related in at least half of cases The most common form of systemic involvement is cholangitis which occurs in up to 80 percent of cases of Type 1 AIP Additional manifestations include inflammation in the salivary glands chronic sclerosing sialadenitis in the lungs resulting in scarring pulmonary fibrosis and nodules scarring within the chest cavity mediastinal fibrosis or in the anatomic space behind the abdomen retroperitoneal fibrosis and inflammation in the kidneys tubulointerstitial nephritis AIP is characterized by the following features
People with sleep apnea have problems with excessive daytime sleepiness EDS and impaired alertness OSA may increase risk for driving accidents and work related accidents If OSA is not treated people are at increased risk of other health problems such as diabetes Due to the disruption in daytime cognitive state behavioral effects may be present These can include moodiness belligerence as well as a decrease in attentiveness and energy These effects may become intractable leading to depression There is evidence that the risk of diabetes among those with moderate or severe sleep apnea is higher Finally because there are many factors that could lead to some of the effects previously listed some people are not aware that they have sleep apnea and are either misdiagnosed or ignore the symptoms altogether
There are a number of signs and symptoms characteristic of monosomy 1p36 but no one individual will display all of the possible features In general children will exhibit failure to thrive and global delays
The symptoms of Evans syndrome vary between patients depending on which blood cells are affected If red blood cells are attacked symptoms may include weakness and fatigue paleness or jaundice shortness of breath lightheadedness and or a fast heartbeat If platelets are attacked symptoms may include increased bruising prolonged nosebleeds increased bleeding from minor cuts and or Petechiae In the less common instance that white blood cells are attacked symptoms may include increased proneness to infection fevers and or mouth sores It has been variously reported that between 7 8 and 23 of patients who have autoimmune hemolytic anemia will also have thrombocytopenia and thus Evans syndrome The two cytopenias may occur together or sequentially
Classically weakness develops in the face then the shoulder girdle then the upper arm These muscles can be spared and other muscles usually are affected The order of muscle involvement can cause the appearance of weakness descending from the face to the legs Distribution and degree of muscle weakness is extremely variable even between identical twins Musculoskeletal pain is very common most often described in the neck shoulders lower back and the back of the knee Fatigue is also common Muscle weakness usually becomes noticeable on one side of the body before the other a hallmark of the disease The right shoulder and arm muscles are more often affected than the left upper extremity muscles independent of handedness 139 Otherwise neither side of the body has been found to be at more risk Classically symptoms appear in those 15 30 years of age although infantile onset adult onset and absence of symptoms despite having the causal genetics also occur FSHD1 with a very large D4Z4 deletion EcoRI 10 11 kb is more strongly associated with infantile onset and severe weakness On average FSHD2 presents 10 year later than FSHD1 Otherwise FSHD1 and FSHD2 are indistinguishable on the basis of weakness Disease progression is slow and long static phases in which no progression is apparent is not uncommon Less commonly individual muscles rapidly deteriorate over several months
Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency causes lactic acidosis and hyperammonaemia Lactic acidosis may then lead to liver failure hepatomegaly reduced ketone body synthesis and demyelination of neurons
In the absence of congenital heart defects individuals with situs inversus are homeostatically normal and can live standard healthy lives without any complications related to their medical condition There is a 5 10 prevalence of congenital heart disease in individuals with situs inversus totalis most commonly transposition of the great vessels The incidence of congenital heart disease is 95 in situs inversus with levocardia Many people with situs inversus totalis are unaware of their unusual anatomy until they seek medical attention for an unrelated condition such as a rib fracture or a bout of appendicitis The condition may also be discovered during the administration of certain medicines or during tests such as a barium meal or enema The reversal of the organs may then lead to some confusion as many signs and symptoms will be on the atypical side For example if an individual with situs inversus develops appendicitis they will present to the physician with lower left abdominal pain since that is where their appendix lies Thus in the event of a medical problem the knowledge that the individual has situs inversus can expedite diagnosis People with this rare condition should inform their doctors before an examination so the doctor can redirect their search for heart sounds and other signs Wearing a medical identification tag can help inform health care providers in the event the person is unable to communicate Situs inversus also complicates organ transplantation operations as donor organs will more likely come from situs solitus normal donors As hearts and livers are chiral geometric problems arise placing an organ into a cavity shaped in the mirror image For example a person with situs inversus who requires a heart transplant needs all their great vessels reattached to the donor heart However the orientation of these vessels in a person with situs inversus is reversed necessitating steps so that the blood vessels join properly
Odontogenic keratocysts can occur at any age however they are more common in the third to sixth decades The male to female ratio is approximately 2 1 The majority are found in the mandible with half occurring at the angle of the mandible
Arthritis means inflammation within the joint and is usually recognised by swelling pain stiffness and restricted joint movement Symptoms of JIA vary from individual to individual This is mainly because JIA is an umbrella term for several subtypes of JIA which differ according to the number of affected joints severity of disease and presence or absence of inflammation in other parts of the body The key clinical feature in JIA is persistent swelling of the affected joints Any joint can be affected but large joints such as the knee and ankle are most commonly involved Involvement of small joints of the hands and feet is more likely when many joints are affected polyarthritis Swollen joints may also feel warmer to touch Swelling may be difficult to detect clinically especially for joints such as those of the spine sacroiliac joints shoulder hip and jaw imaging techniques such as ultrasound or MRI can be very useful to identify the inflammation Joint pain is an important symptom although some children experience minimal or no pain with their arthritis In these children the first sign of arthritis may be limping especially in the morning Young children are often very good at changing how they move when they have joint pain they learn to move so that it does not hurt For example a child will not push up using an inflamed wrist when climbing instead putting their weight through the forearm Morning stiffness that improves later in the day is a common feature this implies inflammatory type joint pain versus mechanical type joint pain Swelling and pain usually result in limited movement of the affected joints for example a knee held bent causing a limp or being unable to make a full fist Limited movement may reduce a childs ability to fully participate in activities and undertake usual tasks such as those used for self care In some JIA subtypes more non specific symptoms of being unwell may be present such as lethargy fatigue and poor appetite Children with systemic JIA usually present with fever and a classic rash and may become quite ill Late effects of arthritis can include joint contractures stiff bent joints with loss of movement due to joint damage limb length discrepancies and muscle wasting Children with JIA vary in the degree to which they are affected by particular symptoms
The pineal gland produces the hormone melatonin which plays a role in regulating circadian rhythms A pinealoma may disrupt production of this hormone and insomnia may result Frequently paralysis of upward gaze along with several ocular findings such as convergence retraction nystagmus and eyelid retraction also known as Colliers sign and Light Near Dissociation pupil accommodates but doesnt react to light are known collectively as Parinauds syndrome or Dorsal Mid brain syndrome are the only physical symptoms seen This is caused by the compression of the vertical gaze center in the midbrain tectum at the level of the superior colliculus and cranial nerve III Work up usually includes Neuro imaging as seen on the right A pinealoma may cause interruption of hypothalamic inhibiting pathways sometimes leading to beta hCG secretion and consequent Leydigs cell stimulation endocrine syndrome Other symptoms may include hydrocephalus gait disturbances and precocious puberty
Individuals with Stickler syndrome experience a range of signs and symptoms Some people have no signs and symptoms others have some or all of the features described below In addition each feature of this syndrome may vary from subtle to severe A characteristic feature of Stickler syndrome is a somewhat flattened facial appearance This is caused by underdeveloped bones in the middle of the face including the cheekbones and the bridge of the nose A particular group of physical features called the Pierre Robin sequence is common in children with Stickler syndrome Robin sequence includes a U shaped or sometimes V shaped cleft palate an opening in the roof of the mouth with a tongue that is too large for the space formed by the small lower jaw Children with a cleft palate are also prone to ear infections and occasionally swallowing difficulties Many people with Stickler syndrome are very nearsighted described as having high myopia because of the shape of the eye People with eye involvement are prone to increased pressure within the eye ocular hypertension which could lead to glaucoma and tearing or detachment of the light sensitive retina of the eye retinal detachment Cataract may also present as an ocular complication associated with Sticklers Syndrome The jelly like substance within the eye the vitreous humour has a distinctive appearance in the types of Stickler syndrome associated with the COL2A1 and COL11A1 genes As a result regular appointments to a specialist ophthalmologist are advised The type of Stickler syndrome associated with the COL11A2 gene does not affect the eye People with this syndrome have problems that affect things other than the eyes and ears Arthritis abnormality to ends of long bones vertebrae abnormality curvature of the spine scoliosis joint pain and double jointedness are all problems that can occur in the bones and joints Physical characteristics of people with Stickler can include flat cheeks flat nasal bridge small upper jaw pronounced upper lip groove small lower jaw and palate abnormalities these tend to lessen with age and normal growth and palate abnormalities can be treated with routine surgery Another characteristic of this syndrome is a mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia which can cause reduced height Another sign of Stickler syndrome is mild to severe hearing loss that for some people may be progressive see hearing loss with craniofacial syndromes The joints of affected children and young adults may be very flexible hypermobile Arthritis often appears at an early age and worsens as a person gets older Learning difficulties not due to a deficit in intelligence can also occur because of hearing and sight impairments if the school is not informed and the student is not assisted within the learning environment Stickler syndrome is thought to be associated with an increased incidence of mitral valve prolapse of the heart although no definitive research supports this
Sneddons syndrome generally manifests with stroke or severe transient neurological symptoms and a skin rash livedo reticularis Livedo reticularis appears as a bluish purple netlike mottling of the skin Sneddons syndrome may instead present with livedo racemosa which involves larger less organized patches of bluish purple mottling of the skin Both are generally found first in the extremities both worsen in cold and either may occur without Sneddons Syndrome or any other systemic disease Sneddons Syndrome can be characterized by transient amnesia transient aphasia palsy headaches hypertension transient ischemic attacks TIA stroke coronary disease and dementia The skin manifestations may precede the neurologic symptoms by years
The onset is not dramatic When the boot or shoes are taken off there is a cramp like pain in the affected forefoot and moderate local edema appears on the dorsal aspect On moving each toe in turn that of the involved metatarsal causes pain and when the bone is palpated from the dorsal surface a point of tenderness is found directly over the lesion Radiography at this stage is negative but the condition is diagnosed correctly by military surgeons without the aid of x rays In civil life it is seldom diagnosed correctly for a week or two when because of lack of immobilization there is an excessive deposit of callus which may be palpable around the fracture
The disease is endemic in rural regions in South America and Central America Infection most commonly develops after minor scratches or insect bites but many patients cannot recall any skin trauma Human to human transmission does not occur and the disease is only acquired from the environment The disease manifests as chronic keloidal nodular lesions on the ears legs or arms
Cause Proctocolitis has many possible causes Common infectious causes of proctocolitis include Chlamydia trachomatis LGV Lymphogranuloma venereum Neisseria gonorrhoeae HSV and Helicobacter species It can also be idiopathic see colitis vascular as in ischemic colitis or autoimmune as in inflammatory bowel disease
List of common symptoms
Urocanic aciduria is thought to be relatively benign Although aggressive behavior and mental retardation have been reported with the disorder no definitive neurometabolic connection has yet been established
A primary CNS lymphoma usually presents with seizure headache cranial nerve findings altered mental status or other focal neurological deficits typical of a mass effect Systemic symptoms may include fever night sweats or weight loss Other symptoms include
The palate may appear gray or white and contain many papules or nodules that are slightly elevated with red dots in their center These red dots represent the ducts of minor salivary glands which have become inflamed by heat The condition is painless If a denture is normally worn while smoking then the mucosa underneath the denture appears unaffected by the condition In severe cases the mucosa may show fissuring and develop a dried lake bed appearance Other changes associated with tobacco use may be evident such as brown or black extrinsic staining of teeth from tar and other components of tobacco smoke
Muscle paresis or paralysis Fibrillations Fasciculations caused by increased receptor concentration on muscles to compensate for lack of innervation Hypotonia or atonia Tone is not velocity dependent Hyporeflexia Along with deep reflexes even cutaneous reflexes are also decreased or absent Strength weakness is limited to segmental or focal pattern Root innervated patternThe extensor plantar reflex is usually absent Muscle paresis paralysis hypotonia atonia and hyporeflexia areflexia are usually seen immediately following an insult Muscle wasting fasciculations and fibrillations are typically signs of end stage muscle denervation and are seen over a longer time period Another feature is the segmentation of symptoms only muscles innervated by the damaged nerves will be symptomatic
People with one copy of the gene for hemoglobin C termed heterozygous do not experience significant symptoms but can pass the abnormal gene onto their children this condition is called hemoglobin C trait When two hemoglobin C genes are present termed homozygous the individual is said to have hemoglobin C disease and may develop mild anemia as red blood cells containing hemoglobin C have a decreased lifespan The anemia in hemoglobin C disease is classified as hemolytic because it is caused by the destruction of red blood cells An enlarged spleen and sometimes jaundice may also occur Some persons with this disease may develop gallstones that require treatment Continued hemolysis may produce pigmented gallstones an unusual type of gallstone composed of the dark colored contents of red blood cells
Signs and symptoms of pseudobulbar palsy include
The features associated with this condition include mild to moderate learning difficulties short stature unique facial features small head and skeletal abnormalities including bony growths projecting from the surfaces of bones
Cleidocranial dysostosis is a general skeletal condition so named from the collarbone cleido and cranium deformities which people with it often have People with the condition usually present with a painless swelling in the area of the clavicles at 2 3 years of age Common features are
Locations can include the subcutaneous tissue on the scalp the pleura pleural effusion the pericardium pericardial effusion and the abdomen ascites Edema is usually seen in the fetal subcutaneous tissue sometimes leading to spontaneous abortion It is a prenatal form of heart failure in which the heart is unable to satisfy demand in most cases abnormally high for blood flow
Hair and bone abnormalities Hair abnormalities are very prominent in majority of the cases of TDO Kinky curly hair that is unusually dry and easily sheds is present at birth In 80 of cases the hair has a more relaxed appearance by adolescence The presence of this hair texture type is a defining characteristic between a diagnosis of TDO verses amelogenesis imperfecta with hypomaturation Additionally in TDO the nails are usually abnormally thin brittle and split frequently Cranial deficiencies are marked by the presence of having a long skull relative to its width or protrusive foreheads due to increased thickness of the cranial bones and premature closing of the associated sutures in the skull The long bones in the body arms legs are also abnormally long and tend to fracture very easily Osteosclerosis commonly seen in TDO cases is characterized by an increase in bone density affecting the skull and the mastoid process located behind the jawbone on the skull as well as a shortened ramus seen in people with TDO There are no known pathological problems associated with hair and bone changes in people with this disease Changes in the long bones tend to appear later in development but changes in the teeth appear once the teeth being to form called primary dentition The hair and bone abnormalities are evaluated radiographically during initial diagnosis and visually during the course of the disease Radiographic exams may be repeated if there is suspect of fracture
Abfraction lesions will generally occur in the region on the tooth where the greatest tensile stress is located In statements such as these there is no comment on whether the lesions occur above or below the CEJ One theory suggests that the abfraction lesions will only form above the CEJ However it is assumed that the abfraction lesions will occur anywhere in the cervical areas of affected teeth It is important to note that studies supporting this configuration of abfraction lesions also state that when there is more than one abnormally large tensile stress on a tooth two or more abfraction lesions can result on the one surface When looking at abfraction lesions there are generally three shapes in which they appear appearing as either wedge saucer or mixed patterns Wedge and saucer shaped lesions are the most common whereas mixed lesions are less frequently identified in the oral cavity In reference to figure 1 wedge shaped lesions have the sharpest internal line angles and saucer mixed shaped lesions are either smooth internally or a variety Clinically people with abfraction lesions can also present with tooth sensitivity in the associated areas This occurs because as the abfraction lesions appear dentine cementum is exposed The dentine and cementum are less dense than tooth enamel and therefore more susceptible to sensation from thermal mechanical sources
Patients diagnosed with porencephaly display a variety of symptoms from mild to severe effects on the patient Patients with severe cases of porencephaly have epileptic seizures and developmental delays whereas patients with a mild case of porencephaly display little to no seizures and typical neurodevelopment Infants with extensive defects show symptoms of the disorder shortly after birth and the diagnosis is usually made before the age of 1 The following text lists out common signs and symptoms of porencephaly in affected individuals along with a short description of certain terminologies
Some common physical symptoms may include weakness in extremities difficulties with coordination and balance spasticity paresthesia speech impediments tremors dizziness hearing loss vision impairments bowel and bladder difficulties
Sitosterolemia may share several clinical characteristics with the well characterized familial hypercholesterolemia FH such as the development of tendon xanthomas in the first 10 years of life and the development of premature atherosclerosis However in contrast to FH patients sitosterolemia patients usually have normal to moderately elevated total sterol levels and very high levels of plant sterols sitosterol campesterol stigmasterol avenosterol and 5α saturated stanols in their plasma Plasma sitosterol levels in sitosterolemia patients are 10 25 times higher than in normal individuals 8 60 mg dl Not all patients with sitosterolemia have tendon xanthomas thus absence of this should not be used to exclude this diagnosis Xanthomas may appear at any age even in childhood These may be present as subcutaneous xanthomas on the buttocks in children or in usual locations e g Achilles tendon extensor tendons of the hand in children and adults Xanthelasma and corneal arcus are less common Decreased range of motion with possible redness swelling and warmth of joints due to arthritis may be present In addition sitosterolemia patients may develop hemolytic episodes and splenomegaly Untreated the condition causes a significant increase in morbidity and mortality Coronary heart disease and its inherent health consequences are the primary causes of illness and premature death in untreated patients
Acutely early symptoms include a painful photophobic red watery eye This is due to active corneal inflammation resulting in vascular invasion and stromal necrosis which can be diffuse or localized This causes the pinkish discoloration of what was a clear transparent normal corneal tissue called Salmon patch of Hutchinson Such vascularization is likely to result in blurring of vision secondary to corneal stromal scarring the presence of ghost vessels and thinning of the cornea especially if it involves the visual axis
Considered to be neurologically based nonverbal learning disorder is characterized by
CAA is associated with brain hemorrhages particularly microhemorrhages Since CAA can be caused by the same amyloid protein that is associated with Alzheimers dementia brain bleeds are more common in people who have a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease However they can also occur in those who have no history of dementia The bleeding within the brain is usually confined to a particular lobe and this is slightly different compared to brain bleeds which occur as a consequence of high blood pressure hypertension a more common cause of a hemorrhagic stroke or bleeding in the brain
The mildest form of hepatic encephalopathy is difficult to detect clinically but may be demonstrated on neuropsychological testing It is experienced as forgetfulness mild confusion and irritability The first stage of hepatic encephalopathy is characterised by an inverted sleep wake pattern sleeping by day being awake at night The second stage is marked by lethargy and personality changes The third stage is marked by worsened confusion The fourth stage is marked by a progression to coma More severe forms of hepatic encephalopathy lead to a worsening level of consciousness from lethargy to somnolence and eventually coma In the intermediate stages a characteristic jerking movement of the limbs is observed asterixis liver flap due to its flapping character this disappears as the somnolence worsens There is disorientation and amnesia and uninhibited behaviour may occur In the third stage neurological examination may reveal clonus and positive Babinski sign Coma and seizures represent the most advanced stage cerebral edema swelling of the brain tissue leads to death Encephalopathy often occurs together with other symptoms and signs of liver failure These may include jaundice yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes ascites fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity and peripheral oedema swelling of the legs due to fluid build up in the skin The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated and the plantar reflex may be abnormal namely extending rather than flexing Babinskis sign in severe encephalopathy A particular smell on an affected persons breath foetor hepaticus may be detected
The condition may not be known to the affected individual and not result in any reproductive problems thus normal pregnancies occur Indeed there is no consensus on the relationship of the arcuate uterus and recurrent pregnancy loss Accordingly the condition may be a variation or a pathology One view maintains that the condition is associated with a higher risk for miscarriage premature birth and malpresentation Thus a study that evaluated women with uterine bleeding by hysteroscopy found that 6 5 of subjects displayed the arcuate uterus and had evidence of reproductive impairments A study based on hysterosalpingraphic detected arcuate lesions documented increased fetal loss and obstetrical complications as a risk for affected women Woelfer found that the miscarriage risk is more pronounced in the second trimester In contrast a study utilizing 3 D ultrasonography to document the prevalence of the arcuate uterus in a gynecological population found no evidence of increased risk of reproductive loss in this study 3 1 of women had an arcuate uterus making it the most common uterine anomaly this prevalence was similar than in women undergoing sterilization and lower than in women with recurrent pregnancy loss
Babies with severe aromatic L amino acid decarboxylase deficiency usually present during the first few months of life Symptoms can include
The following is a list of the symptoms most commonly exhibited Variable vertebral anomalies Brachydactyly Conductive hearing loss High palate Mitral regurgitation Mitral valve prolapse Short stature nearing dwarfism Short palms Carpal bone synostosisLess common symptoms include
Symptoms of Richter s transformation in a CLL patient include fever without infection elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase and rapidly enlarging lymph nodes While about 8 of all CLL patients will have elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase LDH more than 50 of CLL patients with Richters transformation will have elevated LDH levels Richters can appear suddenly even in patients who were in remission
Talon cusp will show physical signs of the irregular dental formation of the teeth and cause other symptoms of the disease that could possibly lead to dental problems in the future depending on severity of the deformity Most commonly the extra cusp is located on the lingual surface giving a three pronged appearance Rarely however the extra cusp may be situated on the facial surface or there may be extra cusps on both lingual and facial surfaces There may be a deep groove between the talon cusp and the rest of the tooth The extra cusp typically contains pulp tissue When viewing talon cusp from the occlusal the projection will appear x shaped as well as appears conical and mimic the shape of an eagles talon Symptoms of talon cusp include
Causes Acquired causes include atherosclerosis in adults Kawasaki disease in children and coronary catheterization With the invention of drug eluting stents there has been more cases implying stents lead to coronary aneurysms The pathophysiology although not completely understood might be comparable to that of aneurysms of larger vessels This includes disruption of the arterial media weakening of the arterial wall increased wall strain and slow dilatation of the coronary artery portion It can also be congenital The following risk factors are thought to be associated with coronary artery aneurysms
Clinically there is an acute onset of visual loss first in one eye and then a few weeks to months later in the other Onset is usually young adulthood but age range at onset from 7 75 is reported The age of onset is slightly higher in females range 19 55 years mean 31 3 years than males range 15 53 years mean 24 3 The male to female ratio varies between mutations 3 1 for 3460 G A 6 1 for 11778 G A and 8 1 for 14484 T C This typically evolves to very severe optic atrophy and a permanent decrease of visual acuity Both eyes become affected either simultaneously 25 of cases or sequentially 75 of cases with a median inter eye delay of 8 weeks Rarely only one eye is affected In the acute stage lasting a few weeks the affected eye demonstrates an oedematous appearance of the nerve fiber layer especially in the arcuate bundles and enlarged or telangiectatic and tortuous peripapillary vessels microangiopathy The main features are seen on fundus examination just before or after the onset of visual loss A pupillary defect may be visible in the acute stage as well Examination reveals decreased visual acuity loss of color vision and a cecocentral scotoma on visual field examination
Instantaneous hypotension due to sudden massive vasodilation and decrease in blood oxygen saturation Warm flushed skin due to vasodilation and inability to constrict blood vessels Priapism also due to vasodilation The patient will be unable to mount a tachycardic response and often becomes bradycardic If the injury is below cervical vertebrae C5 the patient will exhibit diaphragmatic breathing due to loss of nervous control of the intercostal muscles which are required for thoracic breathing If the injury is above C3 the patient will go into respiratory arrest immediately following the injury due to loss of nervous control of the diaphragm
Signs and symptoms include syndromic facies hearing loss facial paralysis
LCMV infection manifests itself in a wide range of clinical symptoms and may even be asymptomatic for immunocompetent individuals Onset typically occurs between one or two weeks after exposure to the virus and is followed by a biphasic febrile illness During the initial or prodromal phase which may last up to a week common symptoms include fever lack of appetite headache muscle aches malaise nausea and or vomiting Less frequent symptoms include a sore throat and cough as well as joint chest and parotid pain The onset of the second phase occurs several days after recovery and consists of symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis Pathological findings during the first stage consist of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia During the second phase typical findings include elevated protein levels increased leukocyte count or a decrease in glucose levels of the cerebrospinal fluid Occasionally a patient improves for a few days then relapses with aseptic meningitis or very rarely meningoencephalitis Patients with meningitis may have a stiff neck fever headache myalgia nausea and malaise In some occasions meningitis occurs without a prodromal syndrome Meningoencephalitis is characterized by more profound neurological signs such as confusion drowsiness sensory abnormalities and motor signs Under reported complications include myelitis Guillain Barré type syndrome cranial nerve palsies transient or permanent hydrocephalus sensorineural hearing loss orchitis arthritis and parotitis LCMV infections have also been associated with pancreatitis pneumonitis myocarditis and pericarditis The entire illness usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks nonetheless temporary or permanent neurological damage is possible in all central nervous system infections especially in cases of meningoencephalitis Chronic infections have not been reported in humans and deaths rarely occur
Abnormal mentation impaired judgment Nonspecific dysphoria anxiety moodiness depression crying fear of dying suicidal thoughts Negativism irritability belligerence combativeness rage Personality change emotional lability Fatigue weakness apathy lethargy daydreaming Confusion amnesia dizziness delirium Staring glassy look blurred vision double vision Automatic behavior Difficulty speaking slurred speech Ataxia incoordination sometimes mistaken for drunkenness Focal or general motor deficit paralysis hemiparesis Paresthesia headache Stupor coma abnormal breathing Generalized or focal seizures Plasma glucose 20 mg dL 1 1 mmol L or lowerNot all of the above manifestations occur in every case of hypoglycemia There is no consistent order to the appearance of the symptoms Specific manifestations vary by age and by the severity of the hypoglycemia In older children and adults moderately severe hypoglycemia can resemble mania mental illness drug intoxication or drunkenness In the elderly hypoglycemia can produce focal stroke like effects or a hard to define malaise The symptoms of a single person do tend to be similar from episode to episode In the large majority of cases hypoglycemia severe enough to cause seizures or unconsciousness can be reversed without obvious harm to the brain Cases of death or permanent neurological damage occurring with a single episode have usually involved prolonged untreated unconsciousness interference with breathing severe concurrent disease or some other type of vulnerability Nevertheless brain damage or death has occasionally resulted from severe hypoglycemia
Portal vein thrombosis causes upper abdominal pain possibly accompanied by nausea and an enlarged liver and or spleen the abdomen may be filled with fluid ascites A persistent fever may result from the generalized inflammation While abdominal pain may come and go if the thrombus forms suddenly long standing clot build up can also develop without causing symptoms leading to portal hypertension before it is diagnosed Other symptoms can develop based on the cause For example if portal vein thrombosis develops due to liver cirrhosis bleeding or other signs of liver disease may be present If portal vein thrombosis develops due to pylephlebitis signs of infection such as fever chills or night sweats may be present
While most cases of visual agnosia are seen in older adults who have experienced extensive brain damage there are also cases of young children with less brain damage during developmental years acquiring the symptoms Commonly visual agnosia presents as an inability to recognize an object in the absence of other explanations such as blindness or partial blindness anomia memory loss etc Other common manifestations of visual agnosia that are generally tested for include difficulty identifying objects that look similar in shape difficulty with identifying line drawings of objects and recognizing objects that are shown from less common views such as a horse from a top down view Within any given patient a variety of symptoms can occur and the impairment of ability is not only binary but can range in severity For example Patient SM is a prosopagnosic with a unilateral lesion to left extrastriate cortex due to an accident in his twenties who displays behavior similar to congenital prosopagnosia Although he can recognize facial features and emotions indeed he sometimes uses a standout feature to recognize a face face recognition is almost impossible purely from visual stimuli even for faces of friends family and himself The disorder also affects his memory of faces both in storing new memories of faces and recalling stored memories Nevertheless it is important to note the reach of symptoms to other domains SMs object recognition is similarly impaired though not entirely when given line drawings to identify he was able to give names of objects with properties similar to the drawing implying that he is able to see the features of the drawing Similarly copying a line drawing of a beach scene led to a simplified version of the drawing though the main features were accounted for For recognition of places he is still impaired but familiar places are remembered and new places can be stored into memory
STK typically occurs in the buccal sulcus inside the cheek or the labial sulcus between the lips and the teeth and corresponds to the site where the tobacco is held in the mouth It is painless The appearance of the lesion is variable depending upon the type of tobacco used and the frequency and duration of use It takes about 1 5 years of smokeless tobacco use for the lesion to appear Early lesions may appear as thin translucent and granular or wrinkled mucosa The later lesion may appear thicker more opaquely white and hyperkeratotic with fissures and folds Oral snuff causes more pronounced changes in the oral mucosa than tobacco chewing Snuff dipping is associated more with verrucous keratosis As well as the white changes of the oral mucosa there may be gingival recession receding gums and staining of tooth roots in the area where the tobacco is held
The majority of patients who are diagnosed with lung cancer usually present with locally advanced or metastatic disease Only about one third of patients have stage I disease when diagnosed The symptoms that the patient exhibits usually reflect the extent of the cancers spread Lung cancers that are discovered early may cause symptoms localized to the respiratory system However lung cancer that is advanced will cause patients to experience additional signs and symptoms secondary to the cancer spreading to other organ systems In order of highest frequency the most common signs of lung cancer include cough that does not go away or gets worse weight loss dyspnea shortness of breath or difficulty breathing chest pain which may be aggravated by deep breathing coughing or laughing hemoptysis coughing up blood or rust colored phlegm bone pain clubbing fever generally feeling tired or weak superior vena cava obstruction facial neck upper torso swelling This is caused by compression of vasculature by the lung tumor that restricts blood return from the upper body dysphagia trouble swallowing or the sensation that something is caught in the throat and hoarseness new onset of wheezing without history of asthmaClinicians should have a high level of suspicion for lung cancer especially in patients with a smoking history Patients with recurring or unresolving lung infections e g bronchitis and pneumonia that are unresponsive to antibiotics should also be further evaluated for lung cancer In nonsmokers women and East Asians are more likely to present with symptoms of an underlying lung cancer at younger ages Importantly many of these signs are commonly due to other causes that are not cancer A detailed medical history should be obtained from each patient to determine the relevance of further diagnostic workup and management
The most common presentation is gastrointestinal bleed 45 of cases followed by abdominal pain 43 of cases and anemia 15 of cases
Nicotine poisoning tends to produce symptoms that follow a biphasic pattern The initial symptoms are mainly due to stimulatory effects and include nausea and vomiting excessive salivation abdominal pain pallor sweating hypertension tachycardia ataxia tremor headache dizziness muscle fasciculations and seizures After the initial stimulatory phase a later period of depressor effects can occur and may include symptoms of hypotension and bradycardia central nervous system depression coma muscular weakness and or paralysis with difficulty breathing or respiratory failure From September 1 2010 to December 31 2014 there were at least 21 106 traditional cigarette calls to US poison control centers During the same period the ten most frequent adverse effects to traditional cigarettes reported to US poison control centers were vomiting 80 0 nausea 9 2 drowsiness 7 8 cough 7 2 agitation 6 6 pallor 3 0 tachycardia 2 5 diaphoresis 1 5 dizziness 1 5 and diarrhea 1 4 95 of traditional cigarette calls were related to children 5 years old or less Most of the traditional cigarette calls were a minor effect Calls to US poison control centers related to e cigarette exposures involved inhalations eye exposures skin exposures and ingestion in both adults and young children Minor moderate and serious adverse effects involved adults and young children Minor effects correlated with e cigarette liquid poisoning were tachycardia tremor chest pain and hypertension More serious effects were bradycardia hypotension nausea respiratory paralysis atrial fibrillation and dyspnea The exact correlation is not fully known between these effects and e cigarettes 58 of e cigarette calls to US poison control centers were related to children 5 years old or less E cigarette calls had a greater chance to report an adverse effect and a greater chance to report a moderate or major adverse effect than traditional cigarette calls Most of the e cigarette calls were a minor effect From September 1 2010 to December 31 2014 there were at least 5 970 e cigarette calls to US poison control centers During the same period the ten most frequent adverse effects to e cigarettes and e liquid reported to US poison control centers were vomiting 40 4 eye irritation or pain 20 3 nausea 16 8 red eye or conjunctivitis 10 5 dizziness 7 5 tachycardia 7 1 drowsiness 7 1 agitation 6 3 headache 4 8 and cough 4 5 E cigarette exposure cases in the US National Poison Data System increased greatly between 2010 and 2014 peaking at 3 742 in 2014 fell in 2015 though 2017 and then between 2017 and 2018 e cigarette exposure cases increased from 2 320 to 2 901 The majority of cases 65 were in children under age five and 15 were in ages 5 24 Approximately 0 1 of cases developed life threatening symptoms
Clinical signs and symptoms of complement mediated TMA can include abdominal pain confusion fatigue edema swelling nausea vomiting and diarrhea aHUS often presents with malaise and fatigue as well as microangiopathic anemia 1931 However severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea are unusual 1931 Laboratory tests may also reveal low levels of platelets cells in the blood that aid in clotting elevated lactate dehydrogenase LDH a chemical released from damaged cells and which is therefore a marker of cellular damage decreased haptoglobin indicative of the breakdown of red blood cells anemia low red blood cell count schistocytes damaged red blood cells elevated creatinine indicative of kidney dysfunction and proteinuria indicative of kidney injury Patients with aHUS often present with an abrupt onset of systemic signs and symptoms such as acute kidney failure hypertension high blood pressure myocardial infarction heart attack stroke lung complications pancreatitis inflammation of the pancreas liver necrosis death of liver cells or tissue encephalopathy brain dysfunction seizure or coma Failure of neurologic cardiac kidney and gastrointestinal GI organs as well as death can occur unpredictably at any time either very quickly or following prolonged symptomatic or asymptomatic disease progression For example approximately 1 in 6 patients with aHUS initially will present with proteinuria or hematuria without acute kidney failure Patients who survive the presenting signs and symptoms endure a chronic thrombotic and inflammatory state which puts many of them at lifelong elevated risk of sudden blood clotting kidney failure other severe complications and premature death
Rash which has a characteristic appearance spreading pattern and desquamating process e g Strawberry tongue
The average age of onset is the early to mid 30s Exertional dyspnea shortness of breath and spontaneous pneumothorax lung collapse have been reported as the initial presentation of the disease in 49 and 46 of patients respectively Diagnosis is typically delayed 5 to 6 years The condition is often misdiagnosed as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease The first pneumothorax or lung collapse precedes the diagnosis of LAM in 82 of patients The consensus clinical definition of LAM includes multiple symptoms Fatigue Cough Coughing up blood rarely massive Chest pain Chylous complications arising from lymphatic obstruction including Chylothorax Chylous ascites Chylopericardium Chyloptysis Chyluria Chyle in vaginal discharge Chyle in stool Angiomyolipomas fatty kidney tumors are present in about 30 of patients with sporadic LAM and up to 90 of patients with TSC LAM Angiomyolipomas can sometimes spontaneously bleed causing pain or low blood pressure Cystic lymphangiomas or lymph nodes with hypodense centers which mimic necrotizing lymphomas ovarian or renal cancers or other malignancies can occur in the retroperitoneum pelvis or mediastinum Lung destruction in LAM is a consequence of diffuse infiltration by neoplastic smooth muscle like cells that invade all lung structures including the lymphatics airway walls blood vessels and interstitial spaces The consequences of vessel and airway obstruction include chylous fluid accumulations hemoptysis airflow obstruction and pneumothorax The typical disease course displays progressive dyspnea on exertion spaced by recurrent pneumothoraces and in some patients chylous pleural effusions or ascites Most people have dyspnea on exertion with daily activities by 10 years after symptom onset Many patients require supplemental oxygen over that interval
In children symptoms may include
Symptoms Tearing pain located in the abdomen flank groin or back Loss of consciousness
Retrolisthesis may lead to symptoms of greatly varying intensity and distribution This is because of the variable nature of the impact on nerve tissue and of the mechanical impact on the spinal joints themselves Structural instability may be experienced as a local uneasiness through to a more far reaching structural compensatory distortion involving the whole spine If the joints are stuck in a retrolisthesis configuration there may also be changes to range of motion Pain may be experienced as a result of irritation to the sensory nerve roots by bone depending on the degree of displacement and the presence of any rotatory positioning of the individual spinal motion segments The soft tissue of the disc is often caused to bulge in retrolistheses These cannot be determined by plain films as the x ray passes through the soft tissue A study by Giles et al stated that sixteen of the thirty patients 53 had retrolisthesis of L5 on S1 ranging from 2 9 mm these patients had either intervertebral disc bulging or protrusion on CT examination ranging from 3 7 mm into the spinal canal Fourteen patients 47 without retrolisthesis control group did not show any retrolisthesis and the CT did not show any bulge protrusion On categorizing x ray and CT pathology as being present or not the well positioned i e true lateral plain x ray film revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 100 95 Confidence Interval 89 100 for bulge protrusion in this preliminary study 7 Spinal cord compressions are also possible with patients experiencing pain rigidity and neurologic signs that may follow some distance along nerves to cause symptoms at some distance from the location of the retrolisthesis
Signs and symptoms of pseudomyxoma peritonei may include abdominal or pelvic pain and or bloating distension digestive disorders weight changes increased girth and infertility
When symptoms occur they can include acute attacks similar to acute intermittent porphyria or skin damage Acute attacks usually begin in adulthood and cause abdominal pain vomiting diarrhoea and constipation During an attack a person may also experience muscle weakness seizures and mental changes such as anxiety and hallucinations These signs and symptoms are triggered by nongenetic factors such as certain drugs dieting or fasting certain hormones and stress Some people with variegate porphyria have skin that is overly sensitive to sunlight photosensitive Areas of skin exposed to the sun develop severe blistering scarring changes in pigmentation and increased hair growth Exposed skin becomes fragile and is easily damaged Rarely the signs and symptoms of variegate porphyria can begin in infancy or early childhood In such cases the signs and symptoms are usually more severe than those starting later in life
Patients with Mauriac syndrome may present with obesity hepatomegaly cushingoid facies and elevated liver enzymes Patients usually have growth failure and delayed puberty which should warn the physician about insufficient management of the patients diabetes These symptoms can be reversed with good glycemic control
The symptoms to dysgraphia are often overlooked or attributed to the student being lazy unmotivated careless or anxious The condition may also be dismissed as simply being an expression of attention deficiency or having delayed visual motor processing In order to be diagnosed with dysgraphia one must have a cluster but not necessarily all of the following symptoms
Extraesophageal symptoms result from exposure of the upper aerodigestive tract to gastric contents This causes a variety of symptoms including hoarseness postnasal drip sore throat difficulty swallowing indigestion wheezing globus pharyngeus and chronic throat clearing Some people with LPR have heartburn while others have little to no heartburn as refluxed stomach contents do not remain in the esophagus long enough to irritate the surrounding tissue Individuals with more severe forms of LPR may experience abrasion of tooth enamel due to intermittent presence of gastric contents in the oral cavity Additionally LPR can cause inflammation in the vocal tract which results in the symptom of dysphonia or hoarseness Hoarseness is considered to be one of the primary symptoms of LPR and is associated with complaints such as strain vocal fatigue musculoskeletal tension and hard glottal attacks all of which can reduce a persons ability to communicate effectively Moreover LPR patients may try to compensate for their hoarseness by increasing muscular tension in their vocal tract This hyper functional technique adopted in response to the inflammation caused by LPR can lead to a condition called muscle tension dysphonia and may persist even after the hoarseness and inflammation has disappeared A speech language pathologist will often need to be involved to help resolve this maladaptive compensatory pattern through the implementation of voice therapy LPR presents as a chronic and intermittent disease in children LPR in children and infants tends to manifest with a unique set of symptoms Symptoms seen in children with LPR include a cough hoarseness stridor sore throat asthma vomiting globus sensation wheezing aspiration and recurrent pneumonia Common symptoms of LPR in infants include wheezing stridor persistent or recurrent cough apnea feeding difficulties aspiration regurgitation and failure to thrive Moreover LPR in children is commonly concomitant with laryngeal disorders such as laryngomalacia subglottic stenosis and laryngeal papillomatosis
People with Aarskog Scott syndrome often have distinctive facial features such as widely spaced eyes hypertelorism a small nose a long area between the nose and mouth philtrum and a widows peak hairline They frequently have mild to moderate short stature during childhood but their growth usually catches up with that of their peers during puberty Hand abnormalities are common in this syndrome and include short fingers brachydactyly curved pinky fingers fifth finger clinodactyly webbing of the skin between some fingers cutaneous syndactyly and a single crease across the palm Other abnormalities in people with Aarskog Scott syndrome include heart defects and a split in the upper lip cleft lip with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth cleft palate Most males with Aarskog Scott syndrome have a shawl scrotum in which the scrotum surrounds the penis instead of hanging below Less often they have undescended testes cryptorchidism or a soft out pouching around the belly button umbilical hernia or in the lower abdomen inguinal hernia The intellectual development of people with Aarskog Scott syndrome varies widely Some may have mild learning and behavior problems while others have normal intelligence In rare cases severe intellectual disability has been reported
Individuals affected by RS3PE typically have repeated episodes of inflammation of the lining of their synovial joints and swelling of the end portion of the limbs The arms and hands are more commonly affected than the legs and feet Both sides are usually involved though RS3PE can affect only one side in certain cases
Because uveitic glaucoma is a progressive stage of anterior non infectious uveitis uveitic glaucoma involves signs and symptoms of both glaucoma and uveitis Patients with acute non infectious anterior uveitis may experience the following symptoms pain blurry vision headache photophobia discomfort or pain due to light exposure or the observance of haloes around lights An ophthalmologist may be able to observe the main sign of active noninfectious anterior uveitis which is the presence of immune cells anterior chamber cells or ACCs floating within the anterior segment of the eye see Noninfectious anterior uveitis in Diagnosis section The ophthalmologist also may observe peripheral anterior synechiae PAS or adhesions between the iris and trabecular meshwork the tissue responsible for draining aqueous humour from the eye Patients with uveitis who also experience symptoms of glaucoma may have uveitic glaucoma In an eye with uveitic glaucoma the following glaucoma signs may be observed elevated intraocular pressure scotomas in the field of vision defects in the fiber layer of the retinal nerve and or excavation a regional deformation or depression of the optic nerve Pupillary blocks or the obstruction of the flow of aqueous humor from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber due to a functional block between the pupillary portion of the iris and the lens may also be detected Finally the ophthalmologist may observe peripheral anterior synechiae PAS or adhesions between the iris and trabecular meshwork The dual presence of glaucoma and uveitis symptoms points to a diagnosis of uveitic glaucoma
Individuals with GEFS present with a range of epilepsy phenotypes These include febrile seizures that end by age 6 FS such seizures extending beyond age 6 that may include afebrile tonic clonic myoclonic absence atonic seizures and myoclonic astatic epilepsy Individuals may also present with SMEI characterized by generally tonic clonic seizures impaired psychomotor development myoclonic seizures ataxia and poor response to many anticonvulsants

The symptoms associated with the disorder are often confused for other dermatological disorders The symptoms below are ones specifically associated with IPS
These include red skin rash usually of the face elbows and knees skin desquamation exanthema red tongue toxic shock syndromeOther features include mesenteric lymphadenitis and arthritis Kidney failure rarely occurs Relapses occur in up to 50 of patients
Pathophysiology Rokitansky Aschoff sinuses Rokitansky Aschoff sinuses are pseudodiverticula or pockets in the wall of the gallbladder They may be microscopic or macroscopic Histologically they are outpouchings of gallbladder mucosa into the gallbladder muscle layer and subserosal tissue as a result of hyperplasia and herniation of epithelial cells through the fibromuscular layer of the gallbladder wall Rokitansky Aschoff sinuses are not of themselves considered abnormal but they can be associated with cholecystitis They form as a result of increased pressure in the gallbladder and recurrent damage to the wall of the gallbladder
Signs and symptoms of CBPS typically appear in infancy or at birth but can appear later in childhood These include facial diplegia paralysis on both sides facial muscle spasms pseudobulbar palsy dysarthria difficulty speaking difficulty chewing dysphagia difficulty swallowing epilepsy and intellectual disability Epileptic seizures in individuals with CBPS are different between individuals and can vary between episodes
The onset of ocular symptoms are usually preceded by episode of viral or flu like symptoms such as fever cough or sore throat however this is not always the case Patients can typically present erythema nodosum livido reticularus bilateral uveitis and sudden onset of marked visual loss associated with the appearance of multiple lesions in the retina These lesions may be colored from grey white to cream shaded yellow Other symptoms include scotomata and photopsia In weeks to a month times the lesions begin to clear and disappear with prednisone leaving behind areas of retinal pigment epithelial atrophy and diffuse fine pigmentation scarring Rarely choroidal neovascularization occur as a late onset complication
The usual symptoms are Abdominal pain Bleeding under skin due to blood clotting problems Bleeding from mouth nose or rectum Gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea vomiting which can be with blood and diarrhea Fever Chills Low blood pressure Organ failure Shock Death of tissue gangrene in extremities mostly fingers nose and toes Difficulty breathingThese symptoms are common to many human illnesses and are not considered in and of themselves to signify infection with any form of plague It is important to note that septicemic plague may be asymptomatic and may cause death absent of any symptoms
Faintness dizziness headache increased pulse restlessness nausea vomiting pale clammy skin and brief loss of consciousness
The following list comprises the most common symptoms people with this disorder exhibit Severe micrognathia Thorax in the shape of a bell Cleft palate Neonatal respiratory difficulties Rib gapsCommon but not the most symptoms include
Four stages are recognised in this condition The first latent stage show no symptoms or signs This stage typically lasts up to the early 20s This is followed by the osseous stage This is characterised by recurrent bone pain usually affecting the long bones of the limbs This is usually followed by pathological fractures of these bones The third stage early neurological is marked by the onset of symptoms typical of a frontal lobe syndrome euphoria lack of concentration loss of judgment and social inhibitions with memory loss Epilepsy may occur This stage usually has its onset in the late 20s and early 30s The final stage is characterised by severe dementia and paralysis Death usually occurs in the late 40s or early 50s
right ventricular heave Loud S1 fixed split S2 S3 gallop systolic ejection murmur at left upper sternal border cardiomegaly right axis deviation on ECG Snowman sign or figure of 8 configuration on chest radiograph right ventricular hypertrophy cyanosis tachypnea dyspnea since the overloaded pulmonary circuit can cause pulmonary edema Cottage loaf sign that is chest X ray appearance similar to a cottage loaf also known as the snow man sign or figure of 8 sign
Nutcracker esophagus is characterized as a motility disorder of the esophagus meaning that it is caused by abnormal movement or peristalsis of the esophagus People with motility disorders present with two main symptoms chest pain or difficulty with swallowing Chest pain is the more common The chest pain is very severe and intense and mimics cardiac chest pain It may spread into the arm and back The symptoms of nutcracker esophagus are intermittent and may occur with or without food Rarely patients can present with a sudden obstruction of the esophagus after eating food termed a food bolus obstruction or the steakhouse syndrome requiring urgent treatment The disorder does not progress to produce worsening symptoms or complications unlike other motility disorders such as achalasia or anatomical abnormalities of the esophagus such as peptic strictures or esophageal cancer Many patients with nutcracker esophagus do not have any symptoms at all as esophageal manometry studies done on patients without symptoms may show the same motility findings as nutcracker esophagus Nutcracker esophagus may also be associated with metabolic syndrome The incidence of nutcracker esophagus in all patients is uncertain
The most common signs leading to the diagnosis of Noonan syndrome are unique facial characteristics and musculoskeletal features The facial characteristics are most prominent in infancy becoming less apparent with age in many people with Noonan syndrome
In contrast to those with angina secondary to atherosclerosis people with variant angina are generally younger and have fewer risk factors for coronary artery disease with the exception of smoking which is a common and significant risk factor for both types of angina Affected people usually have repeated episodes of unexplained e g in the absence of exertion and occurring at sleep or in the early morning hours chest pain tightness in throat chest pressure light headedness excessive sweating and or reduced exercise tolerance that unlike atherosclerosis related angina typically does not progress to myocardial infarction heart attack Unlike cases of atherosclerosis related stable angina these symptoms are often unrelated to exertion and occur in night or early morning hours However individuals with atherosclerosis related unstable angina may similarly exhibit night to early morning hour symptoms that are unrelated to exertion Cardiac examination of individuals with variant angina is usually normal in the absence of current symptoms Two thirds of these individuals do have concurrent atherosclerosis of a major coronary artery but this is often mild or not in proportion to the degree of their symptoms Persons who have atherosclerosis based occlusion that is 70 in a single coronary artery or that involves multiple coronary arteries are predisposed to develop a variant angina form that has a poorer prognosis than most other forms of this disorder In these individuals but also in a small percentage of individuals without appreciable atherosclerosis of their coronary arteries attacks of coronary artery spasm can have far more serious presentations such as fainting shock and cardiac arrest Typically these presentations reflect the development of a heart attack and or a potentially lethal heart arrhythmia they require immediate medical intervention as well as consideration for the presence of and specific treatment regimens for their disorder Variant angina should be suspected by a cardiologist when a an individuals symptoms occur at rest or during sleep b an individuals symptoms occur in clusters c an individual with a history of angina does not develop angina during treadmill stress testing variant angina is exercise tolerant d an individual with a history of angina shows no evidence of other forms of cardiac disease and or e an individual without features of coronary artery atherosclerotic heart disease has a history of unexplained fainting Complaints of chest pain should be immediately checked for an abnormal electrocardiogram ECG ECG changes compatible but not indicative of variant angina include elevations rather than depressions of the ST segment or an elevated ST segment plus a widening of the R wave to create a single broad QRS complex peak termed the monophasic curve Associated with these ECG changes there may be small elevations in the blood levels of cardiac damage marker enzymes especially during long attacks Some individuals with otherwise typical variant angina may show depressions rather than elevations in the ST segments of their ECGs during angina pain they may also show new U waves on ECGs during angina attacks A significant percentage of those with variant angina have symptom free episodes of coronary artery spasm These episodes may be far more frequent than expected cause myocardial ischemia i e insufficient blood flow to portions of the heart and be accompanied by potentially serious abnormalities in the rhythm of heart beats i e arrythmias The only evidence of the presence of totally asymptomatic variant angina would be detection of diagnostic changes on fortuitously conducted ECGs
This condition causes severe infections it is characterized by elevated immunoglobulins that function poorly Other symptoms are Bronchiectasis Hepatosplenomegaly Pyoderma Emphysema Diarrhea
Physical symptoms may include Muscle weakness Degeneration of muscle tissue Fatigue Heat intolerance
Symptoms may include abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding during pregnancy As this is nonspecific in areas where ultrasound is not available the diagnosis was often only discovered during surgery to investigate the abnormal symptoms They are typically diagnosed later in the developing world than the developed In about half of cases from a center in the developing world the diagnosis was initially missed It is a dangerous condition as there can be bleeding into the abdomen that results in low blood pressure and can be fatal Other causes of death in women with an abdominal pregnancy include anemia pulmonary embolus coagulopathy and infection
Some specific symptoms vary from one type of leukodystrophy to the next but the vast majority of symptoms are shared as the causes for the disease generally have the same effects Symptoms are dependent on the age of onset which is predominantly in infancy and early childhood although the exact time of onset may be difficult to determine Hyperirritability and hypersensitivity to the environment are common as well as some tell tale physical signs including muscle rigidity and a backwards bent head Botox therapy is often used to treat patients with spasticity Juvenile and adult onsets display similar symptoms including a decrease or loss in hearing and vision While children do experience optic and auditory degeneration the course of the disease is usually too rapid causing death relatively quickly whereas adults may live with these conditions for many years In children spastic activity often precedes progressive ataxia and rapid cognitive deterioration which has been described as mental retardation Epilepsy is commonplace for patients of all ages More progressed patients show weakness in deglutition leading to spastic coughing fits due to inhaled saliva Classic symptomatic progression of juvenile X linked adrenoleukodystrophy is shown in the 1992 film Lorenzos Oil Course and timetable are dependent on the age of onset with infants showing a lifespan of 2 8 years juveniles 2 10 years and adults typically 10 years Adults typically see an extended period of stability followed by a decline to a vegetative state and death While treatments do exist most are in the experimental phase and can only promise a halt in the progression of symptoms although some gene therapies have shown some symptomatic improvement The debilitating course of the disease has led to numerous philosophical and ethical arguments over experimental clinical trials patients rights and physician assisted suicide
Most types of RPGN are characterized by severe and rapid loss of kidney function with marked hematuria red blood cell casts in the urine and proteinuria sometimes exceeding three grams in twenty four hours a range associated with nephrotic syndrome Some patients also experience hypertension and edema Severe disease is characterized by pronounced oliguria or anuria which portends a poor prognosis
In adults the primary manifestation is an increase in heart rate of more than 30 beats per minute within ten minutes of standing up The resulting heart rate is typically more than 120 beats per minute For people between ages 12 and 19 the minimum increase for a POTS diagnosis is 40 beats per minute POTS is often accompanied by common features of orthostatic intolerance in which symptoms that develop while upright are relieved by reclining These orthostatic symptoms include palpitations light headedness chest discomfort shortness of breath nausea weakness or heaviness in the lower legs blurred vision and cognitive difficulties Symptoms may be exacerbated with prolonged sitting prolonged standing alcohol heat exercise or eating a large meal Up to one third of POTS patients experience fainting for many reasons including but not limited to standing physical exertion or heat exposure POTS patients may also experience orthostatic headaches Some POTS patients may develop blood pooling in the extremities characterized by a reddish purple color of the legs and or hands upon standing 48 of people with POTS report chronic fatigue and 32 report sleep disturbances Other POTS patients only exhibit the cardinal symptom of orthostatic tachycardia Additional signs and symptoms are varied and may include excessive sweating lack of sweating heat intolerance digestive issues such as nausea indigestion constipation and diarrhea post exertional malaise coat hanger pain brain fog and syncope or presyncope
The initial acute phase of EMS which last for three to six months presents as trouble with breathing and muscle problems including soreness and spasm but which may also be intense Muscle weakness is not a feature of this phase but some people experience muscle stiffness Additional features can include cough fever fatigue joint pain edema and numbness or tingling usually in the limbs hands and feet The chronic phase follows the acute phase Eosinophilic fasciitis may develop primarily in the limbs CNS signs may appear including numbness increased sensation muscle weakness and sometimes cardiac or digestive dysfunction Fatigue is present to some degree while the muscle pain which may be extremely intense and dyspnea continue in this phase
Orbital cellulitis commonly presents with painful eye movement sudden vision loss chemosis bulging of the infected eye and limited eye movement Along with these symptoms patients typically have redness and swelling of the eyelid pain discharge inability to open the eye occasional fever and lethargy
ADHD is a chronic condition beginning in early childhood that can persist throughout a persons lifetime It is estimated that 33 66 of children with ADHD will continue to have significant ADHD related symptoms persisting into adulthood resulting in a significant impact on education employment and interpersonal relationships Individuals with ADHD exhibit deficiencies in self regulation and self motivation which in turn foster problematic characteristics such as distractibility procrastination and disorganization They are often perceived by others as chaotic with a tendency to need high stimulation to be less distracted and function effectively The learning potential and overall intelligence of an adult with ADHD however is no different from the potential and intelligence of adults who do not have the disorder Whereas teachers and caregivers responsible for children are often attuned to the symptoms of ADHD employers and others who interact with adults are less likely to regard such behaviors as a symptom In part this is because symptoms do change with maturity adults who have ADHD are less likely to exhibit obvious hyperactive behaviors Instead they may report constant mental activity and inner restlessness as their hyperactivity internalizes Symptoms of ADHD see table below can vary widely between individuals and throughout the lifetime of an individual As the neurobiology of ADHD is becoming increasingly understood it is becoming evident that difficulties exhibited by individuals with ADHD are due to problems with the parts of the brain responsible for executive functions see below Pathophysiology These result in problems with sustaining attention planning organization prioritization time management impulse control and decision making The difficulties generated by these deficiencies can range from moderate to extreme resulting in the inability to effectively structure their lives plan daily tasks or think of and act accordingly even when aware of potential consequences These can lead to poor performance in school and work and can be followed by underachievement in these areas In young adults poor driving records with traffic violations may surface As problems accumulate a negativistic self view becomes established and a vicious circle of failure is set up Up to 80 of adults may have some form of psychiatric comorbidity such as depression or anxiety Many with ADHD also have associated learning disabilities such as dyslexia which contributes to their difficulties Studies on adults with ADHD have shown that more often than not they experience self stigma and depression in childhood commonly resulting from feeling neglected and different from their peers These problems may play a role in the high levels of depression substance abuse and relationship problems that affect adults with ADHD later in life
Although symptoms include an enlargement in the size of the spleen or a change from the spleens original position to another location usually in either other parts of the abdomen or into the pelvis This ability to move to other locations is commonly attributed to the spleens pedicle being abnormally long Physical factors may cause ischuria constipation as well as numerous spleen related diseases such as hypersplenism thrombocytopenia and lymphoma Blocking of the arteries and torsion twisting that interrupts the blood supply to that organ in the spleen can also result in abdominal pain or swelling However lack of visible symptoms except in incidents of abdominal pain makes the disease difficult for doctors to diagnose though medical imaging techniques such as medical ultrasonography magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography can be used to confirm its occurrence Characteristics of the disorder include the loss weakening or malformation of the ligaments that help to keep the spleen located in the upper left part of the abdomen
Symptoms of this disease typically begin within 2 weeks of contact with the causative organism Signs Symptoms may include Fever Chills Headache Confusion Cough Rapid Breathing Body Muscle Aches Rash Nausea VomitingAfter 5 6 days a macular skin eruption develops first on the upper trunk and spreading to the rest of the body rarely to the face palms or soles of the feet however Brill Zinsser disease first described by Nathan Brill in 1913 at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City is a mild form of epidemic typhus that recurs in someone after a long period of latency similar to the relationship between chickenpox and shingles This recurrence often arises in times of relative immunosuppression which is often in the context of a person suffering malnutrition or other illnesses In combination with poor sanitation and hygiene in times of social chaos and upheaval which enable a greater density of lice this reactivation is why typhus generates epidemics in such conditions
Patients with CED complain of chronic bone pain in the legs or arms muscle weakness myopathy and experience a waddling gait Other clinical problems associated with the disease include increased fatigue weakness muscle spasms headache difficulty gaining weight and delay in puberty Some patients have an abnormal or absent tibia may present with a flat foot or scoliosis This disease may also cause bones to become abnormally hardened which is referred to as sclerosis This hardening may affect the bones at the base of the skull or those in the hands feet or jaw This causes ongoing pain and aching within the body parts that are affected The pain has been described as either a hot electric stabbing pain an ever increasing pressure sensation around the bones especially before electrical storms or as a constant ache that radiates through several long bones at once Pain may also occur in the hips wrists knees and other joints as they essentially just lock up often becoming very stiff immobile and sore mostly when walking up or down staircases writing for extended periods of time or during the colder months of the year Those with the disease tend to have a very characteristic walk medically diagnosed as a waddling gait This is observed by the broad based gait with a duck like waddle to the swing phase the pelvis drops to the side of the leg being raised notable forward curvature of the lumbar spine and a marked body swing The pain is especially severe during a flare up these can be unpredictable exhausting and last anywhere from a few hours to several weeks This is a common occurrence for several CED patients often causing myopathy and extensive sleep deprivation from the chronic severe and disabling pain Patients may even require the use of a wheelchair or additional carers help with getting dressed showering mobility shopping preparing meals or lifting heavy items especially when bedridden or housebound for days or weeks at a time Flare ups may be attributed to or exacerbated by growth spurts stress exhaustion exercise standing or walking for too long illness infection being accidentally knocked hurt or injured after surgery anaesthetics cold weather electrical storms and sudden changes in barometric pressure CED may also affect internal organs the liver and spleen which may become enlarged A loss of vision and or hearing can occur if bones are adversely affected by the hardening in the skull Hence proactive specialist check ups X rays diagnostic tests scans and regular blood tests are recommended on an annual basis to monitor the CED bony growth and secondary medical issues that may arise from this condition
Superior alternating hemiplegia Superior alternating hemiplegia also known as Weber syndrome has a few distinct symptoms contralateral hemiparesis of limb and facial muscle accompanied by weakness in one or more muscles that control eye movement on the same side Another symptom that appears is the loss of eye movement due to damage to the oculomotor nerve fibers The upper and lower extremities have increased weakness
Humans When mastocytomas affect humans they are typically found in skin They usually occur as a single lesion on the trunk or wrist Although it is rare mastocytomas are sometimes found in the lung It can also affect children
Symptoms include weakness and numbness of the limbs deficits in sensation and motor skills dysfunctional urethral and anal sphincter activities and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system that can lead to episodes of high blood pressure Symptoms typically develop over the course of hours to a few weeks Sensory symptoms of TM may include a sensation of pins and needles traveling up from the feet The degree and type of sensory loss will depend upon the extent of the involvement of the various sensory tracts but there is often a sensory level at the spinal ganglion of the segmental spinal nerve below which sensation to pain or light touch is impaired Motor weakness occurs due to involvement of the pyramidal tracts and mainly affects the muscles that flex the legs and extend the arms Disturbances in sensory nerves and motor nerves and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system at the level of the lesion or below are noted Therefore the signs and symptoms depend on the area of the spine involved Back pain can occur at the level of any inflamed segment of the spinal cord If the upper cervical segment of the spinal cord is involved all four limbs may be affected and there is risk of respiratory failure the phrenic nerve which is formed by the cervical spinal nerves C3 C4 and C5 innervates the main muscle of respiration the diaphragm Lesions of the lower cervical region C5 T1 will cause a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the upper limbs and exclusively upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs Cervical lesions account for about 20 of cases A lesion of the thoracic segment T1 12 will produce upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs presenting as a spastic paraparesis This is the most common location of the lesion and therefore most individuals will have weakness of the lower limbs A lesion of the lumbar segment the lower part of the spinal cord L1 S5 often produces a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the lower limbs Lumbar lesions account for about 10 of cases
When a diagnosis of multicystic kidney is made in utero by ultrasound the disease is found to be bilateral in many cases Those with bilateral disease often have other severe deformities or polysystemic malformation syndromes In bilateral cases the newborn has the classic characteristic of Potters syndrome The bilateral condition is incompatible with survival as the contralateral system frequently is abnormal as well Contralateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction is found in 3 to 12 of infants with multicystic kidney and contralateral vesicoureteral reflux is seen even more often in 18 to 43 of infants Because the high incidence of reflux voiding cystourethrography usually has been considered advisable in all newborns with a multicystic kidney
A ranula usually presents as a translucent blue dome shaped fluctuant swelling in the tissues of the floor of the mouth If the lesion is deeper then there is a greater thickness of tissue separating from the oral cavity and the blue translucent appearance may not be a feature A ranula can develop into a large lesion many centimeters in diameter with resultant elevation of the tongue and possibly interfering with swallowing dysphagia The swelling is not fixed may not show blanching and is non painful unless it becomes secondarily infected The usual location is lateral to the midline which may be used to help distinguish it from a midline dermoid cyst A cervical ranula presents as a swelling in the neck with or without a swelling in the mouth In common with other mucoceles ranulae may rupture and then cause recurrent swelling Ranulae may be asymptomatic although they can fluctuate rapidly in size shrinking and swelling making them difficult to detect
List of common symptoms Depressed nasal bridge Median cleft lip Central nervous system lipomas Nasal polyposis Presence of skin tags Subcutaneous noduleList of not so common symptoms 2
Hyperinsulinism due to reduced insulin sensitivity is usually asymptomatic In contrast hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia can produce any of the entire range of hypoglycemic symptoms from shakiness and weakness to seizures or coma
Individuals with Jefferson fractures usually experience pain in the upper neck but no neurological signs The fracture may also cause damage to the arteries in the neck resulting in lateral medullary syndrome Horners syndrome ataxia and the inability to sense pain or temperature In rare cases congenital abnormality may cause the same symptoms as a Jefferson fracture
Jaundice Diarrhea Vomiting Fever Confusion Slurred speech Difficulty swallowing Change in gait staggering frequent falling Seizures
Patients with arachnoid cysts may never show symptoms even in some cases where the cyst is large Therefore while the presence of symptoms may provoke further clinical investigation symptoms independent of further data cannot and should not be interpreted as evidence of a cysts existence size location or potential functional impact on the patient Symptoms vary by the size and location of the cyst s though small cysts usually have no symptoms and are discovered only incidentally On the other hand a number of symptoms may result from large cysts
Signs and symptoms usually include a fever greater than 38 0 C 100 4 F chills low abdominal pain and possibly bad smelling vaginal discharge It usually occurs after the first 24 hours and within the first ten days following delivery
Akinetopsia can be separated into two categories inconspicuous akinetopsia or gross akinetopsia based on symptom severity and the amount the akinetopsia affects the patients quality of life
Rashes including red patchy ones near the mouth erythematous periorofacial macular rash Fine and brittle hair
People with ODD syndrome often have a characteristic appearance Visible features of the condition include small teeth that are prone to dental caries because of underdeveloped tooth enamel a long thin nose unusually small eyes and type III syndactyly of the fourth and fifth fingers Iris atrophy and glaucoma are more common than average The size of the eyes often interferes with learning to read special eyeglasses may be required Hair may be fine thin dry or fragile in some families it is curly Neurologic abnormalities may be seen in adults The neurologic changes may appear earlier in each subsequent generation and can include abnormal white matter conductive deafness and various kinds of paresis including ataxia spastic paraplegia difficulty controlling the eyes and bladder and bowel disturbances
The disease is classically a five day fever of the relapsing type rarely exhibiting a continuous course The incubation period is relatively long at about two weeks The onset of symptoms is usually sudden with high fever severe headache pain on moving the eyeballs soreness of the muscles of the legs and back and frequently hyperaesthesia of the shins The initial fever is usually followed in a few days by a single short rise but there may be many relapses between periods without fever The most constant symptom is pain in the legs Recovery takes a month or more Lethal cases are rare but in a few cases the persistent fever might lead to heart failure Aftereffects may include neurasthenia cardiac disturbances and myalgia
Symptoms of ileus include but are not limited to moderate to severe diffuse abdominal pain constipation abdominal distension nausea vomiting especially after meals vomiting of bilious fluid lack of bowel movement and or flatulence excessive belching
Vaginal bleeding or spotting in women after menopause occurs in 90 of endometrial cancer Bleeding is especially common with adenocarcinoma occurring in two thirds of all cases Abnormal menstrual cycles or extremely long heavy or frequent episodes of bleeding in women before menopause may also be a sign of endometrial cancer Symptoms other than bleeding are not common Other symptoms include thin white or clear vaginal discharge in postmenopausal women More advanced disease shows more obvious symptoms or signs that can be detected on a physical examination The uterus may become enlarged or the cancer may spread causing lower abdominal pain or pelvic cramping Painful sexual intercourse or painful or difficult urination are less common signs of endometrial cancer The uterus may also fill with pus pyometrea Of women with these less common symptoms vaginal discharge pelvic pain and pus 10 15 have cancer
Neu Laxova syndrome presents with severe malformations leading to prenatal or neonatal death Typically NLS involves characteristic facial features decreased fetal movements and skin abnormalities Fetuses or newborns with Neu Laxova syndrome have typical facial characteristics which include proptosis bulging eyes with eyelid malformations nose malformations round and gaping mouth micrognathia small jaw and low set or malformed ears Additional facial malformations may be present such as cleft lip or cleft palate Limb malformations are common and involve the fingers syndactyly hands or feet Additionally edema and flexion deformities are often present Other features of NLS are severe intrauterine growth restriction skin abnormalities ichthyosis and hyperkeratosis and decreased movement Malformations in the central nervous system are frequent and may include microcephaly lissencephaly or microgyria hypoplasia of the cerebellum and agenesis of the corpus callosum Other malformations may also be present such as neural tube defects
The symptoms of Leigh syndrome are classically described as beginning in infancy and leading to death within a span of several years however as more cases are recognized it is apparent that symptoms can emerge at any age including adolescence or adulthood and patients can survive for many years following diagnosis Symptoms are often first seen after a triggering event that taxes the bodys energy production such as an infection or surgery The general course of Leigh syndrome is one of episodic developmental regression during times of metabolic stress Some patients have long periods without disease progression while others develop progressive decline Infants with the syndrome have symptoms that include diarrhea vomiting and dysphagia trouble swallowing or sucking leading to a failure to thrive Children with early Leigh disease also may appear irritable and cry much more than healthy babies Seizures are often seen Excess lactate may be seen in the urine cerebrospinal fluid and blood of a person with Leigh syndrome As the disease progresses the muscular system is debilitated throughout the body as the brain cannot control the contraction of muscles Hypotonia low muscle tone and strength dystonia involuntary sustained muscle contraction and ataxia lack of control over movement are often seen in people with Leigh disease The eyes are particularly affected the muscles that control the eyes become weak paralyzed or uncontrollable in conditions called ophthalmoparesis weakness or paralysis and nystagmus involuntary eye movements Slow saccades are also sometimes seen The heart and lungs can also fail as a result of Leigh disease Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy thickening of part of the heart muscle is also sometimes found and can cause death asymmetric septal hypertrophy has also been associated with Leigh syndrome In children with Leigh syndrome associated ventricular septal defects caused by pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency high forehead and large ears are seen facial abnormalities are not typical of Leigh syndrome However respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people with Leigh syndrome Other neurological symptoms include peripheral neuropathy loss of sensation in extremities caused by damage to the peripheral nervous system Hypertrichosis is seen in Leigh syndrome caused by mutations in the nuclear gene SURF1
Delusions of negation are the central symptom in Cotards syndrome The patient usually denies their own existence the existence of a certain body part or the existence of a portion of their body Cotards syndrome exists in three stages
Uvietis Glaucoma and Hyphema are the classic sins of UGH syndrome but the term is often used when one two or all three signs are present in the presence of any IOL causing mechanical irritation of the iris or angle structures Blurred vision transient vision loss eye pain photophobia erythropsia objects appear red are the main symptoms
The main symptom of DTDS presenting in 80 99 of DTDS patients is Parkinsonism This is a neurological anomaly resulting from degeneration of dopamine generating cells in the substantia nigra and is characterized by shaking and tremors rigidity slowness of movement and difficulty with walking and gait Various other symptoms present less commonly 30 79 including bradykinesia slowness of movement acid reflux muscular hypertonia and chorea
Most branchial cleft cysts present in late childhood or early adulthood as a solitary painless mass which went previously unnoticed that has now become infected typically after an upper respiratory tract infection Fistulas if present are asymptomatic until infection arises
Spider angiomas are found only in the distribution of the superior vena cava and are thus commonly found on the face neck upper part of the torso and arms
Along with the four aspects of the disorder that give it its name there are also other common symptoms A downward slant of the forehead Delayed bone maturation Mental retardationThe ocular abnormalities are generally retinal coloboma and nystagmus
It is most commonly seen in females It is reported among patients from lower socioeconomic groups The nasal cavities become roomy and are filled with foul smelling crusts which are black or dark green and dry making expiration painful and difficult Microorganisms are known to multiply and produce a foul smell from the nose though the patients may not be aware of this because the nerve endings responsible for the perception of smell have become atrophied This is called merciful anosmia Patients usually complain of nasal obstruction despite the roomy nasal cavity which can be caused either by the obstruction produced by the discharge in the nose or as a result of sensory loss due to atrophy of nerves in the nose so the patient is unaware of the air flow In the case of the second cause the sensation of obstruction is subjective Bleeding from the nose also called epistaxis may occur when the dried discharge crusts are removed Septal perforation and dermatitis of nasal vestibule can occur The nose may show a saddle nose deformity Atrophic rhinitis is also associated with similar atrophic changes in the pharynx or larynx producing symptoms pertaining to these structures Hearing impairment can occur due to Eustachian tube blockage causing middle ear effusion
Signs and symptoms depend on the specific disease but motor neuron diseases typically manifest as a group of movement related symptoms They come on slowly and worsen over the course of more than three months Various patterns of muscle weakness are seen and muscle cramps and spasms may occur One can have difficulty breathing with climbing stairs exertion difficulty breathing when lying down orthopnea or even respiratory failure if breathing muscles become involved Bulbar symptoms including difficulty speaking dysarthria difficulty swallowing dysphagia and excessive saliva production sialorrhea can also occur Sensation or the ability to feel is typically not affected Emotional disturbance e g pseudobulbar affect and cognitive and behavioural changes e g problems in word fluency decision making and memory are also seen There can be lower motor neuron findings e g muscle wasting muscle twitching upper motor neuron findings e g brisk reflexes Babinski reflex Hoffmans reflex increased muscle tone or both Motor neuron diseases are seen both in children and adults Those that affect children tend to be inherited or familial and their symptoms are either present at birth or appear before learning to walk Those that affect adults tend to appear after age 40 The clinical course depends on the specific disease but most progress or worsen over the course of months Some are fatal e g ALS while others are not e g PLS
Pain on the outer part of the elbow lateral epicondyle Point tenderness over the lateral epicondyle a prominent part of the bone on the outside of the elbow Pain with resisted wrist extension or passive wrist flexionSymptoms associated with tennis elbow include but are not limited to pain from the outside of the elbow to the forearm and wrist and pain during extension of wrist
Onset occurs in the first decade usually between ages 5 and 9 The disorder is progressive vision changes with ageing from 2nd decade to 3rd visual impairment may seen in 4th and 5th decade severe visual impairment can be seen Minute gray punctate opacities develop Corneal sensitivity is usually reduced Painful attacks with photophobia foreign body sensations and recurrent erosions occur in most patients Macular corneal dystrophy is very common in Iceland and accounts for almost one third of all corneal grafts performed there
Painless hepatomegaly and splenomegaly the size of the spleen can be 1500 3000 g as opposed to the normal size of 50 200 g Splenomegaly may decrease the affected individuals capacity for eating by exerting pressure on the stomach While painless enlargement of spleen increases the risk of splenic rupture Hypersplenism and pancytopenia the rapid and premature destruction of blood cells leads to anemia neutropenia leukopenia and thrombocytopenia with an increased risk of infection and bleeding Cirrhosis of the liver is rare Severe pain associated with joints and bones occurs frequently presenting in hips and knees Neurological symptoms occur only in some types of Gauchers see below Type I impaired olfaction and cognition Type II serious convulsions hypertonia intellectual disability and apnea Type III muscle twitches known as myoclonus convulsions dementia and ocular muscle apraxia Parkinsons disease is recognized as being more common in Gauchers disease patients and their heterozygous carrier relatives Osteoporosis 75 of patients develop visible bony abnormalities due to the accumulated glucosylceramide A deformity of the distal femur in the shape of an Erlenmeyer flask is commonly described Yellowish brown skin pigmentation
Afibrinogenemia is typically the most severe of the three disorders Common symptoms include bleeding of the umbilical cord at birth traumatic and surgical bleeding GI tract oral and mucosal bleeding spontaneous splenic rupture and rarely intracranial hemorrhage and articular bleeding Symptoms of hypofibrinogenemia varies from mild to severe but can include bleeding of the GI tract oral and mucosal bleeding and very rarely intracranial bleeding More commonly it presents during traumatic bleeding or surgical procedures Most cases 60 of dysfibrinogenemia are asymptomatic but 28 exhibit hemorrhaging similar to that described above while 20 exhibit thrombosis i e excessive clotting
Uterine inversion is often associated with significant postpartum bleeding Traditionally it was thought that it presented with haemodynamic shock out of proportion with blood loss however blood loss has often been underestimated The parasympathetic effect of traction on the uterine ligaments may cause bradycardia
The following symptoms are typical ones which lead to testing for JMML though children with JMML may exhibit any combination of them pallor fever infection bleeding cough poor weight gain a maculopapular rash discolored but not raised or small and raised but not containing pus lymphadenopathy enlarged lymph nodes moderate hepatomegaly enlarged liver marked splenomegaly enlarged spleen leukocytosis high white blood cell count in blood absolute monocytosis high monocyte count in blood anemia low red blood cell count in blood and thrombocytopenia low platelet count in blood Most of these conditions are common nonspecific signs and symptoms Children with JMML and neurofibromatosis 1 NF1 about 14 of children with JMML are also clinically diagnosed with NF1 though up to 30 carry the NF1 gene mutation may also exhibit any of the following symptoms associated with NF1 in general only young children with NF1 are at an increased risk of developing JMML 6 or more café au lait flat coffee colored spots on the skin 2 or more neurofibromas pea size bumps that are noncancerous tumors on or under the skin Plexiform neurofibromas larger areas on skin that appear swollen Optic glioma a tumor on the optic nerve that affects vision Freckles under the arms or in the groin 2 or more Lisch nodules tiny tan or brown colored spots on the iris of the eye Various bone deformations including bowing of the legs below the knee scoliosis or thinning of the shin boneNoonan syndrome NS may predispose to the development of JMML or a myeloproliferative disorder MPD associated with NS MPD NS which resembles JMML in the first weeks of life However MPD NS may resolve without treatment Children with JMML and Noonans syndrome may also exhibit any of the following most common symptoms associated with Noonans syndrome Congenital heart defects in particular pulmonic stenosis a narrowing of the valve from the heart to the lungs Undescended testicles in males Excess skin and low hair line on back of neck Widely set eyes Diamond shaped eyebrows Ears that are low set backward rotated thick outer rim Deeply grooved philtrum upper lip line Learning delays
Usually a SCFE causes groin pain but it may cause pain in only the thigh or knee because the pain may be referred along the distribution of the obturator nerve The pain may occur on both sides of the body bilaterally as up to 40 percent of cases involve slippage on both sides In cases of bilateral SCFEs they typically occur within one year of each other About 20 percent of all cases include a SCFE on both sides at the time of presentation Signs of a SCFE include a waddling gait decreased range of motion Often the range of motion in the hip is restricted in internal rotation abduction and flexion A person with a SCFE may prefer to hold their hip in flexion and external rotation
The symptoms of blastomycosis cover a wide range overlapping with more common conditions for this reason blastomycosis has often been called the great pretender Many cases are asymptomatic or subclinical Lung symptoms are common because the lungs are infected in 79 of blastomycosis cases However in 25 40 of cases the disease also disseminates to other organs including the skin The extent and severity of symptoms depends in part on a persons immune status less than 50 of healthy people with blastomycosis have symptoms while immunocompromised patients are especially likely to have the disease spread beyond the lungs to other organs like the skin and bones Blastomycosis manifests as a primary lung infection in about 79 of cases The onset is relatively slow and symptoms are suggestive of bacterial pneumonia often leading to initial treatment with antibacterials Because the symptoms are variable and nonspecific blastomycosis is often not even considered in differential diagnosis until antibacterial treatment has failed unless there are known risk factors or skin lesions The disease may be misdiagnosed as a carcinoma leading in some cases to surgical removal of the affected tissue Upper lung lobes are involved somewhat more frequently than lower lobes If untreated many cases progress over a period of months to years to become disseminated blastomycosis Blastomycosis in the lungs may present a variety of symptoms or no symptoms at all If symptoms are present they may range from mild pneumonia resembling a pneumococcal infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS Common symptoms include fever chills headache coughing difficulty breathing chest pain and malaise Without treatment cases may progress to chronic pneumonia or ARDS ARDS is an uncommon but dangerous manifestation of blastomycosis It was seen in 9 of 72 blastomycosis cases studied in northeast Tennessee Such cases may follow massive exposure such during brush clearing operations In the Tennessee study the fatality rate was 89 in the ARDS cases but only 10 in the non ARDS cases In disseminated blastomycosis the large Blastomyces yeast cells translocate from the lungs and are trapped in capillary beds elsewhere in the body where they cause lesions The skin is the most common organ affected being the site of lesions in approximately 60 of cases The signature image of blastomycosis in textbooks is the indolent verrucous or ulcerated dermal lesion seen in disseminated disease Osteomyelitis is also common 12 60 of cases Other recurring sites of dissemination are the genitourinary tract kidney prostate epididymis collectively ca 25 of cases and the brain 3 10 of cases 40 of immunocompromised individuals have CNS involvement and present as brain abscess epidural abscess or meningitis Blastomycosis in non lung organs such as the skin may present a very wide range of symptoms including the following
Most young children do not show any physical signs of FXS It is not until puberty that physical features of FXS begin to develop Aside from intellectual disability prominent characteristics of the syndrome may include an elongated face large or protruding ears flat feet larger testes macroorchidism and low muscle tone Recurrent otitis media middle ear infection and sinusitis is common during early childhood Speech may be cluttered or nervous Behavioral characteristics may include stereotypic movements e g hand flapping and atypical social development particularly shyness limited eye contact memory problems and difficulty with face encoding Some individuals with fragile X syndrome also meet the diagnostic criteria for autism Males with a full mutation display virtually complete penetrance and will therefore almost always display symptoms of FXS while females with a full mutation generally display a penetrance of about 50 as a result of having a second normal X chromosome Females with FXS may have symptoms ranging from mild to severe although they are generally less affected than males
Usually the first respiratory symptoms are shortness of breath dyspnea and paradoxical respirations which then escalate within the first few months of life to diaphragmatic paralysis The symptoms of diaphragmatic paralysis come on very rapidly and without warning and the patient is often rushed to a hospital where they are placed on a ventilator for respiratory support Due to the severe nature of diaphragmatic paralysis the patient eventually needs continuous ventilation support to survive Continuous ventilation however may in itself cause damage to the anatomy of the lungs In addition to diaphragmatic paralysis other issues may arise as the name suggests the distal limbs are most affected with symptoms of weakness restricting mobility due to near paralysis of the distal limbs as well as the head and neck Also dysfunction of the peripheral nerves and the autonomic nervous system may occur Due to these dysfunctions the patients have been shown to suffer from excessive sweating and irregular heartbeat The deep tendon reflex is also lost in patients with DSMA1 Uterine growth retardation and poor foetal movement have been observed in severe DSMA1 cases
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS describes the presentation of this condition as follows A baby born with anencephaly is usually blind deaf unaware of its surroundings and unable to feel pain Although some individuals with anencephaly may be born with a main brain stem the lack of a functioning cerebrum permanently rules out the possibility of ever gaining awareness of their surroundings Reflex actions such as breathing and responses to sound or touch may occur Due to the presence of the brainstem children with anencephaly have almost all the primitive reflexes of a newborn responding to auditory vestibular and painful stimuli This means that the child can move smile suckle and breathe without the aid of devices
Symptoms of hypovolemic shock can be related to volume depletion electrolyte imbalances or acid base disorders that accompany hypovolemic shock Patients with volume depletion may complain of thirst muscle cramps and or orthostatic hypotension Severe hypovolemic shock can result in mesenteric and coronary ischemia that can cause abdominal or chest pain Agitation lethargy or confusion may characterize brain mal perfusion Dry mucous membranes decreased skin turgor low jugular venous distention tachycardia and hypotension can be seen along with decreased urinary output Patients in shock can appear cold clammy and cyanotic Early signs and symptoms include tachycardia given rise to by catecholamine release skin pallor due to vasoconstriction triggered by catecholamine release hypotension followed by hypovolaemia and perhaps arising after myocardial insufficiency and confusion aggression drowsiness and coma caused by cerebral hypoxia or acidosis Tachypnoea owing to hypoxia and acidosis general weakness caused by hypoxia and acidosis thirst induced by hypovolaemia and oliguria caused by reduced perfusion may also arise Abnormal growing central venous pressure indicates either hypotension or hypovolemia Tachycardia accompanied by declined urine outflow implies either tension pneumothorax cardiac tamponade or cardiac failure which is thought secondary to cardiac contusion or ischaemic heart disease Echocardiography in such case may be helpful to distinguish cardiac failure from other diseases Cardiac failure manifests a weak contractibility myocardium treatment with an inotropic drug such as dobutamine may be appropriate
EFE is characterized by a thickening of the innermost lining of the heart chambers the endocardium due to an increase in the amount of supporting connective tissue and elastic fibres It is an uncommon cause of unexplained heart failure in infants and children and is one component of HEC syndrome Fibroelastosis is strongly seen as a primary cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy in children along with cardiac amyloidosis which is more commonly seen in progressive multiple myeloma patients and the elderly
The skeletal structures of individuals who have this disorder may have pronounced deformities As reported by several medical doctors the following features are commonly found in people who with nail patella syndrome Bones and joints
Trimethylamine is most noticeable in urine as it is captured concentrated and released in intervals Fishy smelling urine is a primary identifying symptom in infant children Trimethylaminuria literally meaning trimethylamine in urine Trimethylamine is also released in the persons sweat reproductive fluids and breath and can give off a fishy odor when the concentration of trimethylamine is high enough to be detected The intensity of the smell is directly correlated with the concentration of trimethylamine in the bloodstream Some people with trimethylaminuria report having a strong odor all the time but when in a clinical setting most have only moderate to no smell depending on diet and the severity of their FM03 mutation In a study by Wise PM of 115 identified tmau subjects 0 had a smell detectable at a social distance and only 5 had some minor malodour when sniffing their palms After a choline challenge load test intentionally ingesting a TMA precursor only 10 expressed a smell at a social distance suggesting that those that produced odour had a more severe form of FMO3 impairment Smell events are often sporadic and episodic in nature based on diet over the previous 24 hours making it often difficult to diagnose by smell alone Individuals with this condition do not have any physical symptoms and they typically appear healthy The condition seems to be more common in women than men for unknown reasons Scientists suspect that such female sex hormones as progesterone and estrogen aggravate the condition According to several reports the condition worsens around puberty In women symptoms may worsen just before and during menstrual periods after taking oral contraceptives and around menopause The odor seems to vary depending on many known factors including diet hormonal changes stress level amount of sweat other odors in the space and the observers sense of smell
Symptoms include
There is considerable variability in the phenotype of Loeys Dietz syndrome from mild features to severe systemic abnormalities The primary manifestations of Loeys Dietz syndrome are arterial tortuosity winding course of blood vessels widely spaced eyes hypertelorism wide or split uvula and aneurysms at the aortic root Other features may include cleft palate and a blue gray appearance of the white of the eyes Cardiac defects and club foot may be noted at birth There is overlap in the manifestations of Loeys Dietz and Marfan syndromes including increased risk of ascending aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection abnormally long limbs and fingers and dural ectasia a gradual stretching and weakening of the dura mater that can cause abdominal and leg pain Findings of hypertelorism widely spaced eyes bifid or split uvula and skin findings such as easy bruising or abnormal scars may distinguish Loeys Dietz from Marfan syndrome Affected individuals often develop immune system related problems such as allergies to food asthma hay fever and inflammatory disorders such as eczema or inflammatory bowel disease Findings of Loeys Dietz syndrome may include Skeletal spinal malformations craniosynostosis Scoliosis spinal instability and spondylolisthesis Kyphosis Sternal abnormalities pectus excavatum pectus carinatum Contractures of fingers and toes camptodactyly Long fingers and lax joints Weakened or missing eye muscles strabismus Club foot Premature fusion of the skull bones craniosynostosis Joint hypermobility Congenital heart problems including patent ductus arteriosus connection between the aorta and the lung circulation and atrial septal defect connection between heart chambers Translucency of the skin with velvety texture Abnormal junction of the brain and medulla Arnold Chiari malformation Bicuspid aortic valves Criss crossed pulmonary arteries
Symptoms for Alström syndrome generally appear during infancy with great variability in age Some of the symptoms include Heart failure dilated cardiomyopathy in over 60 of cases usually within the first few weeks after birth but sometimes the onset is in adolescence or adulthood Light sensitivity and vision problems cone rod dystrophy in all cases usually within 15 months of birth and progressively worsening until about 20 years of age Delays in early developmental milestones in 50 of cases learning disabilities in about 30 of cases Obesity in 100 of cases apparent by 5 years of age but often apparent in infancy Alström infants usually have normal birth weights and by adolescence weights tend to be in the high normal to normal range Nystagmus usually affects the children one of the first symptoms to occur which causes involuntary rapid eye movement Mild to moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss Type 2 diabetes usually occurs in early childhood Hyperinsulinemia insulin resistance development of high level of insulin in blood Hypertriglyceridemia Steatosis fatty liver and elevated transaminases liver enzymes often develop in childhood and can progress in some patients to cirrhosis and liver failure Endocrine dysfunctions may occur where the patient may experience an under or over active thyroid gland weak growth hormone increased androgen in females and low testosterone in males Slowly progressive kidney failure can occur in the second to fourth decade of life
Staph infection is typically characterized by redness pus swelling and tenderness in areas of the infection But each type of skin infection caused by staph bacteria is different A few common skin infections caused by staph bacteria are
The main symptoms of delirium tremens are nightmares agitation global confusion disorientation visual and auditory hallucinations tactile hallucinations fever high blood pressure heavy sweating and other signs of autonomic hyperactivity fast heart rate and high blood pressure These symptoms may appear suddenly but typically develop two to three days after the stopping of heavy drinking being worst on the fourth or fifth day These symptoms are characteristically worse at night In general DT is considered the most severe manifestation of alcohol withdrawal and occurs 3 10 days following the last drink Other common symptoms include intense perceptual disturbance such as visions of insects snakes or rats These may be hallucinations or illusions related to the environment e g patterns on the wallpaper or in the peripheral vision that the patient falsely perceives as a resemblance to the morphology of an insect and are also associated with tactile hallucinations such as sensations of something crawling on the subject a phenomenon known as formication Delirium tremens usually includes extremely intense feelings of impending doom Severe anxiety and feelings of imminent death are common DT symptoms DT can sometimes be associated with severe uncontrollable tremors of the extremities and secondary symptoms such as anxiety panic attacks and paranoia Confusion is often noticeable to onlookers as those with DT will have trouble forming simple sentences or making basic logical calculations DT should be distinguished from alcoholic hallucinosis the latter of which occurs in approximately 20 of hospitalized alcoholics and does not carry a risk of significant mortality In contrast DT occurs in 5 10 of alcoholics and carries up to 15 mortality with treatment and up to 35 mortality without treatment
The main symptom is usually severe central chest pain Other symptoms include laboured breathing voice distortion as with helium and subcutaneous emphysema specifically affecting the face neck and chest Pneumomediastinum can also be characterized by the shortness of breath that is typical of a respiratory system problem It is often recognized on auscultation by a crunching sound timed with the cardiac cycle Hammans crunch Pneumomediastinum may also present with symptoms mimicking cardiac tamponade as a result of the increased intrapulmonary pressure on venous flow to the heart
Common symptoms of OSA syndrome include unexplained daytime sleepiness restless sleep and loud snoring with periods of silence followed by gasps Less common symptoms are morning headaches insomnia trouble concentrating mood changes such as irritability anxiety and depression forgetfulness increased heart rate or blood pressure decreased sex drive unexplained weight gain increased urinary frequency or nocturia frequent heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux and heavy night sweats Many people experience episodes of OSA for only a short period This can be the result of an upper respiratory infection that causes nasal congestion along with swelling of the throat or tonsillitis that temporarily produces very enlarged tonsils The Epstein Barr virus for example is known to be able to dramatically increase the size of lymphoid tissue during acute infection and OSA is fairly common in acute cases of severe infectious mononucleosis Temporary spells of OSA syndrome may also occur in individuals who are under the influence of a drug such as alcohol that may relax their body tone excessively and interfere with normal arousal from sleep mechanisms
People report anterior knee pain often with an aching quality The symptom onset is insidious Rarely is a discrete injury described Usually the problem is below the kneecap but it may also be above Jumpers knee can be classified into 1 of 4 stages as follows Stage 1 Pain only after activity without functional impairment Stage 2 Pain during and after activity although the person is still able to perform satisfactorily in his or her sport Stage 3 Prolonged pain during and after activity with increasing difficulty in performing at a satisfactory level Stage 4 Complete tendon tear requiring surgical repair It begins as inflammation in the patellar tendon where it attaches to the patella and may progress by tearing or degenerating the tendon People present with an ache over the patella tendon Most people are between 10 and 16 years old Magnetic resonance imaging can reveal edema increased T2 signal intensity in the proximal aspect of the patellar tendon
Primary visible signs of ocular lymphoma include proptosis and a visible mass in the eye Symptoms are due to mass effect
SSPE is characterized by a history of primary measles infection followed by an asymptomatic period that lasts 7 years on average but can range from 1 month to 27 years After the asymptomatic period progressive neurological deterioration occurs characterized by behavior change intellectual problems myoclonic seizures blindness ataxia and eventually death
Among the signs of subacute bacterial endocarditis are Malaise Weakness Excessive sweat Fever
The color of peripheral ossifying fibromas ranges from red to pink and is frequently ulcerated It can be sessile or pedunculated with the size usually being less than 2 cm Weeks or months may pass by before it is seen and diagnosed There is a gender difference with 66 of the disease occurring in females The prevalence of peripheral ossifying fibromas is highest around 10 19 years of age It appears only on the gingiva more often on the maxilla rather than the mandible and is frequently found in the area around incisors and canines The adjacent teeth are usually not affected Peripheral ossifying fibromas appear microscopically as a combination of a mineralized product and fibrous proliferation The mineralized portion may be bone cementum like or dystrophic calcifications Additionally highly developed bone or cementum is more likely to be present when the peripheral ossifying fibroma has existed for a longer period of time
Characteristic symptoms vary with severity In general symptoms are internal or external bleeding episodes which are called bleeds People with more severe haemophilia experience more severe and more frequent bleeds while people with mild haemophilia usually experience more minor symptoms except after surgery or serious trauma In cases of moderate haemophilia symptoms are variable which manifest along a spectrum between severe and mild forms In both haemophilia A and B there is spontaneous bleeding but a normal bleeding time normal prothrombin time normal thrombin time but prolonged partial thromboplastin time Internal bleeding is common in people with severe haemophilia and some individuals with moderate haemophilia The most characteristic type of internal bleed is a joint bleed where blood enters into the joint spaces This is most common with severe haemophiliacs and can occur spontaneously without evident trauma If not treated promptly joint bleeds can lead to permanent joint damage and disfigurement Bleeding into soft tissues such as muscles and subcutaneous tissues is less severe but can lead to damage and requires treatment Children with mild to moderate haemophilia may not have any signs or symptoms at birth especially if they do not undergo circumcision Their first symptoms are often frequent and large bruises and haematomas from frequent bumps and falls as they learn to walk Swelling and bruising from bleeding in the joints soft tissue and muscles may also occur Children with mild haemophilia may not have noticeable symptoms for many years Often the first sign in very mild haemophiliacs is heavy bleeding from a dental procedure an accident or surgery Females who are carriers usually have enough clotting factors from their one normal gene to prevent serious bleeding problems though some may present as mild haemophiliacs
Ulegyria was found in about 1 3 of patients with defects caused by circulatory disease in the perinatal period Most clinical observations of the condition report mental retardation cerebral palsy and seizures as the main defects However milder cases have been reported in which patients that exhibit ulegyria develop relatively normally The main movement disorders associated with ulegyria that are classified as cerebral palsy are choreoathetosis dystonia and ataxia It is suspected that ulegyria leads to epilepsy because malformation of the cortex obstructs the differentiation of neurons glial cells and synapses Parietal occipital lobe epilepsy which is often synonymous with posterior cortex epilepsy PCE is the form of the disease seen in most cases involving ulegyria This type of epilepsy is very rare making up about 5 of all reports of epilepsy This form of the disease involves symptoms that would be expected from damage to the parietal and occipital lobes seizures with visual hallucinations visuospatial dysfunction tingling numbness pain and a burning sensation In addition to ulegyria tumors and cortical dysplasia constitute the major causes of PCE Most of the epilepsy seen in conjunction with ulegyria is classified as medically refractory meaning it is not responsive to treatment Patients usually present symptoms of epilepsy at an early age The severity of epilepsy has been shown to depend on this age of onset as well as the quantity of cortical lesions earlier onset of epilepsy and a larger extent of lesions tends to mean more severe seizures
As with other types of fractures scapular fracture may be associated with pain localized to the area of the fracture tenderness swelling and crepitus the crunching sound of bone ends grinding together Since scapular fractures impair the motion of the shoulder a person with a scapular fracture has a reduced ability to move the shoulder joint Signs and symptoms may be masked by other injuries that accompany the scapular fracture
Myoclonus dystonia is characterized by two primary features myoclonus and dystonia For the majority of individuals with myoclonus dystonia the myoclonus component of the disorder is often the primary and most disabling feature in comparison to the dystonia component The symptoms of myoclonus dystonia vary substantially in severity
Initially a vascular lesion is usually noted on the skin which can be firm and hard indurated Areas of tiny red dots petechiae can appear around the lesion or on other parts of the body If the vascular lesion is internal these petechiae and bruising can be seen on the skin Bruising and spontaneous bleeding can also occur The tumors are not hemangiomas They usually present in young infants less than three months of age but have also been reported in the toddler age group These tumors occur in the extremities chest neck abdomen and pelvis They infiltrate across tissue and can be aggravated by interventions infection and trauma When the tumors associated with KMP are internal such as in the chest or abdomen they can cause significant illness and can be life threatening due to bleeding Internal lesions can take a longer time to diagnose
Acute symptoms of copper poisoning by ingestion include vomiting hematemesis vomiting of blood hypotension low blood pressure melena black tarry feces coma jaundice yellowish pigmentation of the skin and gastrointestinal distress Individuals with glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may be at increased risk of hematologic effects of copper Hemolytic anemia resulting from the treatment of burns with copper compounds is infrequent Chronic long term copper exposure can damage the liver and kidneys Mammals have efficient mechanisms to regulate copper stores such that they are generally protected from excess dietary copper levels Those same protection mechanisms can cause milder symptoms which are often misdiagnosed as psychiatric disorders There is a lot of research on the function of the Cu Zn ratio in neurological endocrinological and psychological conditions Many of the substances that protect us from excess copper perform important functions in our neurological and endocrine systems leading to diagnostic difficulties When they are used to bind copper in the plasma to prevent it from being absorbed in the tissues their own function may go unfulfilled Such symptoms often include mood swings irritability depression fatigue excitation difficulty focusing and feeling out of control To further complicate diagnosis some symptoms of excess copper are similar to those of a copper deficit The U S Environmental Protection Agencys Maximum Contaminant Level MCL in drinking water is 1 3 milligrams per liter The MCL for copper is based on the expectation that a lifetime of consuming copper in water at this level is without adverse effect gastrointestinal The US EPA lists copper as a micronutrient and a toxin Toxicity in mammals includes a wide range of animals and effects such as liver cirrhosis necrosis in kidneys and the brain gastrointestinal distress lesions low blood pressure and fetal mortality The Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has set a limit of 0 1 mg m3 for copper fumes vapor generated from heating copper and 1 mg m3 for copper dusts fine metallic copper particles and mists aerosol of soluble copper in workroom air during an eight hour work shift 40 hour work week Toxicity to other species of plants and animals is noted to varying levels
Symptoms generally arise later after one takes a shower It is unusual to notice the eruptions immediately Symptoms can last from a few days up to two weeks the shorter time being the norm The reaction is identified by severe itching around small red papules 1mm to 1 5 cm in size located on areas of skin that were covered by water permeable clothing or hair during ocean swimming Initial swimmer exposure to the free floating larvae produces no effects as each organism possesses only a single undeveloped nematocyst which is inactive while suspended in seawater However due to their microscopic size and sticky bodies large concentrations of larvae can become trapped in minute gaps between skin and clothing or hair Once the swimmer leaves the ocean the organisms stuck against the skin die and automatically discharge their nematocysts when crushed dried out or exposed to freshwater This is why symptoms usually do not appear until the swimmer dries themselves in the sun or takes a freshwater shower without first removing the affected clothing
Head pain occurs in 50 75 of all cases of vertebral artery dissection It tends to be located at the back of the head either on the affected side or in the middle and develops gradually It is either dull or pressure like in character or throbbing About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct while the remainder have had a similar headache before It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common 8 of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone Obstruction of blood flow through the affected vessel may lead to dysfunction of part of the brain supplied by the artery This happens in 77 96 of cases This may be temporary transient ischemic attack in 10 16 of cases but many 67 85 of cases end up with a permanent deficit or a stroke The vertebral artery supplies the part of the brain that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation infarct Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing lateral medullary syndrome this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem Others may experience unsteadiness or lack of coordination due to involvement of the cerebellum and still others may develop visual loss on one side of the visual field due to involvement of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem a partial Horners syndrome may develop this is the combination of a drooping eyelid constricted pupil and an apparently sunken eye on one side of the face If the dissection of the artery extends to the part of the artery that lies inside the skull subarachnoid hemorrhage may occur 1 of cases This arises due to rupture of the artery and accumulation of blood in the subarachnoid space It may be characterized by a different usually severe headache it may also cause a range of additional neurological symptoms 13 16 of all people with vertebral or carotid dissection have dissection in another cervical artery It is therefore possible for the symptoms to occur on both sides or for symptoms of carotid artery dissection to occur at the same time as those of vertebral artery dissection Some give a figure of multiple vessel dissection as high as 30
Aortic stenosis Symptoms of aortic stenosis may include heart failure symptoms such as dyspnea on exertion most frequent symptom orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea angina pectoris and syncope usually exertional Medical signs of aortic stenosis include pulsus parvus et tardus that is diminished and delayed carotid pulse fourth heart sound decreased A2 sound sustained apex beat precordial thrill Auscultation may reveal a systolic murmur of a harsh crescendo decrescendo type heard in 2nd right intercostal space and radiating to the carotid arteries
Children born with Edwards syndrome may have some or all of these characteristics kidney malformations structural heart defects at birth i e ventricular septal defect atrial septal defect patent ductus arteriosus intestines protruding outside the body omphalocele esophageal atresia intellectual disability developmental delays growth deficiency feeding difficulties breathing difficulties and arthrogryposis a muscle disorder that causes multiple joint contractures at birth Some physical malformations associated with Edwards syndrome include small head microcephaly accompanied by a prominent back portion of the head occiput low set malformed ears abnormally small jaw micrognathia cleft lip cleft palate upturned nose narrow eyelid openings blepharophimosis widely spaced eyes ocular hypertelorism drooping of the upper eyelids ptosis a short breast bone clenched hands choroid plexus cysts underdeveloped thumbs and or nails absent radius webbing of the second and third toes clubfoot or rocker bottom feet and in males undescended testicles In utero the most common characteristic is cardiac anomalies followed by central nervous system anomalies such as head shape abnormalities The most common intracranial anomaly is the presence of choroid plexus cysts which are pockets of fluid on the brain These are not problematic in themselves but their presence may be a marker for trisomy 18 Sometimes excess amniotic fluid or polyhydramnios is exhibited Although uncommon in the syndrome Edwards syndrome causes a large portion of prenatally diagnosed cases of Dandy Walker malformation
In addition to symptoms related to the actual cause people with sepsis may have a fever low body temperature rapid breathing a fast heart rate confusion and edema Early signs include a rapid heart rate decreased urination and high blood sugar Signs of established sepsis include confusion metabolic acidosis which may be accompanied by a faster breathing rate that leads to respiratory alkalosis low blood pressure due to decreased systemic vascular resistance higher cardiac output and disorders in blood clotting that may lead to organ failure Fever is the most common presenting symptom in sepsis but fever may be absent in some people such as the elderly or those who are immunocompromised The drop in blood pressure seen in sepsis can cause lightheadedness and is part of the criteria for septic shock Oxidative stress is observed in septic shock with circulating levels of copper and vitamin C being decreased
Foot drop is characterized by steppage gait While walking people suffering the condition drag their toes along the ground or bend their knees to lift their foot higher than usual to avoid the dragging This serves to raise the foot high enough to prevent the toe from dragging and prevents the slapping To accommodate the toe drop the patient may use a characteristic tiptoe walk on the opposite leg raising the thigh excessively as if walking upstairs while letting the toe drop Other gaits such as a wide outward leg swing to avoid lifting the thigh excessively or to turn corners in the opposite direction of the affected limb may also indicate foot drop Patients with painful disorders of sensation dysesthesia of the soles of the feet may have a similar gait but do not have foot drop Because of the extreme pain evoked by even the slightest pressure on the feet the patient walks as if walking barefoot on hot sand
Bannayan Riley Ruvalcaba syndrome is associated with enlarged head and benign mesodermal hamartomas multiple hemangiomas and intestinal polyps Dysmorphy as well as delayed neuropsychomotor development can also be present The head enlargement does not cause widening of the ventricles or raised intracranial pressure these individuals have a higher risk of developing tumors as the gene involved in BRRs is phosphatase and tensin homologue Some individuals have thyroid issues consistent with multinodular goiter thyroid adenoma differentiated non medullary thyroid cancer most lesions are slowly growing Visceral as well as intracranial involvement may occur in some cases and can cause bleeding and symptomatic mechanical compression
Initial symptoms include psychiatric problems behavioral changes and painful sensations In the later stages of the illness patients may exhibit poor coordination dementia and involuntary movements The length of time between exposure and the development of symptoms is unclear but is believed to be years Average life expectancy following the onset of symptoms is 13 months
The most common symptoms of AEL are related to pancytopenia a shortage of all types of blood cells including fatigue infections and mucocutaneous bleeding Almost half of people with AEL exhibit weight loss fever and night sweats at the time of diagnosis Almost all people with AEL are anemic and 77 have a hemoglobin level under 10 0 g dl Signs of thrombocytopenia are found in about half of people with AEL
These conditions nearly all present with an insidious onset of pain referred to the location of the bony damage Some notably Kienbocks disease of the wrist may involve considerable swelling and Legg Calvé Perthes disease of the hip causes the victim to limp The spinal form Scheuermanns disease may cause bending or kyphosis of the upper spine giving a hunch back appearance
Severity and pain during vaginal penetration varies
Symptoms usually include one or more of the following orthopnea difficulty breathing while lying flat dyspnea shortness of breath on exertion pitting edema swelling cough frequent night time urination excessive weight gain during the last month of pregnancy 1 2 kg week two to four or more pounds per week palpitations sensation of racing heart rate skipping beats long pauses between beats or fluttering and chest pain The shortness of breath is often described by PPCM patients as the inability to take a deep or full breath or to get enough air into the lungs Also patients often describe the need to prop themselves up overnight by using two or more pillows in order to breathe better These symptoms swelling and or cough may be indications of pulmonary edema fluid in the lungs resulting from acute heart failure and PPCM Diagnosis may be delayed or dismissed as early symptoms may be interpreted as being typical of normal pregnancy Delays in diagnosis and treatment of PPCM are associated with increased morbidity and mortality It is also quite common for women to present with evidence of having an embolus clot passing from the heart to a vital organ causing such complications as stroke loss of circulation to a limb even coronary artery occlusion blockage with typical myocardial infarction heart attack For these reasons it is paramount that clinicians hold a high suspicion of PPCM in any peri or postpartum patient where unusual or unexplained symptoms or presentations occur
Infections by Mansonella perstans while often asymptomatic can be associated with angioedema pruritus fever headaches arthralgias and neurologic manifestations Mansonella streptocerca can manifest on the skin via pruritus papular eruptions and pigmentation changes Mansonella ozzardi can cause symptoms that include arthralgias headaches fever pulmonary symptoms adenopathy hepatomegaly and pruritus Eosinophilia is often prominent but do not occur in all cases of Mansonelliasis M perstans can also present with Calabar like swellings hives and a condition known as Kampala or Ugandan eye worm This occurs when adult M perstans invades the conjunctiva or periorbital connective tissues in the eye M perstans can also present with hydrocele in South America However it is often hard to distinguish between the symptoms of Mansonelliasis and other nematode infections endemic to the same areas
In many people symptoms are present for a considerable time before diagnosis The most common clinical features of IPF include the following Age over 50 years Dry non productive cough on exertion Progressive exertional dyspnea shortness of breath with exercise Dry inspiratory bibasilar velcro like crackles on auscultation a crackling sound in the lungs during inhalation similar to Velcro being torn apart slowly heard with a stethoscope Clubbing of the digits a disfigurement of the finger tips or toes see image Abnormal pulmonary function test results with evidence of restriction and impaired gas exchange Some of these features are due to chronic hypoxemia oxygen deficiency in the blood are not specific for IPF and can occur in other pulmonary disorders IPF should be considered in all patients with unexplained chronic exertional dyspnea who present with cough inspiratory bibasilar crackles or finger clubbing Assessment of velcro crackles on lung auscultation is a practical way to improve the earlier diagnosis of IPF Fine crackles are easily recognized by clinicians and are characteristic of IPF If bilateral fine crackles are present throughout the inspiratory time and are persisting after several deep breaths and if remaining present on several occasions several weeks apart in a subject aged 60 years this should raise the suspicion of IPF and lead to consideration of an HRCT scan of the chest which is more sensitive than a chest X ray As crackles are not specific for IPF they must prompt a thorough diagnostic process
Mild hypokalemia is often without symptoms although it may cause elevation of blood pressure and can provoke the development of an abnormal heart rhythm Severe hypokalemia with serum potassium concentrations of 2 5 3 meq L Nl 3 5 5 0 meq L may cause muscle weakness myalgia tremor and muscle cramps owing to disturbed function of skeletal muscle and constipation from disturbed function of smooth muscle With more severe hypokalemia flaccid paralysis and hyporeflexia may result Reports exist of rhabdomyolysis occurring with profound hypokalemia with serum potassium levels less than 2 meq L Respiratory depression from severe impairment of skeletal muscle function is found in some people It can also cause psychotic as well as other mental symptoms including hypokalemic sensory overstimulation
Abdominal pain Abdominal bloating Abdominal tenderness Fever Tachycardia rapid heart rate DehydrationThere may be signs of septic shock A physical examination reveals abdominal tenderness and possible loss of bowel sounds An abdominal radiography shows colonic dilation White blood cell count is usually elevated Severe sepsis may present with hypothermia or leukopenia
Merkel cell carcinoma MCC usually presents as a firm nodule up to 2 cm diameter or mass 2 cm diameter These flesh colored red or blue tumors typically vary in size from 0 5 cm less than one quarter of an inch to more than 5 cm 2 inches in diameter and may enlarge rapidly Tumors can present as painless tender or itchy and other MCC manifestations as papules or plaques have also been reported Although MCC may arise almost anywhere on the body it is most commonly found in sun exposed areas such as the head neck or extremities Five key attributes of MCC were summarized in 2008 in the acronym AEIOU Asymptomatic lack of tenderness Expanding rapidly Immune suppression Older than 50 years and Ultraviolet exposed site on a person with fair skin Ninety percent of MCCs have three or more of those features MCC is sometimes mistaken for other histological types of cancer including basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma malignant melanoma lymphoma and small cell carcinoma or as a benign cyst Merkel cell carcinomas have been described in children however pediatric cases are very rare Merkel cell cancers tend to invade locally infiltrating the underlying subcutaneous fat fascia and muscle and typically metastasize early in their natural history most often to the regional lymph nodes MCCs also spread aggressively through the blood vessels to many organs particularly to liver lung brain and bone
Signs and symptoms of portal hypertension include
A wide range of symptoms can indicate if a person has polymyalgia rheumatica The classic symptoms include Pain and stiffness moderate to severe in the neck shoulders upper arms thighs and hips which inhibits activity especially in the morning after sleeping Pain can also occur in the groin area and in the buttocks The pain can be limited to one of these areas as well It is a disease of the girdles meaning shoulder girdle or pelvic girdle Fatigue and lack of appetite possibly leading to weight loss Anemia An overall feeling of illness or flu like symptoms Low grade mild fever or abnormal temperature is sometimes present In most people it is characterized by constant fatigue weakness and sometimes exhaustion About 15 of people who are diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica also have temporal arteritis and about 50 of people with temporal arteritis have polymyalgia rheumatica Some symptoms of temporal arteritis include headaches scalp tenderness jaw or facial soreness distorted vision or aching in the limbs caused by decreased blood flow and fatigue
LNS is characterized by three major hallmarks neurologic dysfunction cognitive and behavioral disturbances including self mutilation and uric acid overproduction hyperuricemia Damage to the basal ganglia causes affected individuals to adopt a characteristic fencing stance due to the nature of the lesion Some may also have macrocytic anemia due to the faulty DNA synthesis most likely due to deficient purine synthesis that leads to a lag of cell division with respect to increases in cell mass Virtually all patients are male males experience delayed growth and puberty and most develop shrunken testicles or testicular atrophy Female carriers are at an increased risk for gouty arthritis but are usually otherwise unaffected
Many allergens such as dust or pollen are airborne particles In these cases symptoms arise in areas in contact with air such as the eyes nose and lungs For instance allergic rhinitis also known as hay fever causes irritation of the nose sneezing itching and redness of the eyes Inhaled allergens can also lead to increased production of mucus in the lungs shortness of breath coughing and wheezing Aside from these ambient allergens allergic reactions can result from foods insect stings and reactions to medications like aspirin and antibiotics such as penicillin Symptoms of food allergy include abdominal pain bloating vomiting diarrhea itchy skin and hives Food allergies rarely cause respiratory asthmatic reactions or rhinitis Insect stings food antibiotics and certain medicines may produce a systemic allergic response that is also called anaphylaxis multiple organ systems can be affected including the digestive system the respiratory system and the circulatory system Depending on the severity anaphylaxis can include skin reactions bronchoconstriction swelling low blood pressure coma and death This type of reaction can be triggered suddenly or the onset can be delayed The nature of anaphylaxis is such that the reaction can seem to be subsiding but may recur throughout a period of time
Iron deficiency anemia may be present without a person experiencing symptoms it tends to develop slowly therefore the body has time to adapt and the disease often goes unrecognized for some time If symptoms present patients may present with the sign of pallor reduced oxyhemoglobin in skin or mucous membranes and the symptoms of feeling tired weak dizziness lightheadedness poor physical exertion headaches decreased ability to concentrate cold hands and feet cold sensitivity increased thirst and confusion It may be accompanied by other symptoms such as hair loss and thinning cracked and dry lips and dark circles around the eyes None of these symptoms or any of the others below are sensitive or specific The symptom most suggestive of iron deficiency anemia in children is pallor of mucous membranes primarily the conjunctiva Even so a large study showed that pallor of the mucous membranes is only 28 sensitive and 87 specific with high predictive value in distinguishing children with anemia defined as hemoglobin 11 0 g dl and 49 sensitive and 79 specific in distinguishing severe anemia hemoglobin 7 0 g dl Thus this sign is reasonably predictive when present but not helpful when absent as only one third to one half of children who are anemic depending on severity will show pallor In severe cases shortness of breath can occur Pica may also develop of which consumption of ice known as pagophagia has been suggested to be the most specific for iron deficiency anemia Other possible symptoms and signs of iron deficiency anemia include
Symptoms of pouchitis include increased stool frequency urgency incontinence nocturnal seepage abdominal cramping pelvic discomfort and arthralgia Symptom severity does not always correlate with severity of endoscopically or histologically evaluated pouch inflammation Additionally these symptoms are not necessarily specific for pouchitis as they may arise from other inflammatory or functional pouch disorders such as Crohns disease of the pouch cuffitis pouch sinus or irritable pouch syndrome The most reliable tool for diagnosis is endoscopy combined with histologic features derived from tissue biopsies obtained during endoscopy
The clinical presentation is often dominated by the underlying cause The various symptoms of acute kidney injury result from the various disturbances of kidney function that are associated with the disease Accumulation of urea and other nitrogen containing substances in the bloodstream lead to a number of symptoms such as fatigue loss of appetite headache nausea and vomiting Marked increases in the potassium level can lead to abnormal heart rhythms which can be severe and life threatening Fluid balance is frequently affected though blood pressure can be high low or normal Pain in the flanks may be encountered in some conditions such as clotting of the kidneys blood vessels or inflammation of the kidney This is the result of stretching of the fibrous tissue capsule surrounding the kidney If the kidney injury is the result of dehydration there may be thirst as well as evidence of fluid depletion on physical examination Physical examination may also provide other clues as to the underlying cause of the kidney problem such as a rash in interstitial nephritis or vasculitis and a palpable bladder in obstructive nephropathy
Excessive urination and extreme thirst and increased fluid intake especially for cold water and sometimes ice or ice water are typical for DI The symptoms of excessive urination and extreme thirst are similar to what is seen in untreated diabetes mellitus with the distinction that the urine does not contain glucose Blurred vision is a rarity Signs of dehydration may also appear in some individuals since the body cannot conserve much if any of the water it takes in Extreme urination continues throughout the day and the night In children DI can interfere with appetite eating weight gain and growth as well They may present with fever vomiting or diarrhea Adults with untreated DI may remain healthy for decades as long as enough water is consumed to offset the urinary losses However there is a continuous risk of dehydration and loss of potassium that may lead to hypokalemia
Signs and symptoms may not appear for decades after the initial infection and include weakness diminished reflexes paresthesias shooting and burning pains pricking sensations and formication hypoesthesias abnormally diminished sense of touch tabetic gait locomotor ataxia progressive degeneration of the joints loss of coordination episodes of intense pain and disturbed sensation including glossodynia personality changes urinary incontinence dementia deafness visual impairment positive Rombergs test and impaired response to light Argyll Robertson pupil The skeletal musculature is hypotonic due to destruction of the sensory limb of the spindle reflex The deep tendon reflexes are also diminished or absent for example the knee jerk or patellar reflex may be lacking Westphals sign A complication of tabes dorsalis can be transient neuralgic paroxysmal pain affecting the eyes and the ophthalmic areas previously called Pels crises after Dutch physician P K Pel Now more commonly called tabetic ocular crises an attack is characterized by sudden intense eye pain tearing of the eyes and sensitivity to light Tabes dorsalgia is a related lancinating back pain Tabetic gait is a characteristic ataxic gait of untreated syphilis where the persons feet slap the ground as they strike the floor due to loss of proprioception In daylight the person can avoid some unsteadiness by watching their own feet
Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak years for the onset of bipolar disorder The condition is characterized by intermittent episodes of mania and or depression with an absence of symptoms in between During these episodes people with bipolar disorder exhibit disruptions in normal mood psychomotor activity the level of physical activity that is influenced by mood e g constant fidgeting during mania or slowed movements during depression circadian rhythm and cognition Mania can present with varying levels of mood disturbance ranging from euphoria which is associated with classic mania to dysphoria and irritability Psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations may occur in both manic and depressive episodes their content and nature are consistent with the persons prevailing mood According to the DSM 5 criteria mania is distinguished from hypomania by the duration hypomania is present if elevated mood symptoms persist for at least four consecutive days while mania is present if such symptoms persist for more than a week Unlike mania hypomania is not always associated with impaired functioning The biological mechanisms responsible for switching from a manic or hypomanic episode to a depressive episode or vice versa remain poorly understood
The clinical presentation varies depending on the stage of the disease from mild swelling to severe swelling and moderate deformity Inflammation erythema pain and increased skin temperature 3 7 degrees Celsius around the joint may be noticeable on examination X rays may reveal bone resorption and degenerative changes in the joint These findings in the presence of intact skin and loss of protective sensation are pathognomonic of acute Charcot arthropathy Roughly 75 of patients experience pain but it is less than what would be expected based on the severity of the clinical and radiographic findings
The Japanese encephalitis virus JEV has an incubation period of 2 to 26 days The vast majority of infections are asymptomatic only 1 in 250 infections develop into encephalitis Severe rigors may mark the onset of this disease in humans Fever headache and malaise are other non specific symptoms of this disease which may last for a period of between 1 and 6 days Signs which develop during the acute encephalitic stage include neck rigidity cachexia hemiparesis convulsions and a raised body temperature between 38 41 C 100 4 105 8 F The mortality rate of the disease is around 25 and is generally higher in children under five the immuno suppressed and the elderly Transplacental spread has been noted Neurological disorders develop in 40 of those who survive with lifelong neurological defects such as deafness emotional lability and hemiparesis occurring in those who had central nervous system involvement
CKD is initially without symptoms and is usually detected on routine screening blood work by either an increase in serum creatinine or protein in the urine As the kidney function decreases more unpleasant symptoms may emerge Blood pressure is increased due to fluid overload and production of vasoactive hormones created by the kidney via the renin angiotensin system increasing the risk of developing hypertension and heart failure People with CKD are more likely than the general population to develop atherosclerosis with consequent cardiovascular disease an effect that may be at least partly mediated by uremic toxins People with both CKD and cardiovascular disease have significantly worse prognoses than those with only cardiovascular disease Urea accumulates leading to azotemia and ultimately uremia symptoms ranging from lethargy to pericarditis and encephalopathy Due to its high systemic concentration urea is excreted in eccrine sweat at high concentrations and crystallizes on skin as the sweat evaporates uremic frost Potassium accumulates in the blood hyperkalemia with a range of symptoms including malaise and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias Hyperkalemia usually does not develop until the glomerular filtration rate falls to less than 20 25 mL min 1 73 m2 when the kidneys have decreased ability to excrete potassium Hyperkalemia in CKD can be exacerbated by acidemia which leads to extracellular shift of potassium and from lack of insulin Fluid overload symptoms may range from mild edema to life threatening pulmonary edema Hyperphosphatemia results from poor phosphate elimination in the kidney and contributes to increased cardiovascular risk by causing vascular calcification Circulating concentrations of fibroblast growth factor 23 FGF 23 increase progressively as the kidney capacity for phosphate excretion declines which may contribute to left ventricular hypertrophy and increased mortality in people with CKD Hypocalcemia results from 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 deficiency caused by high FGF 23 and reduced kidney mass and resistance to the action of parathyroid hormone Osteocytes are responsible for the increased production of FGF 23 which is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme 1 alpha hydroxylase responsible for the conversion of 25 hydroxycholecalciferol into 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 Later this progresses to secondary hyperparathyroidism kidney osteodystrophy and vascular calcification that further impairs cardiac function An extreme consequence is the occurrence of the rare condition named calciphylaxis Changes in mineral and bone metabolism that may cause 1 abnormalities of calcium phosphorus phosphate parathyroid hormone or vitamin D metabolism 2 abnormalities in bone turnover mineralization volume linear growth or strength kidney osteodystrophy and 3 vascular or other soft tissue calcification CKD mineral and bone disorders have been associated with poor outcomes Metabolic acidosis may result from decreased capacity to generate enough ammonia from the cells of the proximal tubule Acidemia affects the function of enzymes and increases excitability of cardiac and neuronal membranes by the promotion of hyperkalemia Anemia is common and is especially prevalent in those requiring haemodialysis It is multifactorial in cause but includes increased inflammation reduction in erythropoietin and hyperuricemia leading to bone marrow suppression Hypoproliferative anemia occurs due to inadequate production of erythropoietin by the kidneys In later stages cachexia may develop leading to unintentional weight loss muscle wasting weakness and anorexia Sexual dysfunction is very common in both men and women with CKD A majority of men have a reduced sex drive difficulty obtaining an erection and reaching orgasm and the problems get worse with age Most women have trouble with sexual arousal and painful menstruation and problems with performing and enjoying sex are common
Taeniasis generally has few or no symptoms It takes about 8 weeks from infection for adult worms to form and can last for years without treatment Infection may be suspected when a portion of the worm is passed in the stool It is not generally fatal
Pulmonary siderosis doesnt usually cause harmful scar tissue formation within the lungs which is why it said to be non fibrotic condition unlike asbestosis for example and has also been called benign pneumoconiosis Mild to moderate scarring of the lungs has been found in unusual cases of pulmonary siderosis These people have had persistent breathlessness coughing and decreased lung function However people in occupations where they are exposed to iron or rust dust are usually also exposed to other forms of dust such as silica which upon repeated inhalation is known to cause dangerous silicosis Because of this it is not known for certain whether the inhalation of pure iron or rust can cause detrimental scarring of the lungs that has been seen in some cases of pulmonary siderosis Still studies have shown lack of silica in tissue samples collected from people with pulmonary siderosis This indicates that iron alone is enough to cause damage to the lungs Symptoms usually appear after a number of years but may rarely appear within a year Eye exposure to iron dust can also cause another form of siderosis ocular siderosis or siderosis bulbi which can cause eye discoloration but also eye damage like cataracts and night blindness This happens via the corrosive effects of iron
Hallmark symptoms of ciguatera in humans include gastrointestinal cardiovascular and neurological effects Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea vomiting and diarrhea usually followed by neurological symptoms such as headaches muscle aches paresthesia numbness of extremities mouth and lips reversal of hot and cold sensation ataxia vertigo and hallucinations Severe cases of ciguatera can also result in cold allodynia which is a burning sensation on contact with cold Neurological symptoms can persist and ciguatera poisoning is occasionally misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis Cardiovascular symptoms include bradycardia tachycardia hypotension hypertension orthostatic tachycardia exercise intolerance and rhythm disorders Death from the condition can occur but is very rare Dyspareunia and other ciguatera symptoms have developed in otherwise healthy males and females following sexual intercourse with partners suffering ciguatera poisoning signifying that the toxin may be sexually transmitted Diarrhea and facial rashes have been reported in breastfed infants of poisoned mothers suggesting that ciguatera toxins migrate into breast milk The symptoms can last from weeks to years and in extreme cases as long as 20 years often leading to long term disability Most people do recover slowly over time
Claustrophobia is classified as a mental and behavioral disorder specifically an anxiety disorder Symptoms generally develop during childhood or adolescence Claustrophobia is typically thought to have one key symptom fear of suffocation In at least one if not several of the following areas small rooms MRI or CAT scan apparatus cars buses airplanes trains tunnels underwater caves cellars elevators and caves Being enclosed or thinking about being enclosed in a confined space can trigger fears of not being able to breathe properly and running out of oxygen It is not always the small space that triggers these emotions but it is more the fear of the possibilities of what could happen while confined to that area When anxiety levels start to reach a certain ppo level the person may start to experience
There are many different signs and symptoms for thyroiditis none of which are exclusively limited to this disease Many of the signs imitate symptoms of other diseases so thyroiditis can sometimes be difficult to diagnose Common hypothyroid symptoms manifest when thyroid cell damage is slow and chronic and may include fatigue weight gain feeling fuzzy headed depression dry skin and constipation Other rarer symptoms include swelling of the legs vague aches and pains decreased concentration and so on When conditions become more severe depending on the type of thyroiditis one may start to see puffiness around the eyes slowing of the heart rate a drop in body temperature or even incipient heart failure On the other hand if the thyroid cell damage is acute the thyroid hormone within the gland leaks out into the bloodstream causing symptoms of thyrotoxicosis which is similar to those of hyperthyroidism These symptoms include weight loss irritability anxiety insomnia fast heart rate and fatigue Elevated levels of thyroid hormone in the bloodstream cause both conditions but thyrotoxicosis is the term used with thyroiditis since the thyroid gland is not overactive as in the case of hyperthyroidism
About 80 of those infected with West Nile virus WNV show no symptoms and go unreported About 20 of infected people develop symptoms These vary in severity and begin 3 to 14 days after being bitten Most people with mild symptoms of WNV recover completely though fatigue and weakness may last for weeks or months Symptoms may range from mild such as fever to severe such as paralysis and meningitis A severe infection can last weeks and can rarely cause permanent brain damage Death may ensue if the central nervous system is affected Medical conditions such as cancer and diabetes and age over 60 years increase the risk of developing severe symptoms Headache can be a prominent symptom of WNV fever meningitis encephalitis meningoencephalitis and it may or may not be present in poliomyelitis like syndrome Thus headache is not a useful indicator of neuroinvasive disease
The main symptom is persistent non bloody watery diarrhea which may be profuse People may also experience abdominal pain fecal incontinence and unintentional weight loss Microscopic colitis is the diagnosis in around 10 of cases investigated for chronic non bloody diarrhea
Signs and symptoms presented by the occurrence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy are the result of the heart failing and usually occur after the disease has progressed to an advanced stage Therefore the symptoms have a lot in common with other forms of cardiomyopathy These symptoms can include the following Ankle feet and leg swelling edema Overall swelling Loss of appetite Shortness of breath dyspnea especially with activity Breathing difficulty while lying down Fatigue weakness faintness Decreased alertness or concentration Cough containing mucus or pink frothy material Decreased urine output oliguria Need to urinate at night nocturia Heart palpitations irregular heart beat Rapid pulse tachycardia
Onset may be rapid acute or more gradual subacute Signs of cardiac tamponade typically include those of cardiogenic shock including shortness of breath weakness lightheadedness cough and those of Becks triad e g jugular vein distention quiet heart sounds and hypotension Other symptoms may relate to the underlying cause Other general signs of shock such as fast heart rate shortness of breath and decreasing level of consciousness may also occur However some of these signs may not be present in certain cases A fast heart rate although expected may be absent in people with uremia and hypothyroidism According to Reddy cardiac tamponade and its progression can be described in 3 different phases In phase I the required filling pressure increases due to the high stiffness of the ventricles This is because of the accumulation of pericardial fluid in the pericardial cavity During phase II the pericardial pressure exceeds the ventricular filling pressure caused by the further accumulation of pericardial fluid This results in a decrease in cardiac input and output A further decrease of cardiac input and output is typical in phase III of the progression of cardiac tamponade This is caused by the equilibration of left ventricular filling and pericardial pressure leading to severe deterioration of end organ perfusion Some of the symptoms as a consequence include abdominal pain due to liver engorgement
The principal manifestation of lactose intolerance is an adverse reaction to products containing lactose primarily milk including abdominal bloating and cramps flatulence diarrhea nausea borborygmi and vomiting particularly in adolescents These appear one half to two hours after consumption The severity of these signs and symptoms typically increases with the amount of lactose consumed most lactose intolerant people can tolerate a certain level of lactose in their diets without ill effects Because lactose intolerance is not an allergy it does not produce allergy symptoms such as itching hives or anaphylaxis
Interstitial nephritis may present with a variety of signs and symptoms many of these nonspecific Fever is the most common occurring in 30 50 of patients particularly those with drug induced interstitial nephritis Other general symptoms that occur with variable frequency include nausea vomiting fatigue lack of appetite and weight loss More specific symptoms such as flank pain pain with urination and visible blood in the urine as well as signs like hypertension can be helpful in increasing suspicion for the diagnosis The classic triad of symptoms reported in early documented cases consisted of rash joint pain and increased eosinophils in the blood however more recent epidemiology suggests that this grouping of symptoms only occurs in a small minority 5 10 of patients With modern drugs causing between 70 and 90 of current cases the possibility of a change in presentation exists
Some patients have limited awareness of their dysphagia so lack of the symptom does not exclude an underlying disease When dysphagia goes undiagnosed or untreated patients are at a high risk of pulmonary aspiration and subsequent aspiration pneumonia secondary to food or liquids going the wrong way into the lungs Some people present with silent aspiration and do not cough or show outward signs of aspiration Undiagnosed dysphagia can also result in dehydration malnutrition and kidney failure Some signs and symptoms of oropharyngeal dysphagia include difficulty controlling food in the mouth inability to control food or saliva in the mouth difficulty initiating a swallow coughing choking frequent pneumonia unexplained weight loss gurgly or wet voice after swallowing nasal regurgitation and patient complaint of swallowing difficulty When asked where the food is getting stuck patients will often point to the cervical neck region as the site of the obstruction The actual site of obstruction is always at or below the level at which the level of obstruction is perceived The most common symptom of esophageal dysphagia is the inability to swallow solid food which the patient will describe as becoming stuck or held up before it either passes into the stomach or is regurgitated Pain on swallowing or odynophagia is a distinctive symptom that can be highly indicative of carcinoma although it also has numerous other causes that are not related to cancer Achalasia is a major exception to usual pattern of dysphagia in that swallowing of fluid tends to cause more difficulty than swallowing solids In achalasia there is idiopathic destruction of parasympathetic ganglia of the Auerbachs Myenteric plexus of the entire esophagus which results in functional narrowing of the lower esophagus and peristaltic failure throughout its length
Nephroptosis is asymptomatic in most persons However nephroptosis can be characterized by violent attacks of colicky flank pain nausea chills hypertension hematuria and proteinuria Persons with symptomatic nephroptosis often complain of sharp pains that radiate into the groin Many persons also suggest a weighing feeling on the abdomen Pain is typically relieved by lying down It is believed that flank pain on standing that is relieved by lying down is due to movement of the kidney causing intermittent renal tract obstruction The attack of colic pain is called Dietls crisis or renal paroxysm
SJS usually begins with fever sore throat and fatigue which is commonly misdiagnosed and therefore treated with antibiotics SJS SJS TEN and TEN are often heralded by fever sore throat cough and burning eyes for 1 to 3 days Patients with these disorders frequently experience burning pain of their skin at the start of disease Ulcers and other lesions begin to appear in the mucous membranes almost always in the mouth and lips but also in the genital and anal regions Those in the mouth are usually extremely painful and reduce the patients ability to eat or drink Conjunctivitis occurs in about 30 of children who develop SJS A rash of round lesions about an inch across arises on the face trunk arms and legs and soles of the feet but usually not the scalp
Disease manifestations Regarding the age of diagnosis this differs according to the intensity of the symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to florid symptoms characterized by ocular and systemic diseases affecting multiple organs that have in common their origin in the neural crest Eye manifestations Bilateral ocular manifestations are usually pathognomonic of the disease In the case of children who develop glaucoma they may attend the consultation with signs and symptoms of buphthalmos photosensitivity tearing corneal decompensation which associated with poor vision can be completed with a strabismus In the case of the adult there is a greater chance of not presenting symptoms so an ophthalmological control may be required to detect the problem Using a slit lamp a posterior embryotoxon characterized by a prominent anteriorly displaced Schwalbes ring near the temporal corneal limbus can be revealed The unexpected finding of a posterior embryotoxon as a single whitish irregular arcuate ridge on routine examination is not necessarily a diagnosis of ARS as this occurs in a percentage estimated in the literature from 8 to 15 of the normal population In the case of gonioscopy we can observe that the extension of the posterior embryotoxon can be greater and be present in the 360 with a variable thickness of the annulus and unusually detached and hanging within the anterior chamber Regarding the iris we can observe peripheral extensions to Schwalbes line which can be thin or thick and extend over the trabecular meshwork obscuring the scleral spur and even pulling the iris and producing corectopia in iris tissue that can range from atrophy mild stromal to the presence of uveal ectropion pseudopolycoria or even absence of iris These chamber sinus anomalies predispose half of the cases to open angle glaucoma which can manifest throughout life and therefore require regular ophthalmological check ups Other related anomalies are strabismus due to alteration in the insertions of the extraocular muscles or secondary to amblyopia and with a predisposition to exotropia and retinal detachment Systemic manifestations In the case of pathologies that affect the extraocular organs greater attention must be paid to anomalies in the cardiovascular system since they represent the most worrying associations due to their repercussions at the systemic level These are present in different structures that make it up such as heart valve defects the presence of Fallots tetralogy atrial septal defects or persistent truncus arteriosus Other alterations described are craniofacial anomalies associated with hypoplasia of the midface hypertelorism telecanthus maxillary hypoplasia short nasolabial fold thin upper lip and larger everted lower lip which are typical facial characteristics although expressed in a variable way Maxillary hypoplasia and poor tooth development produce a prognathic profile Inspection of the oral cavity may show microdontia hypodontia oligodontia and a thickened frenulum The crowns of the anterior teeth may be conical or peg shaped and the roots may be shortened the gingival attachments may be reduced and the enamel may be hypoplastic contributing to poor dental health There are other described associations such as umbilical auditory pituitary psychomotor size urethral and anal anomalies as well as albinism
The initial scratch or wound caused by a bite from a carrier rodent results in mild inflammatory reactions and ulcerations The wounds may heal initially but reappear with the onset of symptoms The symptoms include recurring fever with body temperature 101 104 F 38 40 C The fever lasts for 2 4 days but recurs generally at 4 8 weeks This cycle may continue for months or years The other symptoms include regional lymphadenitis malaise and headache The complications include myocarditis endocarditis hepatitis splenomegaly and meningitis
The onset of this disease is usually noticed in childhood but often not diagnosed until the third or fourth decade of life Symptoms include exercise intolerance with muscle pain early fatigue painful cramps inappropriate rapid heart rate response to exercise and may include myoglobin in the urine often provoked by a bout of exercise In McArdles our heart rate tends to increase in what is called an inappropriate response That is after the start of exercise it increases much more quickly than would be expected in someone unaffected by McArdles Myoglobinuria may be seen due to the breakdown of skeletal muscle known as rhabdomyolysis a condition in which muscle cells breakdown sending their contents into the bloodstream In a recent study of 269 GSD V patients 39 4 reported no previous episodes of myoglobinuria and 6 8 had normal CK even with fixed muscle weakness so an absence of myoglobinuria and normal CK should not rule out the possibility of the disease As skeletal muscle relies predominantly on glycogenolysis for the first few minutes as it transitions from rest to activity as well as throughout high intensity aerobic activity and all anaerobic activity individuals with GSD V experience during exercise sinus tachycardia tachypnea muscle fatigue and pain during the aforementioned activities and time frames Patients may exhibit a second wind phenomenon This is characterized by the patients better tolerance for aerobic exercise such as walking and cycling after approximately 10 minutes This is attributed to the combination of increased blood flow and the ability of the body to find alternative sources of energy like fatty acids and proteins In the long term patients may exhibit kidney failure due to the myoglobinuria and with age patients may exhibit progressively increasing weakness and substantial muscle loss Younger people may display unusual symptoms such as difficulty in chewing swallowing or utilizing normal oral motor functions A number of comorbidities were found in GSD V patients at a higher rate than found in the general population including but not limited to hypertension 17 endocrine diseases 15 7 muskuloskeletal rheumatic disease 12 9 hyperuricemia gout 11 6 gastrointestinal diseases 11 2 neurological disease 10 respiratory disease 9 5 and coronary artery disease 8 3 Patients may have hypertrophy particularly of the legs and may have lower bone mineral content and density in the legs GSD V patients may experience myogenic hyperuricemia exercise induced accelerated breakdown of purine nucleotides in skeletal muscle The Purine Nucleotide Cycle PNC is activated when the ATP energy reservoir in muscle cells runs low and is a part of Protein Metabolism Adenine a purine is converted into AMP adenosine monophosphate IMP inosine monophosphate and S AMP adenylosuccinate in a circular fashion the byproducts are fumarate which goes on to produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation ammonia from the conversion of AMP into IMP and uric acid from excess IMP To avoid health complications GSD V patients need to get their ATP energy primarily from Free Fatty Acids Lipid Metabolism rather than Protein Metabolism Over reliance on protein metabolism can be best avoided by not depleting the ATP reservoir such as by not pushing through the pain and by not going too fast too soon Be wary of pushing on when you feel pain start This pain is a result of damaging muscles and repeated damage will cause problems in the long term But also this is counterproductive it will stop you from getting into second wind By pressing on despite the pain you start your protein metabolism which then effectively blocks your glucose and fat metabolism If you ever get into this situation you need to stop completely for 30 minutes or more and then start the whole process again Patients may present at emergency rooms with severe fixed contractures of the muscles and often severe pain These require urgent assessment for rhabdomyolysis as in about 30 of cases this leads to acute kidney injury Left untreated this can be life threatening In a small number of cases compartment syndrome has developed requiring prompt surgical referral
Benign tumors are very diverse they may be asymptomatic or may cause specific symptoms depending on their anatomic location and tissue type They grow outward producing large rounded masses which can cause what is known as a mass effect This growth can cause compression of local tissues or organs leading to many effects such as blockage of ducts reduced blood flow ischaemia tissue death necrosis and nerve pain or damage Some tumors also produce hormones that can lead to life threatening situations Insulinomas can produce large amounts of insulin causing hypoglycemia Pituitary adenomas can cause elevated levels of hormones such as growth hormone and insulin like growth factor 1 which cause acromegaly prolactin ACTH and cortisol which cause Cushings disease TSH which causes hyperthyroidism and FSH and LH Bowel intussusception can occur with various benign colonic tumors Cosmetic effects can be caused by tumors especially those of the skin possibly causing psychological or social discomfort for the person with the tumor Vascular tissue tumors can bleed in some cases leading to anemia
Complete motor paralysis below the level of the lesion due to interruption of the corticospinal tract Loss of pain and temperature sensation at and below the level of the lesion due to interruption of the spinothalamic tract Retained proprioception and vibratory sensation due to intact dorsal columns Autonomic dysfunction may be present and can manifest as hypotension either orthostatic or frank hypotension sexual dysfunction and or bowel and bladder dysfunction Areflexia flaccid internal and external anal sphincter urinary retention and intestinal obstruction may also be present in individuals with anterior cord syndrome Symptoms usually occur very quickly and are often experienced within one hour of the initial damage MRI can detect the magnitude and location of the damage 10 15 hours after the initiation of symptoms Diffusion weighted imaging may be used as it is able to identify the damage within a few minutes of symptomatic onset Clinical features include paraparesis or quadriparesis depending on the level of the injury and impaired pain and temperature sensation Complete motor paralysis below the level of the lesion due to interruption of the corticospinal tract and loss of pain and temperature sensation at and below the level of the lesion Proprioception and vibratory sensation is preserved as it is in the dorsal side of the spinal cord
Overview The disease is characterised by bilateral diffuse uveitis with pain redness and blurring of vision The eye symptoms may be accompanied by a varying constellation of systemic symptoms such as auditory tinnitus vertigo and hypoacusis neurological meningismus with malaise fever headache nausea abdominal pain stiffness of the neck and back or a combination of these factors meningitis CSF pleocytosis cranial nerve palsies hemiparesis transverse myelitis and ciliary ganglionitis and cutaneous manifestations including poliosis vitiligo and alopecia The vitiligo often is found at the sacral region
Congestive heart failure is a pathophysiological condition in which the hearts output is insufficient to meet the needs of the body and lungs The term congestive heart failure is often used because one of the most common symptoms is congestion or fluid accumulation in the tissues and veins of the lungs or other parts of a persons body Congestion manifests itself particularly in the form of fluid accumulation and swelling edema both in the form of peripheral edema causing swollen limbs and feet and pulmonary edema causing difficulty breathing and ascites swollen abdomen Symptoms of heart failure are traditionally divided into left sided and right sided because the left and right ventricles supply different parts of the circulation but sufferers often have both types of signs and symptoms In biventricular heart failure both sides of the heart are affected Left sided heart failure is the more common
Symptoms of PDD may include behavioral and communication problems such as
The hallmark of polymyositis is weakness and or loss of muscle mass in the proximal musculature as well as flexion of the neck and torso These symptoms can be associated with marked pain in these areas as well The hip extensors are often severely affected leading to particular difficulty in climbing stairs and rising from a seated position The skin involvement of dermatomyositis is absent in polymyositis Dysphagia difficulty swallowing or other problems with esophageal motility occur in as many as 1 3 of patients Low grade fever and enlarged lymph nodes may be present Foot drop in one or both feet can be a symptom of advanced polymyositis and inclusion body myositis The systemic involvement of polymyositis includes interstitial lung disease ILD and heart disease such as heart failure and conduction abnormalities Polymyositis tends to become evident in adulthood presenting with bilateral proximal muscle weakness often noted in the upper legs due to early fatigue while walking Sometimes the weakness presents itself as an inability to rise from a seated position without help or an inability to raise ones arms above ones head The weakness is generally progressive accompanied by lymphocytic inflammation mainly cytotoxic T cells
Light infestations 100 worms frequently have no symptoms Heavier infestations especially in small children can present gastrointestinal problems including abdominal pain and distension bloody or mucus filled diarrhea and tenesmus feeling of incomplete defecation generally accompanied by involuntary straining Mechanical damage to the intestinal mucosa may occur as well as toxic or inflammatory damage to the intestines of the host While appendicitis may be brought on by damage and edema of the adjacent tissue if there are large numbers of worms or larvae present it has been suggested that the embedding of the worms into the ileocecal region may also make the host susceptible to bacterial infection A severe infection with high numbers of embedded worms in the rectum leads to edema which can cause rectal prolapse although this is typically only seen in small children The prolapsed inflamed and edematous rectal tissue may even show visible worms Physical growth delay weight loss nutritional deficiencies and anemia due to long standing blood loss are also characteristic of infection and these symptoms are more prevalent and severe in children It does not commonly cause eosinophilia Coinfection of T trichiura with other parasites is common and with larger worm burdens can cause both exacerbation of dangerous trichuriasis symptoms such as massive gastrointestinal bleeding shown to be especially dramatic with coinfection with Salmonella typhi and exacerbation of symptoms and pathogenesis of the other parasitic infection as is typical with coinfection with Schistosoma mansoni in which higher worm burden and liver egg burden is common Parasitic coinfection with HIV AIDS tuberculosis and malaria is also common especially in sub Saharan Africa and helminth coinfection adversely affects the natural history and progression of HIV AIDS tuberculosis and malaria and can increase clinical malaria severity In a study performed in Senegal infections of soil transmitted helminths like T trichiura as well as schistosome infections independently showed enhanced risk and increased the incidence of malaria Heavy infestations may have bloody diarrhea Long standing blood loss may lead to iron deficiency anemia Vitamin A deficiency may also result due to infection
Women with the condition may be asymptomatic and unaware of having a unicornuate uterus normal pregnancy may occur In a review of the literature Reichman et al analyzed the data on pregnancy outcome of 290 women with a unicornuate uterus 175 women had conceived for a total of 468 pregnancies They found that about 50 of patients delivered a live baby The rates for ectopic pregnancy was 2 7 for miscarriage 34 and for preterm delivery 20 while the intrauterine demise rate was 10 Thus patients with a unicornuate uterus are at a higher risk for pregnancy loss and obstetrical complications
Repeated periodic joint effusions of the knee Usually one knee is affected but sometimes both knees Other joints may also be involved along with the knee Effusions are large restricting range of motion but significant pain is not a feature There is usually stiffness Tenderness of the joint may or may not be present Aspirated synovial fluid is usually sterile but will sometimes show elevated cell count 100 cells mL with 50 being polymorphonuclear leukocytes Onset of effusions are sudden with no particular trigger or stimulus Each episode lasts for a few days to about a week and recurs in cycles of 7 to 11 days with extremes of 3 days to 30 days also reported Sometimes the joint may begin to swell again as soon as the fluid has subsided Where both knees are affected concurrently as one joint ceases to swell the other may become involved The cycle of joints swellings have been reported as being very regular even predictable This has been a characteristic feature of IH in many case reports However over the longer term especially these cycles of effusion and recovery may not be as constant as first reported In women many cases seem to begin at puberty Episodes of knee swelling may coincide the menstrual cycle In nearly all case reports pregnancy seems to suppress the condition but after birth during lactation it returns In the main patients are mostly free of other symptoms Fever is rare There no signs of local inflammation or lymphatic involvement Laboratory tests are generally normal or within reference limits
Anemia is considered to be the most common blood disorder A person with anemia may not have any symptoms depending on the underlying cause and no symptoms may be noticed as the anemia is initially mild and then the symptoms become worse as the anemia worsens A patient with anemia may report feeling tired weak decreased ability to concentrate and sometimes shortness of breath on exertion Symptoms of anemia can come on quickly or slowly Early on there may be few or no symptoms If the anemia continues slowly chronic the body may adapt and compensate for this change In this case no symptoms may appear until the anemia becomes more severe Symptoms can include feeling tired weak dizziness headaches lack of physical exertion shortness of breath difficulty concentrating irregular or rapid heartbeat cold hands and feet cold intolerance pale or yellow skin poor appetite easy bruising and bleeding and muscle weakness Anemia that develops quickly often has more severe symptoms including feeling faint chest pain sweating increased thirst and confusion There may be also additional symptoms depending on the underlying cause In more severe anemia the body may compensate for the lack of oxygen carrying capability of the blood by increasing cardiac output The person may have symptoms related to this such as palpitations angina if pre existing heart disease is present intermittent claudication of the legs and symptoms of heart failure On examination the signs exhibited may include pallor pale skin mucosa conjunctiva and nail beds but this is not a reliable sign A blue coloration of the sclera may be noticed in some cases of iron deficiency anemia There may be signs of specific causes of anemia e g koilonychia in iron deficiency jaundice when anemia results from abnormal break down of red blood cells in hemolytic anemia nerve cell damage vitamin B12 deficiency bone deformities found in thalassemia major or leg ulcers seen in sickle cell disease In severe anemia there may be signs of a hyperdynamic circulation tachycardia a fast heart rate bounding pulse flow murmurs and cardiac ventricular hypertrophy enlargement There may be signs of heart failure Pica the consumption of non food items such as ice paper wax grass hair or dirt may be a symptom of iron deficiency although it occurs often in those who have normal levels of hemoglobin Chronic anemia may result in behavioral disturbances in children as a direct result of impaired neurological development in infants and reduced academic performance in children of school age Restless legs syndrome is more common in people with iron deficiency anemia than in the general population
Symptoms are variable ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness They depend on the type of adenovirus where it enters into the body and on the age and well being of the person Recognised patterns of clinical features include respiratory eye gastrointestinal genitourinary and central nervous system There is also a widespread type that occurs in immunocompromised people Typical symptoms are of a mild cold or resembling the flu fever nasal congestion coryza cough and pinky red eyes Infants may also have symptoms of an ear infection Onset is usually two to fourteen days after exposure to the virus There may be tiredness chills muscle aches or headache However some people have no symptoms Generally a day or two after developing a sore throat with large tonsils glands can be felt in the neck Illness is more likely to be severe in people with weakened immune systems particularly children who have had a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Sometimes there is a skin rash
The determination of Braxton Hicks contractions is dependent on the history and physical assessment of the pregnant womans abdomen as there are no specific imaging tests for diagnosis The key is to differentiate Braxton Hicks contractions from true labor contractions see Table 1 above Most commonly Braxton Hicks contractions are weak and feel like mild cramping that occurs in a localized area in the front abdomen at an infrequent and irregular rhythm usually every 10 20 minutes with each contraction lasting up to 2 minutes They may be associated with certain triggers and can disappear and reappear they do not get more frequent longer or stronger over the course of the contractions However as the end of a pregnancy approaches Braxton Hicks contractions tend to become more frequent and more intense On a physical exam some uterine muscle tightening may be palpable but there should be no palpable contraction in the uterine fundus and no cervical changes or cervical dilation Braxton Hicks contractions do not lead to birth More concerning symptoms that may require assessment by a healthcare professional include Any bleeding or fluid leakage from the vagina Contractions that are strong frequent every 5 minutes and persisting for an hour Changes or significant decreases in fetal movement
Tinnitus may be perceived in one or both ears or more centrally in the head The noise commonly occurs inside a persons head or ear s in the absence of auditory stimulation similar to ringing although in some people it is a high pitched whining or electric buzzing among numerous other sounds Tinnitus may be intermittent or continuous In some individuals the intensity may be changed by shoulder neck head tongue jaw or eye movements The specific type of tinnitus called objective tinnitus is characterized by hearing the sounds of ones own muscle contractions or pulse which is typically a result of sounds that have been created by the movement of jaw muscles or sounds related to blood flow in the neck or face
The presentation is the following Anxiety restlessness altered mental state due to decreased blood flow to the brain and subsequent hypoxia Low blood pressure due to decrease in cardiac output A rapid weak thready pulse due to decreased circulation combined with tachycardia Cool clammy and mottled skin cutis marmorata due to vasoconstriction and subsequent hypoperfusion of the skin Distended jugular veins due to increased jugular venous pressure Oliguria low urine output due to inadequate blood flow to the kidneys if the condition persists Rapid and deeper respirations hyperventilation due to sympathetic nervous system stimulation and acidosis Fatigue due to hyperventilation and hypoxia Absent pulse in fast and abnormal heart rhythms Pulmonary edema involving fluid back up in the lungs due to insufficient pumping of the heart
Inattention hyperactivity restlessness in adults disruptive behavior and impulsivity are common in ADHD Academic difficulties are frequent as are problems with relationships The symptoms can be difficult to define as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of inattention hyperactivity and impulsivity end and significant levels requiring interventions begin According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM 5 and its text revision DSM 5 TR symptoms must be present for six months or more to a degree that is much greater than others of the same age This requires at least six symptoms of either inattention or hyperactivity impulsivity for those under 17 and at least five symptoms for those 17 years or older The symptoms must be present in at least two settings e g social school work or home and must directly interfere with or reduce quality of functioning Additionally several symptoms must have been present before age twelve
Patients with GRA may be asymptomatic but the following symptoms can be present Fatigue Headache High blood pressure Hypokalemia Intermittent or temporary paralysis Muscle spasms Muscle weakness Numbness Polyuria Polydipsia Tingling Hypernatraemia Metabolic alkalosis
The neuromuscular symptoms of hypercalcaemia are caused by a negative bathmotropic effect due to the increased interaction of calcium with sodium channels Since calcium blocks sodium channels and inhibits depolarization of nerve and muscle fibers increased calcium raises the threshold for depolarization This results in diminished deep tendon reflexes hyporeflexia and skeletal muscle weakness Other symptoms include cardiac arrhythmias especially in those taking digoxin fatigue nausea vomiting emesis loss of appetite abdominal pain paralytic ileus If kidney impairment occurs as a result manifestations can include increased urination urination at night and increased thirst Psychiatric manifestation can include emotional instability confusion delirium psychosis and stupor Calcium deposits known as limbus sign may be visible in the eyes Symptoms are more common at high calcium blood values 12 0 mg dL or 3 mmol L Severe hypercalcaemia above 15 16 mg dL or 3 75 4 mmol L is considered a medical emergency at these levels coma and cardiac arrest can result The high levels of calcium ions decrease the neuron membrane permeability to sodium ions thus decreasing excitability which leads to hypotonicity of smooth and striated muscle This explains the fatigue muscle weakness low tone and sluggish reflexes in muscle groups The sluggish nerves also explain drowsiness confusion hallucinations stupor or coma In the gut this causes constipation Hypocalcaemia causes the opposite by the same mechanism
A characteristic feature of isovaleric acidemia is a distinctive odor of sweaty feet This odor is caused by the buildup of a compound called isovaleric acid in affected individuals In about half of cases the signs and symptoms of this disorder become apparent within a few days after birth and include poor feeding vomiting seizures and lack of energy that can progress to coma These medical problems are typically severe and can be life threatening In the other half of cases the signs and symptoms of the disorder appear during childhood and may come and go over time They are often triggered by an infection or by eating an increased amount of protein rich foods
The tsetse fly bite erupts into a red chancre sore and within a few weeks the person can experience fever swollen lymph glands blood in urine aching muscles and joints headaches and irritability In the first phase the patient has only intermittent bouts of fever with lymphadenopathy together with other non specific signs and symptoms The second stage of the disease is marked by involvement of the central nervous system with extensive neurological effects like changes in personality alteration of the biological clock the circadian rhythm confusion slurred speech seizures and difficulty in walking and talking These problems can develop over many years and if not treated the person dies It is common in Subsaharan Africa
Malunions are presented by excessive swelling twisting bending and possibly shortening of the bone Patients may have trouble placing weight on or near the malunion
Swelling appears after 2 3 days after birth If severe the child may develop jaundice anemia or hypotension In some cases it may be an indication of a linear skull fracture or be at risk of an infection leading to osteomyelitis or meningitis The swelling of a cephalohematoma takes weeks to resolve as the blood clot is slowly absorbed from the periphery towards the centre In time the swelling hardens calcification leaving a relatively softer centre so that it appears as a depressed fracture Cephalohematoma should be distinguished from another scalp bleeding called subgaleal hemorrhage also called subaponeurotic hemorrhage which is blood between the scalp and skull bone above the periosteum and is more extensive It is more prone to complications especially anemia and bruising
Retrograde ejaculation is sometimes referred to as a dry orgasm Retrograde ejaculation is one symptom of male infertility A man may notice during masturbation that despite the occurrence of orgasm no accompanying ejaculation was produced Another underlying cause for this phenomenon may be ejaculatory duct obstruction During a male orgasm sperm are released from the epididymis and travel via small tubes called the vas deferens The sperm mix with seminal fluid in the seminal vesicles prostate fluid from the prostate gland and lubricants from the bulbourethral gland During climax muscles at the end of the bladder neck tighten to prevent retrograde flow of semen In retrograde ejaculation these bladder neck muscles are either very weak or the nerves controlling the muscles have been damaged
The symptoms of melasma are dark irregular well demarcated hyperpigmented macules to patches These patches often develop gradually over time Melasma does not cause any other symptoms beyond the cosmetic discoloration Patches can vary in size from 0 5 cm to larger than 10 cm depending on the person Its location can be categorized as centrofacial malar or mandibular The most common is centrofacial in which patches appear on the cheeks nose upper lip forehead and chin The mandibular category accounts for patches on the bilateral rami while the malar location accounts for patches only on the nose and cheeks
Pneumocystosis is generally an infection in the lungs Involvement outside the lungs is rare but can occur as a disseminated type affecting lymph nodes bone marrow liver or spleen It may also affect skin eyes kidneys thyroid heart adrenals and gastrointestinal tract
The classic manifestation of bladder exstrophy presents with A defect in the abdominal wall occupied by both the exstrophied bladder as well as a portion of the urethra A flattened puborectal sling Separation of the pubic symphysis Shortening of a pubic rami External rotation of the pelvis Females frequently have a displaced and narrowed vaginal orifice a bifid clitoris and divergent labia
Chest pain that may or may not radiate to other parts of the body is the most typical and significant symptom of myocardial infarction It might be accompanied by other symptoms such as sweating
There are often no symptoms associated with a urethrocele When present symptoms include stress incontinence increased urinary frequency and urinary retention difficulty in emptying the bladder Pain during sexual intercourse may also occur
EoE often presents with difficulty swallowing food impaction stomach pains regurgitation or vomiting and decreased appetite Although the typical onset of EoE is in childhood the disease can be found in all age groups and symptoms vary depending on the age of presentation In addition young children with EoE may present with feeding difficulties and poor weight gain It is more common in males and affects both adults and children Predominant symptoms in school aged children and adolescents include difficulty swallowing food impaction and choking gagging with meals particularly when eating foods with coarse textures Other symptoms in this age group can include abdominal chest pain vomiting and regurgitation The predominant symptom in adults is difficulty swallowing however intractable heartburn and food avoidance may also be present Due to the long standing inflammation and possible resultant scarring that may have gone unrecognized adults presenting with EoE tend to have more episodes of esophageal food impaction as well as other esophageal abnormalities such as Schatzki ring esophageal webs and in some cases achalasia Although many of these symptoms overlap with the symptoms of GERD the majority of patients with EoE exhibit a poor response to acid suppression therapy Many people with EoE have other autoimmune and allergic diseases such as asthma and celiac disease Mast cell disorders such as Mast Cell Activation Syndrome or Mastocytosis are also frequently associated with it
The characteristics of a burn depend upon its depth Superficial burns cause pain lasting two or three days followed by peeling of the skin over the next few days Individuals with more severe burns may indicate discomfort or complain of feeling pressure rather than pain Full thickness burns may be entirely insensitive to light touch or puncture While superficial burns are typically red in color severe burns may be pink white or black Burns around the mouth or singed hair inside the nose may indicate that burns to the airways have occurred but these findings are not definitive More worrisome signs include shortness of breath hoarseness and stridor or wheezing Itchiness is common during the healing process occurring in up to 90 of adults and nearly all children Numbness or tingling may persist for a prolonged period of time after an electrical injury Burns may also produce emotional and psychological distress
The symptoms signs of pulmonary heart disease cor pulmonale can be non specific and depend on the stage of the disorder and can include blood backing up into the systemic venous system including the hepatic vein As pulmonary heart disease progresses most individuals will develop symptoms like Shortness of breath Wheezing Cyanosis Ascites Jaundice Enlargement of the liver Raised jugular venous pressure JVP Third heart sound Intercostal recession Presence of abnormal heart sounds
A myopic individual can see clearly out to a certain distance the far point of the eye but objects placed beyond this distance appear blurred If the extent of the myopia is great enough even standard reading distances can be affected Upon routine examination of the eyes the vast majority of myopic eyes appear structurally identical to nonmyopic eyes Onset is often in school children with worsening between the ages of 8 and 15
Rotavirus gastroenteritis is a mild to severe disease characterised by vomiting watery diarrhoea and low grade fever Once a child is infected by the virus there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by profuse diarrhoea after at least four days Dehydration is more common in rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens and is the most common cause of death related to rotavirus infection Rotavirus A infections can occur throughout life the first usually produces symptoms but subsequent infections are typically mild or asymptomatic as the immune system provides some protection 106 124 Consequently symptomatic infection rates are highest in children under two years of age and decrease progressively towards 45 years of age Infection in newborn children although common is often associated with mild or asymptomatic disease the most severe symptoms tend to occur in children six months to two years of age the elderly and those with compromised or absent immune system functions Due to immunity acquired in childhood most adults are not susceptible to rotavirus gastroenteritis in adults usually has a cause other than rotavirus but asymptomatic infections in adults may maintain the transmission of infection in the community
Gout can present in several ways although the most common is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis a red tender hot swollen joint The metatarsal phalangeal joint at the base of the big toe is affected most often accounting for half of cases Other joints such as the heels knees wrists and fingers may also be affected Joint pain usually begins during the night and peaks within 24 hours of onset This is mainly due to lower body temperature Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the joint pain including fatigue and a high fever Long standing elevated uric acid levels hyperuricemia may result in other symptoms including hard painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion Elevated levels of uric acid may also lead to crystals precipitating in the kidneys resulting in stone formation and subsequent urate nephropathy
The term cardiac arrhythmia covers a very large number of very different conditions The most common symptom of arrhythmia is an awareness of an abnormal heartbeat called palpitations These may be infrequent frequent or continuous Some of these arrhythmias are harmless though distracting for patients but some of them predispose to adverse outcomes Some arrhythmias do not cause symptoms and are not associated with increased mortality However some asymptomatic arrhythmias are associated with adverse events Examples include a higher risk of blood clotting within the heart and a higher risk of insufficient blood being transported to the heart because of a weak heartbeat Other increased risks are of embolization and stroke heart failure and sudden cardiac death If an arrhythmia results in a heartbeat that is too fast too slow or too weak to supply the bodys needs this manifests as lower blood pressure and may cause lightheadedness dizziness syncope or brain death due to insufficient supply of blood to the brain Some types of arrhythmia result in cardiac arrest or sudden death Medical assessment of the abnormality using an electrocardiogram is one way to diagnose and assess the risk of any given arrhythmia
Epilepsy is characterized by a long term risk of recurrent epileptic seizures These seizures may present in several ways depending on the parts of the brain involved and the persons age
The symptoms vary and progress with age and are characterized by a triad of seizures cognitive dysfunction and EEG findings The triad may not fully emerge until 1 2 years after first seizure episode
In women high blood levels of prolactin are typically associated with hypoestrogenism anovulatory infertility and changes in menstruation Menstruation disturbances experienced in women commonly manifests as amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea In the latter case irregular menstrual flow may result in abnormally heavy and prolonged bleeding menorrhagia Women who are not pregnant or nursing may also unexpectedly begin producing breast milk galactorrhea a condition that is not always associated with high prolactin levels For instance many premenopausal women experiencing hyperprolactinemia do not experience galactorrhea and only some women who experience galactorrhea will be diagnosed with hyperprolactinemia Thus galactorrhea may be observed in individuals with normal prolactin levels and does not necessarily indicate hyperprolactinemia This phenomenon is likely due to galactorrhea requiring adequate levels of progesterone or estrogen to prepare the breast tissue Additionally some women may also experience loss of libido and breast pain particularly when prolactin levels rise initially as the hormone promotes tissue changes in the breast In men the most common symptoms of hyperprolactinemia are decreased libido sexual dysfunction erectile dysfunction impotence infertility and gynecomastia Unlike women men do not experience reliable indicators of elevated prolactin such as menstruation to prompt immediate medical consultation As a result the early signs of hyperprolactinemia are generally more difficult to detect and may go unnoticed until more severe symptoms are present For instance symptoms such as loss of libido and sexual dysfunction are subtle arise gradually and may falsely indicate a differential cause Many men with pituitary tumor associated hyperprolactinemia may forego clinical help until they begin to experience serious endocrine and vision complications such as major headaches or eye problems Long term hyperprolactinaemia can lead to detrimental changes in bone metabolism as a result of hypoestrogenism and hypoandrogenism Studies have shown that chronically elevated prolactin levels lead to increased bone resorption and suppression of bone formation leading to reduced bone density increased risk of fractures and increased risk of osteoporosis The chronic presence of hyperprolactinemia can lead to hypogonadism and osteolysis in men
Niemann Pick type C has a wide clinical spectrum Affected individuals may have enlargement of the spleen splenomegaly and liver hepatomegaly or enlarged spleen or liver combined hepatosplenomegaly but this finding may be absent in later onset cases Prolonged jaundice or elevated bilirubin can present at birth In some cases however enlargement of the spleen or liver does not occur for months or years or not at all Enlargement of the spleen or liver frequently becomes less apparent with time in contrast to the progression of other lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann Pick disease Types A and B or Gaucher disease Organ enlargement does not usually cause major complications Progressive neurological disease is the hallmark of Niemann Pick type C disease and is responsible for disability and premature death in all cases beyond early childhood Classically children with NPC may initially present with delays in reaching normal developmental milestones skills before manifesting cognitive decline dementia Neurological signs and symptoms include cerebellar ataxia unsteady walking with uncoordinated limb movements dysarthria slurred speech dysphagia difficulty in swallowing tremor epilepsy both partial and generalized vertical supranuclear palsy upgaze palsy downgaze palsy saccadic palsy or paralysis sleep inversion gelastic cataplexy sudden loss of muscle tone or drop attacks dystonia abnormal movements or postures caused by contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles across joints most commonly begins with inturning of one foot when walking action dystonia and may spread to become generalized spasticity velocity dependent increase in muscle tone hypotonia ptosis drooping of the upper eyelid microcephaly abnormally small head psychosis progressive dementia progressive hearing loss bipolar disorder major and psychotic depression that can include hallucinations delusions mutism or stupor In the terminal stages of Niemann Pick type C disease the patient is bedridden with complete ophthalmoplegia loss of volitional movement and severe dementia
The individual may experience many symptoms including weight loss poor appetite and lethargy jaundice and bruising may also be present
Newborn The infantile form usually comes to medical attention within the first few months of life The usual presenting features are cardiomegaly 92 hypotonia 88 cardiomyopathy 88 respiratory distress 78 muscle weakness 63 feeding difficulties 57 and failure to thrive 50 The main clinical findings include floppy baby appearance delayed motor milestones and feeding difficulties Moderate hepatomegaly may or may not be present Facial features include macroglossia wide open mouth wide open eyes nasal flaring due to respiratory distress and poor facial muscle tone Cardiopulmonary involvement is manifested by increased respiratory rate use of accessory muscles for respiration recurrent chest infections decreased air entry in the left lower zone due to cardiomegaly arrhythmias and evidence of heart failure Before developing a treatment median age at death in untreated cases was 8 7 months usually due to cardiorespiratory failure However this outcome is drastically changed since treatment has been available improving with early access to treatment
The usual signs and symptoms of pregnancy do not significantly interfere with activities of daily living or pose a health threat to the mother or baby However pregnancy complications can cause other more severe symptoms such as those associated with anemia Common signs and symptoms of pregnancy include
In a majority of specific phobias affected individuals experience heightened anxiety when exposed to a phobic trigger While BII phobics experience a similar reaction initially upon exposure most ultimately respond to a trigger with a biphasic or two phase fainting response In the first phase phobics often experience an anxiety reaction characterized by elevated heart rate and heightened blood pressure as occurs in most other phobias This is the result of increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system However with BII phobia a second phase usually follows closely in which the phobic individual experiences a massive dip in heart rate and blood pressure known as vasovagal response Stimulation of the vagus nerve a part of the parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for promoting the lowered heart rate and decreased blood pressure These physiological changes limit blood flow to the brain and can promote pre syncope lightheadedness feelings of faintness and syncope fainting categorized in this instance as vasovagal fainting This second fainting phase is not common to other phobias A fainting response pattern is not seen in all individuals with BII phobia but is found in a majority Up to 80 of those with BII phobia report either syncope or pre syncope as a symptom when exposed to a trigger Other symptoms that may evolve when exposed to phobic triggers include extreme chest discomfort tunnel vision becoming pale shock vertigo diaphoresis profuse sweating nausea and in very rare cases asystole cardiac arrest and death Increase in stress hormone release particularly of cortisol and corticotrophin is typical Neurological responses to phobic triggers include activation of the bilateral occipito parietal cortex and the thalamus It has also been suggested that exposing a BII phobic individual to a trigger will lead to decreased activity in the brains medial prefrontal cortex MPFC Diminished MPFC activity has been linked with impaired ability to control emotional responses This lessened emotional control could contribute to a general lack of control over symptoms of anxiety arising when exposed to a phobic trigger
Prediabetes typically has no distinct signs or symptoms except the sole sign of high blood sugar Patients should monitor for signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus such as increased thirst increased urination and feeling tired
Common symptoms of infection with the virus are polyarthritis rash and fever Other symptoms include eye pain chest pain lymphadenitis and lethargy The disease is self limiting No fatalities due to infection are known
Ventricular fibrillation is a cause of cardiac arrest The ventricular muscle twitches randomly rather than contracting in a co ordinated fashion from the apex of the heart to the outflow of the ventricles and so the ventricles fail to pump blood around the body because of this it is classified as a cardiac arrest rhythm and patients in V fib should be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR and prompt defibrillation Left untreated ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body including the heart are starved of oxygen and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli Prior to cardiac arrest patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause Patients may exhibit signs of agonal breathing which to a layperson can look like normal spontaneous breathing but is a sign of hypoperfusion of the brainstem It has an appearance on electrocardiography of irregular electrical activity with no discernable pattern It may be described as coarse or fine depending on its amplitude or as progressing from coarse to fine V fib Coarse V fib may be more responsive to defibrillation while fine V fib can mimic the appearance of asystole on a defibrillator or cardiac monitor set to a low gain Some clinicians may attempt to defibrillate fine V fib in the hope that it can be reverted to a cardiac rhythm compatible with life whereas others will deliver CPR and sometimes drugs as described in the advanced cardiac life support protocols in an attempt to increase its amplitude and the odds of successful defibrillation
Hypertensive encephalopathy is most commonly encountered in young and middle aged people who have hypertension Overall the condition is rare even among people with hypertension Studies report that from 0 5 to 15 of people with malignant hypertension develop hypertensive encephalopathy With the development of methods for detection and treatment of hypertension hypertensive encephalopathy has been becoming more rare Symptoms of hypertensive encephalopathy typically start to occur 12 48 hours after a sudden and sustained increase in blood pressure The first manifestation of these symptoms is a severe headache Headache occurs in greater than 75 of patients The patient becomes restless Alterations in consciousness may follow several hours later which include impaired judgement and memory confusion somnolence and stupor If the condition is not treated these neurological symptoms may worsen and ultimately turn into a coma Other symptoms may include increased irritability vomiting diplopia seizures twitching and myoclonus of the limbs Alterations in vision vision blurring hemivisual field defects color blindness cortical blindness are common They occur in 4 out of 11 cases Jellinek et al 1964 Hemiparesis intracerebral hemorrhage aphasia may also occur but they are less common
Signs and symptoms are nonspecific and generally related to the blood cytopenias
Depending on the site of infection tularemia has six characteristic clinical variants ulceroglandular the most common type representing 75 of all forms glandular oropharyngeal pneumonic oculoglandular and typhoidal The incubation period for tularemia is one to 14 days most human infections become apparent after three to five days In most susceptible mammals the clinical signs include fever lethargy loss of appetite signs of sepsis and possibly death Nonhuman mammals rarely develop the skin lesions seen in people Subclinical infections are common and animals often develop specific antibodies to the organism Fever is moderate or very high and tularemia bacilli can be isolated from blood cultures at this stage The face and eyes redden and become inflamed Inflammation spreads to the lymph nodes which enlarge and may suppurate mimicking bubonic plague Lymph node involvement is accompanied by a high fever
The incubation period in human cases remains unknown but in a person who underwent voluntary inoculation erythema and central thickening appear by the fourth day Most patients present a mild pre eruptive fever that lasts 3 4 days severe headaches and backaches and often itching at the site where the skin lesion develops There is initially a small nodule without any central abrasion This small nodule soon becomes papular and gradually enlarges to reach a maximum diameter of about 15 mm by the end of the second week of infection The draining lymph nodes are also enlarged and tender from about the fifth day following the appearance of the skin lesion The lesion remains mostly nodular but ulcerates during the third week and then gradually heals within five to six weeks leaving a scar In Kenya the lesions were almost always solitary and were found on the upper arm face neck and truck Conversely in Zaire 22 of patients had multiple lesions usually two or three The maximum number of lesions seen in one patient was ten In the case of Zairian patients the lesions were mostly found on the lower limbs with a couple of patients reporting lesions on the upper limbs trunk and head
Pain and itch have very different behavioral response patterns Pain elicits a withdrawal reflex which leads to retraction and therefore a reaction trying to protect an endangered part of the body Itch in contrast creates a scratch reflex which draws one to the affected skin site Itch generates stimulus of a foreign object underneath or upon the skin and also the urge to remove it For example responding to a local itch sensation is an effective way to remove insects from ones skin Scratching has traditionally been regarded as a way to relieve oneself by reducing the annoying itch sensation However there are hedonic aspects to scratching as one would find noxious scratching highly pleasurable This can be problematic with chronic itch patients such as ones with atopic dermatitis who may scratch affected spots until they no longer produce a pleasant or painful sensation instead of when the itch sensation disappears It has been hypothesized that motivational aspects of scratching include the frontal brain areas of reward and decision making These aspects might therefore contribute to the compulsive nature of itch and scratching
In surgery Symptoms include Hypotension Shortness of breath
The major symptoms of XLI include scaling of the skin particularly on the neck trunk and lower extremities The extensor surfaces are typically the most severely affected areas The 4 mm diameter scales adhere to the underlying skin and can be dark brown or gray in color Symptoms may subside during the summer

KFS is associated with many other abnormalities of the body hence thorough evaluation of all patients with fused cervical vertebrae at birth is required Furthermore it is unclear whether KFS is a unique disease or if it is one part of a spectrum of congenital spinal deformities KFS is usually diagnosed after birth The most common signs of the disorder are restricted mobility of the neck and upper spine and a shortened neck with the appearance of a low hairline at the back of the head Associated abnormalities may include Scoliosis sideways curvature of the spine Spina bifida Problems with the kidneys and the ribs Cleft palate Dental problems delayed dentition cavities missing teeth Respiratory problems Heart defects Short stature Duane syndrome Srbs anomaly Sprengels deformityThe disorder also may be associated with abnormalities of the head and face skeleton sex organs muscles brain and spinal cord arms legs and fingers
The disease primarily affects older adults persons with weakened immune systems pregnant women and newborns Rarely people without these risk factors can also be affected A person with listeriosis usually has fever and muscle aches often preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms Almost everyone who is diagnosed with listeriosis has invasive infection meaning that the bacteria spread from their intestines to their bloodstream or other body sites Disease may occur as much as two months after eating contaminated food The symptoms vary with the infected person High risk people other than pregnant women Symptoms can include fever muscle aches headache stiff neck confusion loss of balance and convulsions Pregnant women Pregnant women typically experience only a mild flu like illness However infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage stillbirth premature delivery or life threatening infection of the newborn Previously healthy people People who were previously healthy but were exposed to a very large dose of Listeria can develop a non invasive illness meaning that the bacteria have not spread into their blood stream or other body sites Symptoms can include diarrhea and fever If an animal has eaten food contaminated with Listeria and does not have any symptoms most experts believe that no tests or treatment are needed even for people at high risk for listeriosis
Symptoms of orchitis are similar to those of testicular torsion These can include hematospermia blood in the semen hematuria blood in the urine severe pain visible swelling of a testicle or testicles and often the inguinal lymph nodes on the affected side
The expected symptoms of Bornholm disease include fever pleuritic chest pain or epigastric abdominal pain that is frequently spasmodic Bornholm associated chest pain is distinguished by attacks of severe pain in the lower chest often on the right side In a prior study the episodes were shown to last five to ten minutes and then subside for thirty minutes The pain is exacerbated by movement and makes walking and breathing more difficult Patients have found relief from the pain by lying still for a brief period of time The slightest movement of the rib cage causes a sharp increase in pain which makes it difficult to breathe although it generally passes off before any actual harm occurs The attacks are unpredictable and strike out of the blue with a feeling like an iron grip around the rib cage The colloquial names for the disease such as the devils grip see other names below reflect this symptom Bornholm disease is a clinical diagnosis that uses the spasmodic pain fever and relapses to distinguish the illness from other potential causes of pain such as appendicitis or myocardial infarction Tachycardia and arrhythmias have been found with Bornholm disease by using an electrocardiogram ECG Murmurs rubs and pericardial effusions have been detected on physical examination Maculopapular rashes can also be present with Bornholm disease
Paravaccinia virus presents itself with blisters nodules or lesions about 4 mm in diameter typically in the area that has made contact with livestock that is infected with bovine papular stomatitis Lesions may begin forming as late as three weeks after contact has been made with an infected animal In rare cases lesions may be seen systemic General signs of infection are also common such as fever and fatigue Infected livestock may present with blisters or lesions on their udders or snout Often however infected livestock show little to no symptoms
The signs and symptoms of non Hodgkin lymphoma vary depending upon its location within the body Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes fever night sweats weight loss and tiredness Other symptoms may include bone pain chest pain or itchiness Some forms are slow growing while others are fast growing Enlarged lymph nodes may cause lumps to be felt under the skin when they are close to the surface of the body Lymphomas in the skin may also result in lumps which are commonly itchy red or purple Lymphomas in the brain can cause weakness seizures problems with thinking and personality changes While an association between non Hodgkin lymphoma and endometriosis has been described these associations are tentative
The first symptom of CJD is usually rapidly progressive dementia leading to memory loss personality changes and hallucinations Myoclonus jerky movements typically occurs in 90 of cases but may be absent at initial onset Other frequently occurring features include anxiety depression paranoia obsessive compulsive symptoms and psychosis This is accompanied by physical problems such as speech impairment balance and coordination dysfunction ataxia changes in gait and rigid posture In most people with CJD these symptoms are accompanied by involuntary movements The duration of the disease varies greatly but sporadic non inherited CJD can be fatal within months or even weeks Most affected people die six months after initial symptoms appear often of pneumonia due to impaired coughing reflexes About 15 of people with CJD survive for two or more years The symptoms of CJD are caused by the progressive death of the brains nerve cells which are associated with the build up of abnormal prion proteins forming in the brain When brain tissue from a person with CJD is examined under a microscope many tiny holes can be seen where the nerve cells have died Parts of the brain may resemble a sponge where the prions were infecting the areas of the brain
Symptoms of holoprosencephaly range from mild no facial organ defects anosmia or only a single central incisor to moderate to severe cyclopia The symptoms are dependent upon the classification type There are four classifications of holoprosencephaly as well as a mild microform
Unlike the chest tightness of angina in those who have not had a heart transplant people with CAV typically do not experience chest pain because the donor heart has lost its nerve supply A few regain nerves some years later and may develop unusual chest pain People with CAV may present with a broad spectrum of symptoms including tiredness nausea or abdominal discomfort or may have no symptoms at all Shortness of breath and arrythmias may also occur
ED is characterized by the regular or repeated inability to achieve or maintain an erection of sufficient rigidity to accomplish sexual activity It is defined as the persistent or recurrent inability to achieve and maintain a penile erection of sufficient rigidity to permit satisfactory sexual activity for at least 3 months
Most patients with ML IV show psychomotor retardation i e delayed development of movement and coordination corneal opacity retinal degeneration and other ophthalmological abnormalities Other symptoms include agenesis of the corpus callosum iron deficiency resulting from an absence of acid secretion in the stomach achlorhydria Achlorhydria in these patients results in an increase in blood gastrin levels These symptoms typically manifest early in life within the first year After disease onset there occurs a period of stability typically lasting two to three decades during which very little disease progression occurs
The incubation period of California encephalitis is usually 3 7 days An early symptoms phase of 1 4 days commonly precedes the onset of encephalitis manifesting as fever chills nausea vomiting headache lethargy and abdominal pain The encephalitis is characterized by fever drowsiness and lack of mental alertness and orientation Seizures occur in 50 of children Focal neurologic findings like focal motor abnormalities and paralysis irregular and abnormal reflexes develop in 20 of children 10 of patients develop coma The total duration of illness rarely exceeds 10 14 days Recurrent unprovoked seizures occur even after the illness has passed develops in 20 of patients especially those who had seizures during the acute illness In adults infection is asymptomatic which means that the patient is a carrier of the infection but experiences no symptoms or only mild feverish illness The mortality rate is less than 1 and most patients with encephalitis clinical symptoms recover completely Up to 20 of patients develop behavioral problems or recurrent seizures
Delayed ejaculation can be mild men who still experience orgasm during intercourse but only under certain conditions moderate cannot ejaculate during intercourse but can during fellatio or manual stimulation severe can ejaculate only when alone or most severe cannot ejaculate at all All forms may result in a sense of sexual frustration In most cases delayed ejaculation presents the condition in which the man can climax and ejaculate only during masturbation but not during sexual intercourse
The first symptoms most people notice are difficulty reading fine print particularly in low light conditions eyestrain when reading for long periods blurring of near objects or temporarily blurred vision when changing the viewing distance Many extreme presbyopes complain that their arms have become too short to hold reading material at a comfortable distance Presbyopia like other focal imperfections becomes less noticeable in bright sunlight when the pupil becomes smaller As with any lens increasing the focal ratio of the lens increases depth of field by reducing the level of blur of out of focus objects compare the effect of aperture on depth of field in photography The onset of presbyopia varies among those with certain professions and those with miotic pupils In particular farmers and homemakers seek correction later whereas service workers and construction workers seek correction earlier Scuba divers with interest in underwater photography may notice presbyopic changes while diving before they recognize the symptoms in their normal routines due to the near focus in low light conditions
Several types of childhood arthritis exist the most common being juvenile idiopathic arthritis JIA also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis JRA or juvenile chronic arthritis JCA Other types of childhood arthritis include juvenile myositis juvenile lupus juvenile scleroderma vasculitis and fibromyalgia JRA again can be divided into three main forms The classification is based upon symptoms number of joints involved and the presence of certain antibodies in the blood Polyarticular arthritis is the first type of arthritis which affects about 30 40 of children with arthritis and is more common in girls than boys Typically five or more joints are affected usually smaller joints such as the hands and feet but many also affect the hips neck shoulders and jaw Oligoarticular aka pauciarticular arthritis can be early or late onset and is the second type of arthritis affecting about 50 of children with juvenile arthritis This type affects fewer than four joints usually the large joints such as knees ankles or wrists and may cause eye inflammation in girls with positive anti nuclear antibodies ANA Girls younger than eight are more likely to develop this type of arthritis Systemic disease is the least common form with 10 20 of children boys and girls equally being affected with limited movement swelling and pain in at least one joint A common symptom of this type is a high spiking fever of 103 F 39 4 C or higher lasting for weeks or months and a rash of pale red spots on the chest thighs or other parts of the body may be visible
In an acute context hypoxemia can cause symptoms such as those in respiratory distress These include breathlessness an increased rate of breathing use of the chest and abdominal muscles to breathe and lip pursing 642 Chronic hypoxemia may be compensated or uncompensated The compensation may cause symptoms to be overlooked initially however further disease or a stress such as any increase in oxygen demand may finally unmask the existing hypoxemia In a compensated state blood vessels supplying less ventilated areas of the lung may selectively contract to redirect the blood to areas of the lungs which are better ventilated However in a chronic context and if the lungs are not well ventilated generally this mechanism can result in pulmonary hypertension overloading the right ventricle of the heart and causing cor pulmonale and right sided heart failure Polycythemia can also occur In children chronic hypoxemia may manifest as delayed growth neurological development and motor development and decreased sleep quality with frequent sleep arousals Other symptoms of hypoxemia may include cyanosis digital clubbing and symptoms that may relate to the cause of the hypoxemia including cough and hemoptysis 642 Serious hypoxemia typically occurs when the partial pressure of oxygen in blood is less than 60 mmHg 8 0 kPa the beginning of the steep portion of the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve where a small decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen results in a large decrease in the oxygen content of the blood Severe hypoxia can lead to respiratory failure
The onset of respiratory difficulty occurs at the first day of life and continues up to three weeks into the infants life at which point treatment is needed for infant survival
Pain and stiffness in the joint at the base of the big toe during use walking standing bending etc Difficulty with certain activities running squatting Swelling and inflammation around the jointAlthough the condition is degenerative it can occur in patients who are relatively young particularly active sports people who have at some time suffered trauma to the joint turf toe A notable example is NBA star Shaquille ONeal who returned to basketball after surgery
Hartnup disease manifests during infancy with variable clinical presentation failure to thrive photosensitivity intermittent ataxia nystagmus and tremor Nicotinamide is necessary for neutral amino acid transporter production in the proximal renal tubules found in the kidney and intestinal mucosal cells found in the small intestine Therefore a symptom stemming from this disorder results in increased amounts of amino acids in the urine Pellagra a similar condition is also caused by low nicotinamide this disorder results in dermatitis diarrhea and dementia Hartnup disease is a disorder of amino acid transport in the intestine and kidneys otherwise the intestine and kidneys function normally and the effects of the disease occur mainly in the brain and skin Symptoms may begin in infancy or early childhood but sometimes they begin as late as early adulthood Symptoms may be triggered by sunlight fever drugs or emotional or physical stress A period of poor nutrition nearly always precedes an attack The attacks usually become progressively less frequent with age Most symptoms occur sporadically and are caused by a deficiency of niacinamide A rash develops on parts of the body exposed to the sun Mental retardation short stature headaches unsteady gait and collapsing or fainting are common Psychiatric problems such as anxiety rapid mood changes delusions and hallucinations may also result
Excessive blinking and spasming of one or both eyes characterized by uncontrollable eyelid closure of durations longer than the typical blink reflex The spells of spasming may last for minutes or even hours Uncontrollable contractions or twitches of the eye muscles and surrounding facial area Some sufferers have twitching symptoms that radiate into the nose face cheeks and sometimes the neck area Dryness of the eyes Sensitivity to the sun and bright light
At the early stage a retinal hemorrhage may not show any symptom at all Some symptoms may include
Typically there is initial redness followed by varying degrees of pain proportional in severity to both the duration and intensity of exposure Other symptoms can include blistering swelling edema itching pruritus peeling skin rash nausea fever chills and fainting syncope Also a small amount of heat is given off from the burn caused by the concentration of blood in the healing process giving a warm feeling to the affected area Sunburns may be classified as superficial or partial thickness burns Blistering is a sign of second degree sunburn
ALK positive ALCL occurs mostly but not exclusively in children and young adults and is slightly more common in males Most individuals present with stage III or IV i e advanced disease They evidence systemic symptoms including B symptoms such as fever night sweats and weight loss in 75 of cases lymph node enlargement 90 including those in the mediastinum 36 and lymphomatous lesions in the skin 26 bone 14 soft tissues 15 lung 12 and or liver 8 Tumor cells are found in the bone marrow in up to 40 of the cases when immunohistochemical analysis is performed Involvement of the central nervous system or a leukemia like circulation of malignant cells in the blood occurs only very rarely Most patients including up to 90 of young children and adolescents have circulating autoantibodies directed against the ALK fusion protein expressed by their tumor cells
The classic symptoms of pertussis are a paroxysmal cough inspiratory whoop and fainting or vomiting after coughing The cough from pertussis has been documented to cause subconjunctival hemorrhages rib fractures urinary incontinence hernias and vertebral artery dissection Violent coughing can cause the pleura to rupture leading to a pneumothorax Vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing almost doubles the likelihood that the illness is pertussis The absence of a paroxysmal cough or posttussive emesis though makes it almost half as likely The illness usually starts with mild respiratory symptoms include mild coughing sneezing or a runny nose known as the catarrhal stage After one or two weeks the coughing classically develops into uncontrollable fits sometimes followed by a high pitched whoop sound as the person tries to inhale About 50 of children and adults whoop at some point in diagnosed pertussis cases during the paroxysmal stage This stage usually lasts two to eight weeks or sometimes longer A gradual transition then occurs to the convalescent stage which usually lasts one to four weeks This stage is marked by a decrease in paroxysms of coughing although paroxysms may occur with subsequent respiratory infection for many months after the onset of pertussis Symptoms of pertussis can be variable especially between immunized and non immunized people Those that are immunized can present with a more mild infection they may only have the paroxysmal cough for a couple of weeks and it may lack the whooping characteristic Although immunized people have a milder form of the infection they can spread the disease to others who are not immune
In majority of cases spondylolysis presents asymptomatically which can make diagnosis both difficult and incidental When a patient does present with symptoms there are general signs and symptoms a clinician will look for
Protrusio acetabuli may be asymptomatic Limitation of joint range of movement is the earliest sign along with pain
Symptoms of opisthorchiasis are indistinguishable from clonorchiasis About 80 of infected people have no symptoms though they can have eosinophilia Asymptomatic infection can occur when there are less than 1000 eggs in one gram of feces Infection is considered heavy when there are 10 000 30 000 eggs in one gram of feces Symptoms of heavier infections may include diarrhea epigastric and right upper quadrant pain lack of appetite fatigue yellowing of the eyes and skin and mild fever These parasites are long lived and cause heavy chronic infections that may lead to accumulation of fluid in the legs edema and in the peritoneal cavity ascites enlarged non functional gallbladder and also ascending cholangitis which can lead to periductal fibrosis cholecystitis and cholelithiasis obstructive jaundice hepatomegaly and or portal hypertension
If fecal matter passes through the fistula into the bladder the existence of the fistula may be revealed by pneumaturia fecaluria or recurrent urinary tract infection Migration of urine through the fistula into the bowel may cause rectal passage of urine
The carcinoid syndrome occurs in approximately 5 of carcinoid tumors and becomes manifest when vasoactive substances from the tumors enter the systemic circulation escaping hepatic degradation If the primary tumor is from the gastrointestinal tract hence releasing serotonin into the hepatic portal circulation carcinoid syndrome generally does not occur until the disease is so advanced that it overwhelms the livers ability to metabolize the released serotonin Flushing The most important clinical finding is flushing of the skin usually of the head and the upper part of thorax Diarrhea It may be associated with abdominal cramping This symptom is due to the action of serotonin histamine and gastrin Abdominal pain It is due to hepatomegaly small bowel obstruction or lack of oxygen to small bowel Bronchoconstriction which may be histamine or serotonin induced affects about 15 of those having carcinoid syndrome and often accompanies flushing sneezing and shortness of breath Carcinoid heart disease About 19 to 60 of the those affected by carcinoid syndrome develop carcinoid heart disease Serotonin induces fibrosis in valves of the right heart especially tricuspid valve
The presentation depends if it is mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome the most common though not the only types Among the symptoms for the aforementioned types are enlarged lymph nodes an enlarged liver and spleen and non specific dermatitis
The most common presentation of cerebrovascular diseases is an acute stroke which occurs when blood supply to the brain is compromised Symptoms of stroke are usually rapid in onset and may include weakness of one side of the face or body numbness on one side of the face or body inability to produce or understand speech vision changes and balance difficulties Hemorrhagic strokes can present with a very severe sudden headache associated with vomiting neck stiffness and decreased consciousness Symptoms vary depending on the location and the size of the area of involvement of the stroke Edema or swelling of the brain may occur which increases intracranial pressure and may result in brain herniation A stroke may result in coma or death if it involves key areas of the brain Other symptoms of cerebrovascular disease include migraines seizures epilepsy or cognitive decline However cerebrovascular disease may go undetected for years until an acute stroke occurs In addition patients with some rare congenital cerebrovascular diseases may begin to have these symptoms in childhood
Once the lymph channels are blocked one may open into the kidney hilum or ureter or sometimes into the bladder and chyle can leak into the urinary tract resulting in milky white urine Blood sometimes mixes with the urine resulting in haemato chyluria Usually the condition is self limiting and can sometimes lead to complications If left untreated chronic chyluria can lead to malnutrition and fat soluble vitamin deficiency
The skin of the face normally around the mouth and the mucosa of the mouth and or throat as well as the tongue swell over the period of minutes to hours The swelling can also occur elsewhere typically in the hands The swelling can be itchy or painful There may also be slightly decreased sensation in the affected areas due to compression of the nerves Urticaria hives may develop simultaneously In severe cases stridor of the airway occurs with gasping or wheezy inspiratory breath sounds and decreasing oxygen levels Tracheal intubation is required in these situations to prevent respiratory arrest and risk of death Sometimes the cause is recent exposure to an allergen e g peanuts but more often it is either idiopathic unknown or only weakly correlated to allergen exposure In hereditary angioedema HAE often no direct cause is identifiable although mild trauma including dental work and other stimuli can cause attacks There is usually no associated itch or urticaria as it is not an allergic response Patients with HAE can also have recurrent episodes often called attacks of abdominal pain usually accompanied by intense vomiting weakness and in some cases watery diarrhea and an unraised nonitchy splotchy swirly rash These stomach attacks can last one to five days on average and can require hospitalization for aggressive pain management and hydration Abdominal attacks have also been known to cause a significant increase in the patients white blood cell count usually in the vicinity of 13 000 to 30 000 As the symptoms begin to diminish the white count slowly begins to decrease returning to normal when the attack subsides As the symptoms and diagnostic tests are almost indistinguishable from an acute abdomen e g perforated appendicitis it is possible for undiagnosed HAE patients to undergo laparotomy operations on the abdomen or laparoscopy keyhole surgery that turns out to have been unnecessary HAE may also cause swelling in a variety of other locations most commonly the limbs genitals neck throat and face The pain associated with these swellings varies from mildly uncomfortable to agonizing pain depending on its location and severity Predicting where and when the next episode of edema will occur is impossible Most patients have an average of one episode per month but there are also patients who have weekly episodes or only one or two episodes per year The triggers can vary and include infections minor injuries mechanical irritation operations or stress In most cases edema develops over a period of 12 36 hours and then subsides within 2 5 days
Fractures of facial bones like other fractures may be associated with pain bruising and swelling of the surrounding tissues such symptoms can occur in the absence of fractures as well Fractures of the nose base of the skull or maxilla may be associated with profuse nosebleeds Nasal fractures may be associated with deformity of the nose as well as swelling and bruising Deformity in the face for example a sunken cheekbone or teeth which do not align properly suggests the presence of fractures Asymmetry can suggest facial fractures or damage to nerves People with mandibular fractures often have pain and difficulty opening their mouths and may have numbness in the lip and chin With Le Fort fractures the midface may move relative to the rest of the face or skull
Symptoms of iron deficiency can occur even before the condition has progressed to iron deficiency anemia Symptoms of iron deficiency are not unique to iron deficiency i e not pathognomonic Iron is needed for many enzymes to function normally so a wide range of symptoms may eventually emerge either as the secondary result of the anemia or as other primary results of iron deficiency Symptoms of iron deficiency include fatigue dizziness lightheadedness pallor hair loss twitches irritability weakness pica brittle or grooved nails hair thinning Plummer Vinson syndrome painful atrophy of the mucous membrane covering the tongue the pharynx and the esophagus impaired immune function pagophagia restless legs syndromeContinued iron deficiency may progress to anemia and worsening fatigue Thrombocytosis or an elevated platelet count can also result A lack of sufficient iron levels in the blood is one reason that some people cannot donate blood
The extent and severity of the symptoms of cerebral edema depend on the exact etiology but are generally related to an acute increase of the pressure within the skull As the skull is a fixed and inelastic space the accumulation of cerebral edema can displace and compress vital brain tissue cerebral spinal fluid and blood vessels according to the Monro Kellie doctrine Increased intracranial pressure ICP is a life threatening surgical emergency marked by symptoms of headache nausea vomiting decreased consciousness Symptoms are frequently accompanied by visual disturbances such as gaze paresis reduced vision and dizziness Increased pressures within the skull can cause a compensatory elevation of blood pressure to maintain cerebral blood flow which when associated with irregular breathing and a decreased heart rate is called the Cushing reflex The Cushing reflex often indicates compression of the brain on brain tissue and blood vessels leading to decreased blood flow to the brain and eventually death
The hallmark sign of urethral stricture is a weak urinary stream Other symptoms include Splaying of the urinary stream Urinary frequency Urinary urgency Straining to urinate Pain during urination Urinary tract infection Prostatitis Inability to completely empty the bladder Some people with severe urethral strictures are completely unable to urinate This is referred to as acute urinary retention and is a medical emergency Hydronephrosis and kidney failure may also occur
Anaphylaxis typically presents many different symptoms over minutes or hours with an average onset of 5 to 30 minutes if exposure is intravenous and up to 2 hours if from eating food The most common areas affected include skin 80 90 respiratory 70 gastrointestinal 30 45 heart and vasculature 10 45 and central nervous system 10 15 with usually two or more being involved
Neurofibromatosis type 1 in early life may cause learning and behavior problems about 60 of children who have NF1 have mild difficulty in school Signs the individual might have are as follows Six or more light brown dermatological spots café au lait spots At least two neurofibromas At least two growths on the eyes iris Abnormal growth of the spine scoliosis People with neurofibromatosis type 2 can exhibit the same type of skin symptoms as type 1 but not necessarily in every case The symptom most characteristic of NF2 is hearing loss The hearing loss occurs due to the pressure of tumors on the acoustic nerve The same pressure can cause headaches dizziness and nausea The main symptom of schwannomatosis is localized pain This pain is due to tissues and nerves experiencing more pressure because of nearby tumors
When adult worms attach to the villi of the small intestine they suck on the hosts blood which may cause abdominal pain diarrhea cramps and weight loss that can lead to anorexia Heavy infections can lead to the development of iron deficiency and hypochromic microcytic anemia This form of anemia in children can give rise to physical and mental retardation Infection caused by cutaneous larvae migrans a skin disease in humans is characterized by skin ruptures and severe itching
The disease is most often biphasic After an incubation period of approximately one week range 4 28 days from exposure tick bite non speciﬁc symptoms occurs These symptoms are fever malaise headache nausea vomiting and myalgias that persist for about 5 days Then after approximately one week without symptoms some of the infected develop neurological symptoms i e meningitis encephalitis or meningoencephalitis Myelitis also occurs with or without encephalitis Sequelae persists for a year or more in approximately one third of people who develop neurological disease Most common long term symptoms are headache concentration difficulties memory impairment and other symptoms of cognitive dysfunction Mortality depends on the subtype of the virus For the European subtype mortality rates are 0 5 to 2 for people who develop neurological disease In dogs the disease also manifests as a neurological disorder with signs varying from tremors to seizures and death In ruminants neurological disease is also present and animals may refuse to eat appear lethargic and also develop respiratory signs
The earliest appearance of dyscalculia is typically a deficit in subitizing the ability to know from a brief glance and without counting how many objects there are in a small group Children as young as five can subitize six objects especially looking at a die However children with dyscalculia can subitize fewer objects and even when correct take longer to identify the number than their age matched peers Dyscalculia often looks different at different ages It tends to become more apparent as children get older however symptoms can appear as early as preschool Common symptoms of dyscalculia are having difficulty with mental math trouble analyzing time and reading an analog clock struggle with motor sequencing that involves numbers and often counting on fingers when adding numbers
People with intracerebral bleeding have symptoms that correspond to the functions controlled by the area of the brain that is damaged by the bleed These localizing signs and symptoms can include hemiplegia or weakness localized to one side of the body and paresthesia loss of sensation including hemisensory loss if localized to one side of the body These symptoms are usually rapid in onset sometimes occurring in minutes but not as rapid as the symptom onset in ischemic stroke Other symptoms include those that indicate a rise in intracranial pressure caused by a large mass due to hematoma expansion putting pressure on the brain These symptoms include headaches nausea vomiting a depressed level of consciousness stupor and death Continued elevation in the intracranial pressure and the accompanying mass effect may eventually cause brain herniation when different parts of the brain are displaced or shifted to new areas in relation to the skull and surrounding dura mater supporting structures Brain herniation is associated with hyperventilation extensor rigidity pupillary asymmetry pyramidal signs coma and death Hemorrhage into the basal ganglia or thalamus causes contralateral hemiplegia due to damage to the internal capsule Other possible symptoms include gaze palsies or hemisensory loss Intracerebral hemorrhage into the cerebellum may cause ataxia vertigo incoordination of limbs and vomiting Some cases of cerebellar hemorrhage lead to blockage of the fourth ventricle with subsequent impairment of drainage of cerebrospinal fluid from the brain The ensuing hydrocephalus or fluid buildup in the ventricles of the brain leads to a decreased level of consciousness and coma Brainstem hemorrhage most commonly occurs in the pons and is associated with cranial nerve palsies pinpoint but reactive pupils gaze palsies facial weakness and coma if there is damage to the reticular activating system
The length of time between exposure to the bacteria and the appearance of symptoms incubation period is generally 2 10 days but can more rarely extend to as long as 20 days For the general population among those exposed between 0 1 and 5 0 develop the disease while among those in hospital between 0 4 and 14 develop the disease Those with Legionnaires disease usually have fever chills and a cough which may be dry or may produce sputum Almost all experience fever while around half have cough with sputum and one third cough up blood or bloody sputum Some also have muscle aches headache tiredness loss of appetite loss of coordination ataxia chest pain or diarrhea and vomiting Up to half of those with Legionnaires disease have gastrointestinal symptoms and almost half have neurological symptoms including confusion and impaired cognition Relative bradycardia may also be present which is low to normal heart rate despite the presence of a fever Laboratory tests may show that kidney functions liver functions and electrolyte levels are abnormal which may include low sodium in the blood Chest X rays often show pneumonia with consolidation in the bottom portion of both lungs Distinguishing Legionnaires disease from other types of pneumonia by symptoms or radiologic findings alone is difficult other tests are required for definitive diagnosis People with Pontiac fever a much milder illness caused by the same bacterium experience fever and muscle aches without pneumonia They generally recover in 2 5 days without treatment For Pontiac fever the time between exposure and symptoms is generally a few hours to two days
The symptoms of this disease include Severe pruritus Pain Inflammation and swelling Lesions and ulcerations with black dots in the centerIf a Tunga infection is left untreated secondary infections such as bacteremia tetanus necrosis and gangrene may be expected In all cases tungiasis by itself only caused morbidity though secondary infection may lead to mortality The life cycle section presents the Fortaleza stages from the fleas developmental perspective The discussion is specific to symptoms of human infection The clinical presentation in humans follows the Fortaleza Classification as the stage of infection will determine the symptoms present The following discussion will give an overview of the symptoms beginning in stage 2 because patients are not likely to present themselves at the early stages of infection mostly because the fleas burrowing is usually not felt This may be due to a keratolytic enzyme secreted during stage 1 The patient with a single flea may present as early as stage 2 when though the erythema is barely perceptible a boring pain and the curious sensation of pleasant itching occur This inflammatory reaction is the initial immunological response to the infestation Heavily infested patients may not notice a stage 2 infection due to the other fleas causing irritation as well Feces may be seen but this is more common in the 3rd stage Around the third day after penetration erythema and skin tenderness are felt accompanied by pruritus severe itching and a black furuncular nodule surrounded by a white halo of stretched skin caused by the expansion of the flea Fecal coils may protrude from the center of the nodule where the fleas anus is facing upward They should be washed off quickly as the feces may remain in the skin unless removed During this 3a substage pain can be severe especially at night or if the nodule is on the foot while walking Eggs will also begin to be released and a watery secretion can be observed The radical metamorphosis during the 3rd to 6th day after penetration or neosomy precedes the formation of a small caldera like rim rampart as a result of the increased thickness of the fleas chitin exoskeleton During the caldera formation the nodule shrinks a bit and it looks as if it is beginning to dry out this takes 2 weeks and comprises substage 3b At the third week after penetration and substage 4a the eggs release will have stopped and the lesion will become smaller and more wrinkled As the flea is near death fecal and water secretion will stop altogether Pain tenderness and skin inflammation will still be present Around the 25th day after penetration the lesion looks like a black crust and the fleas carcass is removed by host repair mechanisms and the skin begins to heal With the flea gone inflammation may still persist for a while Although patients would not present within the 5th stage of tungiasis as the flea would be dead and no longer in the body this stage is characterized by the reorganization of the skin 1 4 weeks and a circular residue of 5 10 mm in diameter around the site in penetration An intraepithelial abscess which developed due to the presence of the flea will drain and later heal Although these disease residues would persist for a few months tungiasis is no longer present In severe cases ulcers are common as well as complete tissue and nail deformation A patient may be unable to walk due to severe pain if too many of the lesions are present in the feet Suppuration pus formation tissue death auto amputation of digits via ainhum and chronic lymphedema may also be seen If the patient is not vaccinated tetanus is often a complication due to secondary infection Necrosis and gangrene are other common complications of severe infestation and superinfection Staphylococcus aureus and Wolbachia endobacteria can be transmitted by the chigoe flea as well as nearly 150 other different pathogens For these reasons the chigoe flea should be removed as soon as possible
People with pectus carinatum usually develop normal hearts and lungs but the malformation may prevent these from functioning optimally In moderate to severe cases of pectus carinatum the chest wall is rigidly held in an outward position Thus respirations are inefficient and the individual needs to use the accessory muscles for respiration rather than normal chest muscles during strenuous exercise This negatively affects gas exchange and causes a decrease in stamina Children with pectus malformations often tire sooner than their peers due to shortness of breath and fatigue Commonly concurrent is mild to moderate asthma Some children with pectus carinatum also have scoliosis i e curvature of the spine Some have mitral valve prolapse a condition in which the heart mitral valve functions abnormally Connective tissue disorders involving structural abnormalities of the major blood vessels and heart valves are also seen Although rarely seen some children have other connective tissue disorders including arthritis visual impairment and healing impairment Apart from the possible physiologic consequences pectus malformations can have a significant psychologic impact Some people especially those with milder cases live happily with pectus carinatum For others though the shape of the chest can damage their self image and confidence possibly disrupting social connections and causing them to feel uncomfortable throughout adolescence and adulthood As the child grows older bodybuilding techniques may be useful for balancing visual impact A less common variant of pectus carinatum is pectus arcuatum also called type 2 pectus excavatum chondromanubrial malformation or Currarino Silverman syndrome or pouter pigeon malformation which produces a manubrial and upper sternal protrusion particularly also at the sternal angle Pectus arcuatum is often confused with a combination of pectus carinatum and pectus excavatum but in pectus arcuatum the visual appearance is characterized by a protrusion of the costal cartilages and there is no depression of the sternum
At diagnosis patients typically are in their 60s and present to their physician with advanced disease About half have B symptoms such as fever night sweats or unexplained weight loss over 10 of body weight Enlarged lymph nodes for example a bump on the neck armpits or groin or enlargement of the spleen are usually present Bone marrow liver and gastrointestinal tract involvement occurs relatively early in the course of the disease Mantle cell lymphoma has been reported in rare cases to be associated with severe allergic reactions to mosquito bites These reactions involve extensive allergic reactions to mosquito bites which range from greatly enlarged bite sites that may be painful and involve necrosis to systemic symptoms e g fever swollen lymph nodes abdominal pain and diarrhea or in extremely rare cases to life threatening anaphylaxis In several of these cases the mosquito bite allergy MBA reaction occurred prior to the diagnosis of MCL suggesting that MBA can be a manifestation of early developing mantle cell lymphoma
Specific area An edema will occur in specific organs as part of inflammations tendinitis or pancreatitis for instance Certain organs develop edema through tissue specific mechanisms Examples of edema in specific organs
The symptoms tend to be similar to AML in general with the following being possible symptoms
Three common descriptions of palpitation are flip flopping or stop and start often caused by premature contraction of the atrium or ventricle with the perceived stop from the pause following the contraction and the start from the subsequent forceful contraction rapid fluttering in the chest with regular fluttering suggesting supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias including sinus tachycardia and irregular fluttering suggesting atrial fibrillation atrial flutter or tachycardia with variable block and pounding in the neck or neck pulsations often due to cannon A waves in the jugular venous pulsations that occur when the right atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid valve Palpitation associated with chest pain suggests coronary artery disease or if the chest pain is relieved by leaning forward pericardial disease is suspected Palpitation associated with light headedness fainting or near fainting suggest low blood pressure and may signify a life threatening abnormal heart rhythm Palpitation that occurs regularly with exertion suggests a rate dependent bypass tract or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy If a benign cause for these concerning symptoms cannot be found at the initial visit then ambulatory monitoring or prolonged heart monitoring in the hospital might be warranted Noncardiac symptoms should also be elicited since the palpitations may be caused by a normal heart responding to a metabolic or inflammatory condition Weight loss suggests hyperthyroidism Palpitation can be precipitated by vomiting or diarrhea that leads to electrolyte disorders and hypovolemia Hyperventilation hand tingling and nervousness are common when anxiety or panic disorder is the cause of the palpitations
The predominant symptom is peripheral sensory neuropathy that is experienced as numbness pins and needles and burning sensations paresthesia in a patients limbs on both sides of their body Patients may experience unsteadiness of gait incoordination ataxia involuntary muscle movements choreoathetosis the sensation of an electric zap in their bodies Lhermittes sign a heightened sensitivity to sense stimuli including photosensitivity hyperesthesia impaired skin sensation hypoesthesia numbness around the mouth and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and heartburn The ability to sense vibrations and to sense ones position are diminished to a greater degree than pain or temperature Skin lesions have also been reported Megavitamin B6 syndrome may also contribute to burning mouth syndrome Potential psychiatric symptoms range from anxiety depression agitation and cognitive deficits to psychosis Symptom severity appears to be dose dependent higher doses cause more severe symptoms and the duration of supplementation with vitamin B6 before onset of systems appears to be inversely proportional to the amount taken daily the smaller the daily dosage the longer it will take for symptoms to develop It is also possible that some individuals are more susceptible to the toxic effects of vitamin B6 than others Megavitamin B6 syndrome has been reported in doses as low as 24 mg day Symptoms may also be dependent on the form of vitamin B6 taken in supplements It has been proposed that vitamin B6 in supplements should be in pyridoxal or pyridoxal phosphate form rather than pyridoxine as these are thought to reduce the likelihood of toxicity A tissue culture study however showed that all B6 vitamers that could be converted into active coenzymes pyridoxal pyridoxine and pyridoxamine were neurotoxic at similar concentrations It has been shown in vivo that supplementing with pyridoxal or pyridoxal phosphate increases pyridoxine concentrations in humans meaning there are metabolic pathways from each vitamer of B6 to the all other forms Consuming high amounts of vitamin B6 from food has not been reported to cause adverse effects Early diagnosis and cessation of vitamin B6 supplementation can reduce the morbidity of the syndrome
The signs and symptoms of helminthiasis depend on a number of factors including the site of the infestation within the body the type of worm involved the number of worms and their volume the type of damage the infesting worms cause and the immunological response of the body Where the burden of parasites in the body is light there may be no symptoms Certain worms may cause particular constellations of symptoms For instance taeniasis can lead to seizures due to neurocysticercosis
Signs and symptoms can arise suddenly and may resolve without treatment Stress exercise and emotion can all result in a normal or physiological increase in heart rate but they can precipitate SVT in rare cases Episodes can last from a few minutes to one or two days They sometimes persist until treated The rapid heart rate if fast enough reduces the opportunity for the pump to fill between beats decreasing cardiac output and consequently blood pressure The following symptoms are typical with a rate of 150 270 or more beats per minute Pounding heart Rapid heart beat Shortness of breath Chest pain Rapid breathing Dizziness Sweating Loss of consciousnessSymptoms of heart arrhythmias such as SVT are more difficult to assess in infants and toddlers because of their limited ability to communicate Caregivers should watch for lack of interest in feeding shallow breathing and lethargy These symptoms may be subtle and may be accompanied by vomiting and or a decrease in responsiveness
People with arachnophobia tend to feel uneasy in any area they believe could harbour spiders or that has visible signs of their presence such as webs If arachnophobes see a spider they may not enter the general vicinity until they have overcome the panic attack that is often associated with their phobia Some people scream cry have emotional outbursts experience trouble breathing sweat and experience increased heart rates when they come in contact with an area near spiders or their webs In some extreme cases even a picture a toy or a realistic drawing of a spider can trigger intense fear
Onset of symptoms begins one to nine days following exposure with an average of five Initial symptoms include changes in taste and smell headache fever nausea vomiting back pain and a stiff neck Secondary symptoms are also meningitis like including confusion hallucinations lack of attention ataxia cramp and seizures After the start of symptoms the disease progresses rapidly over three to seven days with death usually occurring anywhere from seven to fourteen days later although it can take longer In 2013 a man in Taiwan died 25 days after being infected by Naegleria fowleri It affects healthy children or young adults who have recently been exposed to bodies of fresh water Some people have presented with a clinical triad of edematous brain lesions immune suppression and fever Scientists speculate that lower age groups are at a higher risk of contracting the disease because adolescents have a more underdeveloped and porous cribriform plate through which the amoeba travels to reach the brain
A womans breasts change in size volume and position on her chest throughout her life In young women with large breasts sagging may occur early in life due to the effects of gravity It may be primarily caused by the volume and weight of the breasts which are disproportionate to her body size
The symptoms of CVID vary between those affected Its main features are hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections Hypogammaglobulinemia manifests as a significant decrease in the levels of IgG antibodies usually alongside IgA antibodies IgM antibody levels are also decreased in about half of those affected Infections are a direct result of the low antibody levels in the circulation which do not adequately protect them against pathogens The microorganisms that most frequently cause infections in CVID are bacteria Haemophilus influenzae Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus Pathogens less often isolated from those affected include Neisseria meningitidis Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Giardia lamblia Infections mostly affect the respiratory tract nose sinuses bronchi lungs and the ears they can also occur at other sites such as the eyes skin and gastrointestinal tract These infections respond to antibiotics but can recur upon discontinuation of antibiotics Bronchiectasis can develop when severe recurrent pulmonary infections are left untreated In addition to infections people with CVID can develop complications These include
The first signs of dracunculiasis occur around a year after infection as the full grown female worm prepares to leave the infected persons body As the worm migrates to its exit site typically the lower leg though they can emerge anywhere on the body some people have allergic reactions including hives fever dizziness nausea vomiting and diarrhea Upon reaching its destination the worm forms a fluid filled blister under the skin Over 1 3 days the blister grows larger begins to cause severe burning pain and eventually bursts leaving a small open wound The wound remains intensely painful as the worm slowly emerges over several weeks to months In an attempt to alleviate the excruciating burning pain the host will nearly always attempt to submerge the affected body part in water When this occurs and the worm is exposed to water it spews a white substance into the water containing thousands of larvae As the worm emerges the open blister often becomes infected with bacteria resulting in redness and swelling the formation of abscesses or in severe cases gangrene sepsis or lockjaw When the secondary infection is near a joint typically the ankle the damage to the joint can result in stiffness arthritis or contractures Infected people commonly harbor multiple worms with an average 1 8 worms per person up to 40 at a time which will emerge from separate blisters at the same time 90 of worms emerge from the legs or feet However worms can emerge from anywhere on the body
Although it may be asymptomatic symptoms usually are more likely to be present and more severe with larger tongue enlargements Signs and symptoms include
Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia methemoglobin level above 10 include shortness of breath cyanosis mental status changes 50 headache fatigue exercise intolerance dizziness and loss of consciousness People with severe methemoglobinemia methemoglobin level above 50 may exhibit seizures coma and death level above 70 Healthy people may not have many symptoms with methemoglobin levels below 15 However people with co morbidities such as anemia cardiovascular disease lung disease sepsis or who have abnormal hemoglobin species e g carboxyhemoglobin sulfhemoglobinemia or sickle hemoglobin may experience moderate to severe symptoms at much lower levels as low as 5 8
Physical signs High cholesterol levels normally do not cause any symptoms Yellow deposits of cholesterol rich fat may be seen in various places on the body such as around the eyelids known as xanthelasma palpebrarum the outer margin of the iris known as arcus senilis corneae and in the tendons of the hands elbows knees and feet particularly the Achilles tendon known as a tendon xanthoma
A manic episode is defined in the American Psychiatric Associations diagnostic manual as a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated expansive or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day nearly every day or any duration if hospitalization is necessary where the mood is not caused by drugs medication or a non mental medical illness e g hyperthyroidism and a is causing obvious difficulties at work or in social relationships and activities or b requires admission to hospital to protect the person or others or c the person has psychosis To be classified as a manic episode while the disturbed mood and an increase in goal directed activity or energy is present at least three or four if only irritability is present of the following must have been consistently present
The scalp ears back face and upper arm are common sites of sebaceous cysts though they may occur anywhere on the body except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet They are more common in hairier areas where in cases of long duration they could result in hair loss on the skin surface immediately above the cyst They are smooth to the touch vary in size and are generally round in shape They are generally mobile masses that can consist of
Bulimia typically involves rapid and out of control eating which may stop when the person is interrupted by another person or the stomach hurts from over extension followed by self induced vomiting or other forms of purging This cycle may be repeated several times a week or in more serious cases several times a day and may directly cause
Le Fort I Slight swelling of the upper lip ecchymosis is present in the buccal sulcus beneath each zygomatic arch malocclusion mobility of teeth Impacted type of fractures may be almost immobile and it is only by grasping the maxillary teeth and applying a little firm pressure that a characteristic grate can be felt which is diagnostic of the fracture Percussion of upper teeth results in cracked pot sound Guérins sign is present characterised by ecchymosis in the region of greater palatine vessels Le Fort II and Le Fort III common Gross edema of soft tissue over the middle third of the face bilateral circumorbital ecchymosis bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhage epistaxis CSF rhinorrhoea dish face deformity diplopia enophthalmos cracked pot sound Le Fort II Step deformity at infraorbital margin mobile mid face anesthesia or paresthesia of cheek Le Fort III Tenderness and separation at frontozygomatic suture lengthening of face depression of ocular levels enophthalmos hooding of eyes and tilting of occlusal plane an imaginary curved plane between the edges of the incisors and the tips of the posterior teeth As a result there is gagging on the side of injury
SLE is one of several diseases known as the great imitator because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably Diagnosis can thus be elusive with some people having unexplained symptoms of SLE for years Common initial and chronic complaints include fever malaise joint pains muscle pains and fatigue Because these symptoms are so often seen in association with other diseases these signs and symptoms are not part of the diagnostic criteria for SLE When occurring in conjunction with other signs and symptoms however they are considered suggestive While SLE can occur in both males and females it is found far more often in women and the symptoms associated with each sex are different Females tend to have a greater number of relapses a low white blood cell count more arthritis Raynauds phenomenon and psychiatric symptoms Males tend to have more seizures kidney disease serositis inflammation of tissues lining the lungs and heart skin problems and peripheral neuropathy
A popping or cracking sound significant pain swelling immediate loss of erection leading to flaccidity and skin hematoma of various sizes are commonly associated with the sexual event
The symptoms of an elevated potassium level are generally few and nonspecific Nonspecific symptoms may include feeling tired numbness and weakness Occasionally palpitations and shortness of breath may occur Hyperventilation may indicate a compensatory response to metabolic acidosis which is one of the possible causes of hyperkalemia Often however the problem is detected during screening blood tests for a medical disorder or after hospitalization for complications such as cardiac arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death High levels of potassium 5 5 mmol L have been associated with cardiovascular events
In HCL the hairy cells malignant B lymphocytes accumulate in the bone marrow interfering with the production of normal white blood cells red blood cells and platelets Consequently patients may develop infections related to low white blood cell count anemia and fatigue due to a lack of red blood cells or easy bleeding due to a low platelet count Leukemic cells may gather in the spleen and cause it to swell this can have the side effect of making the person feel full even when he or she has not eaten much Hairy cell leukemia is commonly diagnosed after a routine blood count shows unexpectedly low numbers of one or more kinds of normal blood cells or after unexplained bruises or recurrent infections in an otherwise apparently healthy patient Platelet function may be somewhat impaired in HCL patients although this does not appear to have any significant practical effect It may result in somewhat more mild bruises than would otherwise be expected for a given platelet count or a mildly increased bleeding time for a minor cut likely the result of producing slightly abnormal platelets in the overstressed bone marrow tissue Patients with a high tumor burden may also have somewhat reduced levels of cholesterol especially in patients with an enlarged spleen Cholesterol levels return to more normal values with successful treatment of HCL
The variant causes elevated plasma prothrombin levels hyperprothrombinemia possibly due to increased pre mRNA stability Prothrombin is the precursor to thrombin which plays a key role in causing blood to clot blood coagulation G20210A can thus contribute to a state of hypercoagulability but not particularly with arterial thrombosis A 2006 meta analysis showed only a 1 3 fold increased risk for coronary disease Deficiencies in the anticoagulants Protein C and Protein S further increase the risk five to tenfold Behind non O blood type and factor V Leiden prothrombin G20210A is one of the most common genetic risk factors for venous thromboembolism VTE Increased production of prothrombin heightens the risk of blood clotting Moreover individuals who carry the mutation can pass it on to their offspring The mutation increases the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis DVT which can cause pain and swelling and sometimes post thrombotic syndrome ulcers or pulmonary embolism Most individuals do not require treatment but do need to be cautious during periods when the possibility of blood clotting are increased for example during pregnancy after surgery or during long flights Occasionally blood thinning medication may be indicated to reduce the risk of clotting Heterozygous carriers who take combined birth control pills are at a 15 fold increased risk of VTE while carriers also heterozygous with factor V Leiden have an approximate 20 fold higher risk In a recommendation statement on VTE genetic testing for G20210A in adults that developed unprovoked VTE was disadvised as was testing in asymptomatic family members related to G20210A carriers who developed VTE In those who develop VTE the results of thrombophilia tests wherein the variant can be detected rarely play a role in the length of treatment
Mild cases may simply produce a sense of pressure or protrusion within the vagina and the occasional feeling that the rectum has not been completely emptied after a bowel movement Moderate cases may involve difficulty passing stool because the attempt to evacuate pushes the stool into the rectocele instead of out through the anus discomfort or pain during evacuation or intercourse constipation and a general sensation that something is falling down or falling out within the pelvis Severe cases may cause vaginal bleeding intermittent fecal incontinence or even the prolapse of the bulge through the mouth of the vagina or rectal prolapse through the anus Digital evacuation or manual pushing on the posterior wall of the vagina helps to aid in bowel movement in a majority of cases of rectocele Rectocele can be a cause of symptoms of obstructed defecation
Gastrointestinal bleeding can range from small non visible amounts which are only detected by laboratory testing to massive bleeding where bright red blood is passed and shock develops Rapid bleeding may cause syncope The presence of bright red blood in stool known as hematochezia typically indicates lower gastrointestinal bleeding Digested blood from the upper gastrointestinal tract may appear black rather than red resulting in coffee ground vomit or melena Other signs and symptoms include feeling tired dizziness and pale skin color A number of foods and medications can turn the stool either red or black in the absence of bleeding Bismuth found in many antacids may turn stools black as may activated charcoal Blood from the vagina or urinary tract may also be confused with blood in the stool
The signs and symptoms of diastematomyelia may appear at any time of life although the diagnosis is usually made in childhood Cutaneous lesions or stigmata such as a hairy patch dimple Hemangioma subcutaneous mass Lipoma or Teratoma over the affected area of the spine is found in more than half of cases Neurological symptoms are nonspecific indistinguishable from other causes of cord tethering The symptoms are caused by tissue attachments that limit the movement of the spinal cord within the spinal column These attachments cause an abnormal stretching of the spinal cord The course of the disorder is progressive In children symptoms may include the stigmata mentioned above and or foot and spinal deformities weakness in the legs low back pain scoliosis and incontinence In adulthood the signs and symptoms often include progressive sensory and motor problems and loss of bowel and bladder control This delayed presentation of symptoms is related to the degree of strain placed on the spinal cord over time Tethered spinal cord syndrome appears to be the result of improper growth of the neural tube during fetal development and is closely linked to spina bifida Tethering may also develop after spinal cord injury and scar tissue can block the flow of fluids around the spinal cord Fluid pressure may cause cysts to form in the spinal cord a condition called syringomyelia This can lead to additional loss of movement feeling or the onset of pain or autonomic symptoms Cervical diastematomyelia can become symptomatic as a result of acute trauma and can cause major neurological deficits like hemiparesis to result from otherwise mild trauma The following definitions may help to understand some of the related entities
The signs and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism are those of hypercalcemia They are classically summarized by stones bones abdominal groans thrones and psychiatric overtones Stones refers to kidney stones nephrocalcinosis and diabetes insipidus polyuria and polydipsia These can ultimately lead to kidney failure Bones refers to bone related complications The classic bone disease in hyperparathyroidism is osteitis fibrosa cystica which results in pain and sometimes pathological fractures Other bone diseases associated with hyperparathyroidism are osteoporosis osteomalacia and arthritis Abdominal groans refers to gastrointestinal symptoms of constipation indigestion nausea and vomiting Hypercalcemia can lead to peptic ulcers and acute pancreatitis The peptic ulcers can be an effect of increased gastric acid secretion by hypercalcemia Thrones refers to polyuria and constipation Psychiatric overtones refers to effects on the central nervous system Symptoms include lethargy fatigue depression memory loss psychosis ataxia delirium and coma Left ventricular hypertrophy may also be seen Other signs include proximal muscle weakness itching and band keratopathy of the eyes When subjected to formal research symptoms of depression pain and gastric dysfunction seem to correlate with mild cases of hypercalcemia
Signs of meningoencephalitis include unusual behavior personality changes and thinking problems Symptoms may include headache fever pain in neck movement light sensitivity and seizure
In primary hyperparathyroidism about 75 of people are asymptomatic While most primary patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis asymptomatic is poorly defined and represents only those without obvious clinical sequalae such as kidney stones bone disease or hypercalcemic crisis These asymptomatic patients may have other symptoms such as depression anxiety gastrointestinal distress and neuromuscular problems that are not counted as symptoms The problem is often picked up incidentally during blood work for other reasons and the test results show a higher amount of calcium in the blood than normal Many people only have non specific symptoms Common manifestations of hypercalcemia include weakness and fatigue depression bone pain muscle soreness myalgias decreased appetite feelings of nausea and vomiting constipation pancreatitis polyuria polydipsia cognitive impairment kidney stones vertigo and osteopenia or osteoporosis A history of acquired racquet nails brachyonychia may be indicative of bone resorption Radiographically hyperparathyroidism has a pathognomic finding of rugger jersey spine Parathyroid adenomas are very rarely detectable on clinical examination Surgical removal of a parathyroid tumor eliminates the symptoms in most patients In secondary hyperparathyroidism due to lack of Vitamin D absorption the parathyroid gland is behaving normally clinical problems are due to bone resorption and manifest as bone syndromes such as rickets osteomalacia and renal osteodystrophy
Symptoms include intrinsic minus hand deformity paralysis of intrinsic hand muscles and C8 T1 Dermatome distribution numbness Involvement of T1 may result in Horners syndrome with ptosis and miosis Weakness or lack of ability to use specific muscles of the shoulder or arm It can be contrasted to Erb Duchennes palsy which affects C5 and C6
A fungus ball in the lungs may cause no symptoms and may be discovered only with a chest X ray or it may cause repeated coughing up of blood chest pain and occasionally severe even fatal bleeding A rapidly invasive Aspergillus infection in the lungs often causes cough fever chest pain and difficulty breathing Poorly controlled aspergillosis can disseminate through the blood to cause widespread organ damage Symptoms include fever chills shock delirium seizures and blood clots The person may develop kidney failure liver failure causing jaundice and breathing difficulties Death can occur quickly Aspergillosis of the ear canal causes itching and occasionally pain Fluid draining overnight from the ear may leave a stain on the pillow Aspergillosis of the sinuses causes a feeling of congestion and sometimes pain or discharge It can extend beyond the sinuses In addition to the symptoms an X ray or computerised tomography CT scan of the infected area provides clues for making the diagnosis Whenever possible a doctor sends a sample of infected material to a laboratory to confirm identification of the fungus
Some of the symptoms that can occur with metabolic disorders are lethargy weight loss jaundice and seizures The symptoms expressed would vary with the type of metabolic disorder There are four categories of symptoms acute symptoms late onset acute symptoms progressive general symptoms and permanent symptoms
The symptoms of allergic contact dermatitis are very similar to the ones caused by irritant contact dermatitis which makes the first even harder to diagnose The first sign of allergic contact dermatitis is the presence of the rash or skin lesion at the site of exposure Depending on the type of allergen causing it the rash can ooze drain or crust and it can become raw scaled or thickened Also it is possible that the skin lesion does not take the form of a rash but it may include papules blisters vesicles or even a simple red area The main difference between the rash caused by allergic contact dermatitis and the one caused by irritant contact dermatitis is that the latter tends to be confined to the area where the trigger touched the skin whereas in allergic contact dermatitis the rash is more likely to be more widespread on the skin Another characteristic of the allergic contact dermatitis rash is that it usually appears after a day or two after exposure to the allergen unlike irritant contact dermatitis that appears immediately after the contact with the trigger Other symptoms may include itching skin redness or inflammation localized swelling and the area may become more tender or warmer If left untreated the skin may darken and become leathery and cracked Pain can also be present Dermatitis can occur anywhere on the skin but is most common on the hands 22 of people scattered across the body 18 or on the face 17 The rash and other symptoms typically occur 24 to 48 hours after the exposure in some cases the rash may persist for weeks Once an individual has developed a skin reaction to a certain substance it is most likely that they will have it for the rest of their life and the symptoms will reappear when in contact with the allergen
Signs and symptoms of myoglobinuria are usually nonspecific and needs some clinical prudence Therefore among the possible signs and symptoms to look for would be Swollen and painful muscles Fever nausea Delirium elderly individuals Myalgia Dark urine Calcium ion loss
Both types of hepatorenal syndrome share three major components altered liver function abnormalities in circulation and kidney failure As these phenomena may not necessarily produce symptoms until late in their course individuals with hepatorenal syndrome are typically diagnosed with the condition on the basis of altered laboratory tests Most people who develop HRS have cirrhosis and may have signs and symptoms of the same which can include jaundice altered mental status evidence of decreased nutrition and the presence of ascites Specifically the production of ascites that is resistant to the use of diuretic medications is characteristic of type 2 HRS Oliguria which is a decrease in urine volume may occur as a consequence of kidney failure however some individuals with HRS continue to produce a normal amount of urine As these signs and symptoms may not necessarily occur in HRS they are not included in the major and minor criteria for making a diagnosis of this condition instead HRS is diagnosed in an individual at risk for the condition on the basis of the results of laboratory tests and the exclusion of other causes
Tetany is characterized by contraction of distal muscles of the hands carpal spasm with extension of interphalangeal joints and adduction and flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints and feet pedal spasm and is associated with tingling around the mouth and distally in the limbs
The illness resembles a severe influenza with a moderate fever 38 40 C or 101 104 F sore throat chills myalgia headache vomiting and a diffuse red rash maculopapular petechial or purpuric located mostly on the hands and feet The incubation period for the bacteria generally lasts from three ten days As the disease progresses almost half the patients experience migratory polyarthralgias
Osteomalacia is a generalized bone condition in which there is inadequate mineralization of the bone Many of the effects of the disease overlap with the more common osteoporosis but the two diseases are significantly different There are two main causes of osteomalacia
Most individuals with HSE show a decrease in their level of consciousness and an altered mental state presenting as confusion and changes in personality Increased numbers of white blood cells can be found in patients cerebrospinal fluid without the presence of pathogenic bacteria and fungi Patients typically have a fever and may have seizures The electrical activity of the brain changes as the disease progresses first showing abnormalities in one temporal lobe of the brain which spread to the other temporal lobe 7 10 days later Imaging by CT or MRI shows characteristic changes in the temporal lobes see Figure Definite diagnosis requires testing of the cerebrospinal fluid CSF by a lumbar puncture spinal tap for presence of the virus The testing takes several days to perform and patients with suspected Herpes encephalitis should be treated with acyclovir immediately while waiting for test results Atypical stroke like presentation of HSV encephalitis has been described as well and the clinicians should be aware that HSV encephalitis can mimic a stroke
Bullous impetigo can appear around the diaper region axilla or neck The bacteria causes a toxin to be produced that reduces cell to cell stickiness adhesion causing for the top layer of skin epidermis and lower layer of skin dermis to separate Vesicles rapidly enlarge and form the bullae which is a blister more than 5mm across Bullae is also known as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome Other associated symptoms are itching swelling of nearby glands fever and diarrhea Pain is very rare Long term effects once the scabs on the bullous have fallen off scarring is minimal Possible long term effects are kidney disease
Compartment syndrome usually presents within a few hours of an inciting event but may present anytime up to 48 hours after The limb affected by compartment syndrome is often associated with a firm wooden feeling or a deep palpation and is usually described as feeling tight There may also be decrease pulses in the limb along with associated paresthesia Usually the pain cannot be relieved by NSAIDs Range of motion may be limited while the compartment pressure is high In acute compartment syndrome the pain will not be relieved with rest In chronic exertional compartment syndrome the pain will dissipate with rest
Bone and joint pain are common as are limb deformities The elevated PTH has also pleiotropic effects on the blood immune system and neurological system
The most spectacular symptom of lymphatic filariasis is elephantiasis edema with thickening of the skin and underlying tissues which was the first disease discovered to be transmitted by mosquito bites Elephantiasis results when the parasites lodge in the lymphatic system Elephantiasis affects mainly the lower extremities while the ears mucous membranes and amputation stumps are affected less frequently However different species of filarial worms tend to affect different parts of the body Wuchereria bancrofti can affect the legs arms vulva breasts and scrotum causing hydrocele formation while Brugia timori rarely affects the genitals Those who develop the chronic stages of elephantiasis are usually free from microfilariae amicrofilaraemic and often have adverse immunological reactions to the microfilariae as well as the adult worms The subcutaneous worms present with rashes urticarial papules and arthritis as well as hyper and hypopigmentation macules Onchocerca volvulus manifests itself in the eyes causing river blindness onchocerciasis one of the leading causes of blindness in the world Serous cavity filariasis presents with symptoms similar to subcutaneous filariasis in addition to abdominal pain because these worms are also deep tissue dwellers
The symptoms of brain ischemia reflect the anatomical region undergoing blood and oxygen deprivation Ischemia within the arteries branching from the internal carotid artery may result in symptoms such as blindness in one eye weakness in one arm or leg or weakness in one entire side of the body Ischemia within the arteries branching from the vertebral arteries in the back of the brain may result in symptoms such as dizziness vertigo double vision or weakness on both sides of the body Other symptoms include difficulty speaking slurred speech and the loss of coordination The symptoms of brain ischemia range from mild to severe Further symptoms can last from a few seconds to a few minutes or extended periods of time If the brain becomes damaged irreversibly and infarction occurs the symptoms may be permanent Similar to cerebral hypoxia severe or prolonged brain ischemia will result in unconsciousness brain damage or death mediated by the ischemic cascade Multiple cerebral ischemic events may lead to subcortical ischemic depression also known as vascular depression This condition is most commonly seen in elderly depressed patients Late onset depression is increasingly seen as a distinct sub type of depression and can be detected with an MRI
The course of Alzheimers is generally described in three stages with a progressive pattern of cognitive and functional impairment The three stages are described as early or mild middle or moderate and late or severe The disease is known to target the hippocampus which is associated with memory and this is responsible for the first symptoms of memory impairment As the disease progresses so does the degree of memory impairment
Hymenolepiasis does not always have symptoms but they usually are described as abdominal pain loss of appetite itching around the anus irritability and diarrhea However in one study of 25 patients conducted in Peru successful treatment of the infection made no significant difference to symptoms Some authorities report that heavily infected cases are more likely to be symptomatic Symptoms in humans are due to allergic responses or systematic toxaemia caused by waste products of the tapeworm Light infections are usually symptomless whereas infection with more than 2000 worms can cause enteritis abdominal pain diarrhea loss of appetite restlessness irritability restless sleep and anal and nasal pruritus Rare symptoms include increased appetite vomiting nausea bloody diarrhea hives extremity pain headache dizziness and behavioral disturbances Occasionally epileptic seizures occur in infected children Examination of the stool for eggs and parasites confirms the diagnosis The eggs and proglottids of H nana are smaller than H diminuta Proglottids of both are relatively wide and have three testes Identifying the parasites to the species level is often unnecessary from a medical perspective as the treatment is the same for both
Adie syndrome presents with three hallmark symptoms namely at least one abnormally dilated pupil mydriasis which does not constrict in response to light loss of deep tendon reflexes and abnormalities of sweating Other signs may include hyperopia due to accommodative paresis photophobia and difficulty reading Some individuals with Adie syndrome may also have cardiovascular abnormalities
Signs and symptoms of hypovolemia progress with increased loss of fluid volume Early symptoms of hypovolemia include headache fatigue weakness thirst and dizziness The more severe signs and symptoms are often associated with hypovolemic shock These include oliguria cyanosis abdominal and chest pain hypotension tachycardia cold hands and feet and progressively altering mental status
The underdevelopment of the bones in the upper jaw which gives the middle of the face a sunken look This same underdevelopment can make it difficult to eat and can lead to complications such as Nasopharyngeal airway restriction This restriction causes forward head posture which can then lead to back pain neck pain and numbness in the hands and arms The nasopharyngeal airway restriction can also lead to Sleep apnea and snoring Sleep apnea can lead to heart problems endocrine problems increased weight and cognition problems among other issues
Reported symptoms of NCGS are similar to those of celiac disease with most patients reporting both gastrointestinal and non gastrointestinal symptoms In the classical presentation of NCGS gastrointestinal symptoms are similar to those of irritable bowel syndrome and are also not distinguishable from those of wheat allergy but there is a different interval between exposure to wheat and onset of symptoms Wheat allergy has a fast onset from minutes to hours after the consumption of food containing wheat and can be anaphylaxic
The sac which is formed from an outpouching of the peritoneum protrudes in the midline through the umbilicus navel It is normal for the intestines to protrude from the abdomen into the umbilical cord until about the tenth week of pregnancy after which they return to inside the fetal abdomen The omphalocele can be mild with only a small loop of intestines present outside the abdomen or severe containing most of the abdominal organs In severe cases surgical treatment is made more difficult because the infants abdomen is abnormally small having had no need to expand to accommodate the developing organs Larger omphaloceles are associated with a higher risk of cardiac defects
Symptoms of polyps include nasal congestion sinusitis loss of smell thick nasal discharge facial pressure nasal speech and mouth breathing Recurrent sinusitis can result from polyps Long term nasal polyps can cause destruction of the nasal bones and widening of the nose As polyps grow larger they eventually prolapse into the nasal cavity resulting in symptoms The most prominent symptoms of nasal polyps is blockage of the nasal passage People with nasal polyps due to aspirin intolerance often have symptoms known as Samters triad which consists of asthma worse with aspirin a skin rash caused by aspirin and chronic nasal polyps
Confusional arousals are accompanied by mental confusion and disorientation relative lack of response to environmental stimuli and difficulty of awakening the subject Vocalisation accompanied with coherent speech is common Patients may appear upset and some of them become aggressive or agitated As well as for children attempting to awaken or console an adult patient may increase agitation Confusional arousals can occur during or following an arousal of deep sleep see slow wave sleep and upon an attempt of awakening the subject from sleep in the morning In children confusional arousals can often be reproduced artificially by awakening the child during deep sleep However it doesn t have any clinical significance without deeper investigation Children living an episode of confusional arousal typically sit up in bed whimper cry moan and may utter words like no or go away They remain distressed and inconsolable despite all parental efforts Paradoxically parental efforts can rather increase agitation of the child The onset of symptoms is usually within 2 and 3 hours of sleep onset at the time of transition from slow wave sleep to a lighter sleep stage and those events can last from 10 to 30 minutes Patients generally wake up without any recollection of the event It is necessary to distinguish confusional arousals in adults from children
Symptoms of the disease first appear from 10 to 30 years after infection Incipient GPI is usually manifested by neurasthenic difficulties such as fatigue headaches insomnia dizziness etc As the disease progresses mental deterioration and personality changes occur Typical symptoms include loss of social inhibitions asocial behavior gradual impairment of judgment concentration and short term memory euphoria mania depression or apathy Subtle shivering minor defects in speech and Argyll Robertson pupil may become noticeable Delusions common as the illness progresses tend to be poorly systematized and absurd They can be grandiose melancholic or paranoid These delusions include ideas of great wealth immortality thousands of lovers unfathomable power apocalypsis nihilism self guilt self blame or bizarre hypochondriacal complaints Later the patient experiences dysarthria intention tremors hyperreflexia myoclonic jerks confusion seizures and severe muscular deterioration Eventually the paretic dies bedridden cachectic and completely disoriented frequently in a state of status epilepticus
Clinical features of CRPS have been found to be inflammation resulting from the release of certain proinflammatory chemical signals from the nerves sensitized nerve receptors that send pain signals to the brain dysfunction of the local blood vessels ability to constrict and dilate appropriately and maladaptive neuroplasticity The signs and symptoms of CRPS usually manifest near the injury site The most common symptoms are extreme pain including burning stabbing grinding and throbbing The pain is out of proportion to the severity of the initial injury Moving or touching the limb is often intolerable With diagnosis of either CRPS types I or II patients may develop burning pain and allodynia Both syndromes are also characterized by autonomic dysfunction which presents with temperature changes usually localized but can be global cyanosis and or edema The patient may also experience localized swelling extreme sensitivity to nonpainful stimuli such as wind water noise and vibrations extreme sensitivity to touch by themselves other people and even light clothing or bedding blankets abnormally increased sweating or absent sweating changes in skin temperature alternating between overly warm and cold changes in skin colouring from white and mottled to bright red or reddish violet changes in skin texture waxy shiny thin tight skin softening and thinning of bones joint tenderness or stiffness changes in nails and hair delayed or increased growth brittle nails hair that easily break muscle spasms muscle loss atrophy tremors dystonia allodynia hyperalgesia and decreased restricted ability and painful movement of affected body part Drop attacks falls almost fainting and fainting spells are infrequently reported as are visual problems The symptoms of CRPS vary in severity and duration Since CRPS is a systemic problem potentially any organ can be affected Symptoms may change over time and they can vary from person to person The more dynamic symptoms especially vascular aspects edema temperature and location of pain can change numerous times a day Previously CRPS was considered to have three stages however more recent studies suggest people affected by CRPS do not progress through sequential stages and the staging system is no longer in wide use Growing evidence instead points towards distinct sub types of CRPS
Signs that are found in people with Horners syndrome on the affected side of the face include the following
Patients can present with fever headache myalgias and malaise Laboratory tests may reveal thrombocytopenia leukopenia and evidence of liver damage
A few days after ingestion epigastric pain fever vomiting and loss of appetite resulting from migration of larvae through intestinal wall to the abdominal cavity will appear in the patient Migration in the subcutaneous tissues under the skin causes intermittent migratory painful pruritic swellings cutaneous larva migrans Patches of edema appear after the above symptoms clear and are usually found on the abdomen These lesions vary in size and can be accompanied by pruritus itchy anus rash and stabbing pain Swellings may last for 1 to 4 weeks in a given area and then reappear in a different location Migration to other tissues visceral larva migrans can result in cough hematuria blood in urine ocular eye involvement meningitis encephalitis and eosinophilia Eosinophilic myeloencephalitis may also result from invasion of the central nervous system by the larvae
RLS sensations range from pain or an aching in the muscles to an itch you cant scratch a buzzing sensation an unpleasant tickle that wont stop a crawling feeling or limbs jerking while awake The sensations typically begin or intensify during quiet wakefulness such as when relaxing reading studying or trying to sleep It is a spectrum disease with some people experiencing only a minor annoyance and others having major disruption of sleep and impairments in quality of life The sensations and the need to move may return immediately after ceasing movement or at a later time RLS may start at any age including childhood and is a progressive disease for some while the symptoms may remit in others In a survey among members of the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation it was found that up to 45 of patients had their first symptoms before the age of 20 years An urge to move usually due to uncomfortable sensations that occur primarily in the legs but occasionally in the arms or elsewhere The sensations are unusual and unlike other common sensations Those with RLS have a hard time describing them using words or phrases such as uncomfortable painful antsy electrical creeping itching pins and needles pulling crawling buzzing and numbness It is sometimes described similar to a limb falling asleep or an exaggerated sense of positional awareness of the affected area The sensation and the urge can occur in any body part the most cited location is legs followed by arms Some people have little or no sensation yet still have a strong urge to move Motor restlessness expressed as activity which relieves the urge to move Movement usually brings immediate relief although temporary and partial Walking is most common however stretching yoga biking or other physical activity may relieve the symptoms Continuous fast up and down movements of the leg and or rapidly moving the legs toward then away from each other may keep sensations at bay without having to walk Specific movements may be unique to each person Worsening of symptoms by relaxation Sitting or lying down reading plane ride watching TV can trigger the sensations and urge to move Severity depends on the severity of the persons RLS the degree of restfulness duration of the inactivity etc Variability over the course of the day night cycle with symptoms worse in the evening and early in the night Some experience RLS only at bedtime while others experience it throughout the day and night Most people experience the worst symptoms in the evening and the least in the morning restless legs feel similar to the urge to yawn situated in the legs or arms These symptoms of RLS can make sleeping difficult for many patients and a 2005 National Sleep Foundation poll shows the presence of significant daytime difficulties resulting from this condition These problems range from being late for work to missing work or events because of drowsiness Patients with RLS who responded reported driving while drowsy more than patients without RLS These daytime difficulties can translate into safety social and economic issues for the patient and for society RLS may contribute to higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders in RLS patients
Anosmia can have a number of harmful effects People with sudden onset anosmia may find food less appetizing though congenital anosmics rarely complain about this and none report a loss in weight Loss of smell can also be dangerous because it hinders the detection of gas leaks fire and spoiled food The common view of anosmia as trivial can make it more difficult for a patient to receive the same types of medical aid as someone who has lost other senses such as hearing or sight Many experience one sided loss of smell often as a result of minor head trauma This type of anosmia is normally only detected if both of the nostrils are tested separately Using this method of testing each nostril separately will often show a reduced or even completely absent sense of smell in either one nostril or both something which is often not revealed if both nostrils are simultaneously tested Losing an established and sentimental smell memory e g the smell of grass of the grandparents attic of a particular book of loved ones or of oneself has been known to cause feelings of depression Loss of the ability to smell may lead to the loss of libido though this usually does not apply to loss of smell present at birth Often people who have loss of smell at birth report that they pretended to be able to smell as children because they thought that smelling was something that older mature people could do or did not understand the concept of smelling but did not want to appear different from others When children get older they often realize and report to their parents that they do not actually possess a sense of smell often to the surprise of their parents
In many cases there is pain and discomfort in a joint which increases over time While it can affect any bone about half of cases show multiple sites of damage Avascular necrosis most commonly affects the ends of long bones such as the femur Other common sites include the humerus knees shoulders ankles and the jaw
Acute Stage Appears four to eight hours after exposure Symptoms such as headache irritating cough and shortness of breath upon physical exertion Subacute Stage Symptoms persist without further exposure and increase in severity Symptoms include shortness of breath upon exertion chronic coughing physical weakness occasional fever and sweating decrease in appetite aches and pains Chronic Stage Debilitating effects are now considered long term Symptoms include severe shortness of breath chronic coughing physical weakness occasional fever and sweating at night decrease in appetite and general aches and pains These symptoms develop between four and eight hours after exposure to the antigens In acute attacks the symptoms mimic pneumonia or flu In chronic attacks there is a possibility of the victim going into shock and dying from the attack
While bubbles can form anywhere in the body DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders elbows knees and ankles Joint pain the bends accounts for about 60 to 70 of all altitude DCS cases with the shoulder being the most common site for altitude and bounce diving and the knees and hip joints for saturation and compressed air work Neurological symptoms are present in 10 to 15 of DCS cases with headache and visual disturbances being the most common symptom Skin manifestations are present in about 10 to 15 of cases Pulmonary DCS the chokes is very rare in divers and has been observed much less frequently in aviators since the introduction of oxygen pre breathing protocols The table below shows symptoms for different DCS types
Food allergies usually have an onset from minutes to one to two hours Symptoms may include rash hives itching of mouth lips tongue throat eyes skin or other areas swelling of lips tongue eyelids or the whole face difficulty swallowing runny or congested nose hoarse voice wheezing shortness of breath diarrhea abdominal pain lightheadedness fainting nausea or vomiting Symptoms of allergies vary from person to person and may vary from incident to incident Serious danger regarding allergies can begin when the respiratory tract or blood circulation is affected The former can be indicated by wheezing a blocked airway and cyanosis the latter by weak pulse pale skin and fainting When these symptoms occur the allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis occurs when IgE antibodies are involved and areas of the body that are not in direct contact with the food become affected and show severe symptoms Untreated this can proceed to vasodilation and a low blood pressure situation called anaphylactic shock Young children may exhibit dermatitis eczema on face scalp and other parts of the body in older children knees and elbows are more commonly affected Children with dermatitis are at greater than expected risk of also exhibiting asthma and allergic rhinitis

The signs and symptoms of seizures vary depending on the type The most common and stereotypical type of seizure is convulsive 60 typically called a tonic clonic seizure Two thirds of these begin as focal seizures prior to developing into tonic clonic seizures The remaining 40 of seizures are non convulsive an example of which is absence seizure When EEG monitoring shows evidence of a seizure but no symptoms are present it is referred to as a subclinical seizure
Asymptomatic Asymptomatic bacteriuria is bacteriuria without accompanying symptoms of a urinary tract infection and is commonly caused by the bacterium Escherichia coli Other potential pathogens are Klebsiella spp and group B streptococci It is more common in women in the elderly in residents of long term care facilities and in people with diabetes bladder catheters and spinal cord injuries People with a long term Foley catheter always show bacteriuria Chronic asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in as many as 50 of the population in long term care There is an association between asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women with low birth weight preterm delivery cystitis infection of the newborn and fetus death However most of these studies were graded as poor quality Bacteriuria in pregnancy also increases the risk of preeclampsia
Most infections are light almost asymptomatic In heavy infections symptoms can include abdominal pain chronic diarrhea anemia ascites toxemia allergic responses sensitization caused by the absorption of the worms allergenic metabolites can lead to intestinal obstruction and may eventually cause death of the patient
Clinically the earliest lesions may appear as a hives like red raised rash but could also appear dermatitic targetoid lichenoid nodular or even without a rash essential pruritus Tense bullae eventually erupt most commonly at the inner thighs and upper arms but the trunk and extremities are frequently both involved Any part of the skin surface can be involved Oral lesions are present in a minority of cases The disease may be acute but can last from months to years with periods of exacerbation and remission Several other skin diseases may have similar symptoms However milia are more common with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita because of the deeper antigenic targets A more ring like configuration with a central depression or centrally collapsed bullae may indicate linear IgA disease Nikolskys sign is negative unlike pemphigus vulgaris where it is positive
Sleepwalking is characterized by partial arousal during non rapid eye movement NREM sleep typically during the first third of the night dream content that may or may not be recalled when awake dream congruent motor behavior that may be simple or complex impaired perception of the environment impaired judgement planning and problem solving Despite how it is portrayed in many cultures eyes closed and walking with arms outstretched the sleepwalkers eyes are open but may appear as a glassy eyed stare or blank expression and pupils are dilated They are often disoriented consequent to awakening the sleepwalker may be confused and perplexed and might not know why or how they got out of bed however the disorientation will fade within minutes They may talk while sleepwalking but the talk typically does not make sense to the observer There are varying degrees of amnesia associated with sleepwalking ranging from no memory at all vague memories or a narrative

Symptoms include
Proteinuria often causes no symptoms and it may only be discovered incidentally Foamy urine is considered a cardinal sign of proteinuria but only a third of people with foamy urine have proteinuria as the underlying cause It may also be caused by bilirubin in the urine bilirubinuria retrograde ejaculation pneumaturia air bubbles in the urine due to a fistula or drugs such as pyridium
Agoraphobia is a condition where individuals become anxious in unfamiliar environments or where they perceive that they have little control Triggers for this anxiety may include wide open spaces crowds social anxiety or traveling even short distances Agoraphobia is often but not always compounded by a fear of social embarrassment as the agoraphobic fears the onset of a panic attack and appearing distraught in public Most of the time they avoid these areas and stay in the comfort of their haven usually their home Agoraphobia is also defined as a fear sometimes terrifying by those who have experienced one or more panic attacks In these cases the patient is fearful of a particular place because they have experienced a panic attack at the same location at a previous time Fearing the onset of another panic attack the patient is fearful or even avoids a location Some refuse to leave their homes even in medical emergencies because the fear of being outside of their comfort areas is too great The person with this condition can sometimes go to great lengths to avoid the locations where they have experienced the onset of a panic attack Agoraphobia as described in this manner is actually a symptom professionals check when making a diagnosis of panic disorder Other syndromes like obsessive compulsive disorder or post traumatic stress disorder can also cause agoraphobia Essentially any irrational fear that keeps one from going outside can cause the syndrome People with agoraphobia may experience temporary separation anxiety disorder when certain other individuals of the household depart from the residence temporarily such as a parent or spouse or when they are left home alone Such temporary conditions can result in an increase in anxiety or a panic attack or feeling the need to separate themselves from family or maybe friends People with agoraphobia sometimes fear waiting outside for long periods of time that symptom can be called macrophobia

The clinical presentation of TMA although dependent on the type typically includes fever microangiopathic hemolytic anemia see schistocytes in a blood smear kidney failure thrombocytopenia and neurological manifestations Generally renal complications are particularly predominant with Shiga toxin associated hemolytic uremic syndrome STx HUS and atypical HUS whereas neurologic complications are more likely with TTP Individuals with milder forms of TTP may have recurrent symptomatic episodes including seizures and vision loss With more threatening cases of TMA and also as the condition progresses without treatment multi organ failure or injury is also possible as the hyaline thrombi can spread to and affect the brain kidneys heart liver and other major organs
Nipple discharge is fluid from the nipple with or without squeezing the breast The discharge can be milky clear green purulent bloody or faintly yellow The consistency can be thick thin sticky or watery
GISTs may present with trouble swallowing gastrointestinal bleeding or metastases mainly in the liver Intestinal obstruction is rare due to the tumors outward pattern of growth Often there is a history of vague abdominal pain or discomfort and the tumor has become rather large by time the diagnosis is made
Development Pedophilia emerges before or during puberty and is stable over time It is self discovered not chosen For these reasons pedophilia has been described as a disorder of sexual preference phenomenologically similar to a heterosexual or homosexual orientation These observations however do not exclude pedophilia from being classified as a mental disorder since pedophilic acts cause harm and mental health professionals can sometimes help pedophiles to refrain from harming children In response to misinterpretations that the American Psychiatric Association considers pedophilia a sexual orientation because of wording in its printed DSM 5 manual which distinguishes between paraphilia and what it calls paraphilic disorder subsequently forming a division of pedophilia and pedophilic disorder the association commented S exual orientation is not a term used in the diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder and its use in the DSM 5 text discussion is an error and should read sexual interest They added In fact APA considers pedophilic disorder a paraphilia not a sexual orientation This error will be corrected in the electronic version of DSM 5 and the next printing of the manual They said they strongly support efforts to criminally prosecute those who sexually abuse and exploit children and adolescents and also support continued efforts to develop treatments for those with pedophilic disorder with the goal of preventing future acts of abuse
Schizoaffective disorder is defined by mood disorder free psychosis in the context of a long term psychotic and mood disorder Psychosis must meet criterion A for schizophrenia which may include delusions hallucinations disorganized thinking and speech or behavior and negative symptoms Both delusions and hallucinations are classic symptoms of psychosis Delusions are false beliefs which are strongly held despite evidence to the contrary Beliefs should not be considered delusional if they are in keeping with cultural beliefs Delusional beliefs may or may not reflect mood symptoms for example someone experiencing depression may or may not experience delusions of guilt Hallucinations are disturbances in perception involving any of the five senses although auditory hallucinations or hearing voices are the most common Negative symptoms include alogia lack of speech blunted affect reduced intensity of outward emotional expression avolition lack of motivation and anhedonia inability to experience pleasure Negative symptoms can be more lasting and more debilitating than positive symptoms of psychosis Mood symptoms are of mania hypomania mixed episode or depression and tend to be episodic rather than continuous A mixed episode represents a combination of symptoms of mania and depression at the same time Symptoms of mania include elevated or irritable mood grandiosity inflated self esteem agitation risk taking behavior decreased need for sleep poor concentration rapid speech and racing thoughts Symptoms of depression include low mood apathy changes in appetite or weight disturbances in sleep changes in motor activity fatigue guilt or feelings of worthlessness and suicidal thinking DSM 5 states that if a patient only experiences psychotic symptoms during a mood episode their diagnosis is Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features and not Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder If the patient experiences psychotic symptoms without mood symptoms for longer than a two week period their diagnosis is either Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder If mood disorder episodes are present for the majority and residual course of the illness and up until the diagnosis the patient can be diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder

Mittelschmerz is characterized by lower abdominal and pelvic pain that occurs roughly midway through a womans menstrual cycle The pain can appear suddenly and usually subsides within hours although it may sometimes last two or three days In some cases it can last up to the following cycle In some women the mittelschmerz is localized enough so that they can tell which of their two ovaries provided the egg in a given month Because ovulation occurs on a random ovary each cycle the pain may switch sides or stay on the same side from one cycle to another
Symptoms in infested humans include watery diarrhea abdominal pain edema weight loss borborygmus stomach growling and depressed levels of potassium and albumin in the blood In humans the parasites damage the cells of the intestinal wall This damage interferes with the absorption of nutrients and the maintenance of a proper electrolyte balance Untreated C philippinensis infestations are often fatal
Generally speaking there are four different types of complaints that relate to intestinal gas which may present individually or in combination
Meningococcus can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease It initially produces general symptoms like fatigue fever and headache and can rapidly progress to neck stiffness coma and death in 10 of cases Petechiae occur in about 50 of cases Chance of survival is highly correlated with blood cortisol levels with lower levels prior to steroid administration corresponding with increased patient mortality Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis are easily confused with those caused by other bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae Suspicion of meningitis is a medical emergency and immediate medical assessment is recommended Current guidance in the United Kingdom is that if a case of meningococcal meningitis or septicaemia infection of the blood is suspected intravenous antibiotics should be given and the ill person admitted to the hospital This means that laboratory tests may be less likely to confirm the presence of Neisseria meningitidis as the antibiotics will dramatically lower the number of bacteria in the body The UK guidance is based on the idea that the reduced ability to identify the bacteria is outweighed by reduced chance of death Septicaemia caused by Neisseria meningitidis has received much less public attention than meningococcal meningitis even though septicaemia has been linked to infant deaths Meningococcal septicaemia typically causes a purpuric rash that does not lose its color when pressed with a glass slide non blanching and does not cause the classical symptoms of meningitis This means the condition may be ignored by those not aware of the significance of the rash Septicaemia carries an approximate 50 mortality rate over a few hours from initial onset Other severe complications include Waterhouse Friderichsen syndrome a massive usually bilateral hemorrhage into the adrenal glands caused by fulminant meningococcemia adrenal insufficiency and disseminated intravascular coagulation Not all instances of a purpura like rash are due to meningococcal septicaemia other possible causes such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ITP a platelet disorder and Henoch Schönlein purpura also need prompt investigation
Cause Clonorchiasis sinensis is a trematode fluke which is part of the phylum Platyhelminthes The parasitic worm is as long as 10 to 25 mm and lives in the bile ducts of the liver It is a hermaphroditic fluke that requires two intermediate hosts The eggs of the worms are passed in fecal matter into a body of water and are then ingested by mollusks The water snail is the first intermediate host in which a miracidium an embryonated egg discharged in stool goes through its developmental stages sporocyst rediae and cercariae Freshwater fish are a second intermediate host for the parasitic worm They become infected when the larva cercaria of the worm leaves the snail and penetrates the flesh of the fish Humans then become infected by eating infected fish that has been undercooked smoked pickled or salted and from there the cycle repeats Clonorchiasis is endemic in the Far East especially in Korea Japan Taiwan and Southern China Clonorchiasis has been reported in areas to which it is not endemic including the United States In such cases the infection follows the ingestion of undercooked or pickled freshwater fish imported from one of the endemic areas and containing metacercariae
Fever and headache are the cardinal features confusion is a late feature and coma bears a poor prognosis Meningism is absent in a fifth of patients with TB meningitis Patients may also have focal neurological deficits
Major depression significantly affects a persons family and personal relationships work or school life sleeping and eating habits and general health A person having a major depressive episode usually exhibits a low mood which pervades all aspects of life and an inability to experience pleasure in previously enjoyable activities Depressed people may be preoccupied with or ruminate over thoughts and feelings of worthlessness inappropriate guilt or regret helplessness or hopelessness Other symptoms of depression include poor concentration and memory withdrawal from social situations and activities reduced sex drive irritability and thoughts of death or suicide Insomnia is common in the typical pattern a person wakes very early and cannot get back to sleep Hypersomnia or oversleeping can also happen Some antidepressants may also cause insomnia due to their stimulating effect In severe cases depressed people may have psychotic symptoms These symptoms include delusions or less commonly hallucinations usually unpleasant People who have had previous episodes with psychotic symptoms are more likely to have them with future episodes A depressed person may report multiple physical symptoms such as fatigue headaches or digestive problems physical complaints are the most common presenting problem in developing countries according to the World Health Organizations criteria for depression Appetite often decreases resulting in weight loss although increased appetite and weight gain occasionally occur Family and friends may notice agitation or lethargy Older depressed people may have cognitive symptoms of recent onset such as forgetfulness and a more noticeable slowing of movements Depressed children may often display an irritable rather than a depressed mood most lose interest in school and show a steep decline in academic performance Diagnosis may be delayed or missed when symptoms are interpreted as normal moodiness Elderly people may not present with classical depressive symptoms Diagnosis and treatment is further complicated in that the elderly are often simultaneously treated with a number of other drugs and often have other concurrent diseases
An individual displaying MERRFs syndrome will manifest not only a single symptom but patients regularly display more than one affected body part at a time It has been observed that patients with MERRF syndrome will primarily display myoclonus as a first symptom There may also be seizures cerebellar ataxia and myopathy Secondary features can include dementia optic atrophy bilateral deafness peripheral neuropathy spasticity multiple lipomata and or cardiomyopathy with Wolff Parkinson White syndrome Most patients will not exhibit all of these symptoms but more than one of these symptoms will be present in a patient who has been diagnosed with MERRF disease Mitochondrial disorders including MERRF may present at any age Due to the multiple symptoms presented by the individual the severity of the syndrome is very difficult to evaluate
Chest pain is one of the common symptoms of acute pericarditis It is usually of sudden onset occurring in the anterior chest and often has a sharp quality that worsens with breathing in or coughing due to inflammation of the pleural surface at the same time The pain may be reduced with sitting up and leaning forward while worsened with lying down and also may radiate to the back to one or both trapezius ridges However the pain can also be dull and steady resembling the chest pain in an acute myocardial infarction As with any chest pain other causes must also be ruled out such as GERD pulmonary embolism muscular pain etc A pericardial friction rub is a very specific sign of acute pericarditis meaning the presence of this sign invariably indicates presence of disease However absence of this sign does not rule out disease This rub can be best heard by the diaphragm of the stethoscope at the left sternal border arising as a squeaky or scratching sound resembling the sound of leather rubbing against each other This sound should be distinguished from the sound of a murmur which is similar but sounds more like a swish sound than a scratching sound The pericardial rub is said to be generated from the friction generated by the two inflamed layers of the pericardium however even a large pericardial effusion does not necessarily present a rub The rub is best heard during the maximal movement of the heart within the pericardial sac namely during atrial systole ventricular systole and the filling phase of early ventricular diastole Fever may be present since this is an inflammatory process
Gastrointestinal People with ulcerative colitis usually present with diarrhea mixed with blood of gradual onset that persists for an extended period of time weeks Additional symptoms may include fecal incontinence increased frequency of bowel movements mucus discharge and nocturnal defecations With proctitis inflammation of the rectum people with UC may experience urgency or rectal tenesmus which is the urgent desire to evacuate the bowels but with the passage of little stool Tenesmus may be misinterpreted as constipation due to the urge to defecate despite small volume of stool passage Bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain may be more prominent features in severe disease The severity of abdominal pain with UC varies from mild discomfort to very painful bowel movements and abdominal cramping High frequency of bowel movements weight loss nausea fatigue and fever are also common during disease flares Chronic bleeding from the GI tract chronic inflammation and iron deficiency often leads to anemia which can affect quality of life The clinical presentation of ulcerative colitis depends on the extent of the disease process Up to 15 of individuals may have severe disease upon initial onset of symptoms A substantial proportion up to 45 of people with a history of UC without any ongoing symptoms clinical remission have objective evidence of ongoing inflammation Ulcerative colitis is associated with a generalized inflammatory process that can affect many parts of the body Sometimes these associated extra intestinal symptoms are the initial signs of the disease
It is an autosomal recessive disorder in which mild clinical manifestations contrast with radiological appearances of gross metaphyseal undermodeling Most patients present with mild genu valgum The elbows are unable to extend fully There may be widening of the lower femora and clavicles Bones can sometimes be fragile but fracturing is usually not common Patients may present with dental caries mandibular prognathism spinal alignment and disproportionate limb lengthening Mental development physical development and height are usually normal Most patients with Pyles diseases will have symptoms that vary from person to person Symptoms are 5 29 of people have
The neuromuscular symptoms of hypocalcemia are caused by a positive bathmotropic effect i e increased responsiveness due to the decreased interaction of calcium with sodium channels Since calcium blocks sodium channels and inhibits depolarization of nerve and muscle fibers reduced calcium lowers the threshold for depolarization The symptoms can be recalled by the mnemonic CATs go numb convulsions arrhythmias tetany and numbness in the hands and feet and around the mouth
People with esophageal candidiasis typically present with difficult or painful swallowing Longstanding esophageal candidiasis can result in weight loss There is often concomitant thrush in the mouth Some patients present with esophageal candidiasis as a first presentation of systemic candidiasis
The characteristic symptoms of allergic rhinitis are rhinorrhea excess nasal secretion itching sneezing fits and nasal congestion and obstruction Characteristic physical findings include conjunctival swelling and erythema eyelid swelling with Dennie Morgan folds lower eyelid venous stasis rings under the eyes known as allergic shiners swollen nasal turbinates and middle ear effusion There can also be behavioral signs in order to relieve the irritation or flow of mucus people may wipe or rub their nose with the palm of their hand in an upward motion an action known as the nasal salute or the allergic salute This may result in a crease running across the nose or above each nostril if only one side of the nose is wiped at a time commonly referred to as the transverse nasal crease and can lead to permanent physical deformity if repeated enough People might also find that cross reactivity occurs For example people allergic to birch pollen may also find that they have an allergic reaction to the skin of apples or potatoes A clear sign of this is the occurrence of an itchy throat after eating an apple or sneezing when peeling potatoes or apples This occurs because of similarities in the proteins of the pollen and the food There are many cross reacting substances Hay fever is not a true fever meaning it does not cause a core body temperature in the fever over 37 5 38 3 C 99 5 100 9 F
Children and adults with selective mutism are fully capable of speech and understanding language but are completely unable to speak in certain situations though speech is expected of them The behaviour may be perceived as shyness or rudeness by others A child with selective mutism may be completely silent at school for years but speak quite freely or even excessively at home There is a hierarchical variation among people with this disorder some people participate fully in activities and appear social but do not speak others will speak only to peers but not to adults others will speak to adults when asked questions requiring short answers but never to peers and still others speak to no one and participate in few if any activities presented to them In a severe form known as progressive mutism the disorder progresses until the person with this condition no longer speaks to anyone in any situation even close family members To meet DSM 5 criteria for selective mutism one must exhibit the following Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations in which there is an expectation for speaking e g at school despite speaking in other situations The disturbance interferes with educational or occupational achievement or with social communication The duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month not limited to the first month of school The failure to speak is not due to a lack of knowledge of the spoken language required in the social situation The disturbance is not better accounted for by a communication disorder e g childhood onset fluency disorder and does not occur exclusively in people with autism spectrum disorders or psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia Selective mutism is strongly associated with other anxiety disorders particularly social anxiety disorder In fact the majority of children diagnosed with selective mutism also have social anxiety disorder 100 of participants in two studies and 97 in another Some researchers therefore speculate that selective mutism may be an avoidance strategy used by a subgroup of children with social anxiety disorder to reduce their distress in social situations Particularly in young children selective mutism can sometimes be confused with an autism spectrum disorder especially if the child acts particularly withdrawn around their diagnostician which can lead to incorrect diagnosis and treatment Although autistic people may also be selectively mute they often display other behaviors stimming repetitive behaviors social isolation even among family members not always answering to name for example that set them apart from a child with selective mutism Some autistic people may be selectively mute due to anxiety in unfamiliar social situations If mutism is entirely due to autism spectrum disorder it cannot be diagnosed as selective mutism as stated in the last item on the list above The former name elective mutism indicates a widespread misconception among psychologists that selective mute people choose to be silent in certain situations while the truth is that they often wish to speak but are unable to do so To reflect the involuntary nature of this disorder the name was changed to selective mutism in 1994 The incidence of selective mutism is not certain Due to the poor understanding of this condition by the general public many cases are likely undiagnosed Based on the number of reported cases the figure is commonly estimated to be 1 in 1000 0 1 However a 2002 study in The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry estimated the incidence to be 0 71
Sickle cell trait is a hemoglobin genotype AS and is generally regarded as a benign condition However individuals with sickle cell trait may have rare complications For example in November 2010 Dr Jeffery K Taubenberger of the National Institutes of Health discovered the earliest proof of sickle cell disease while looking for the virus of the 1918 flu during the autopsy of an African American soldier Taubenbergers autopsy results showed that the soldier had had a sickle cell crisis that contributed to his death even though he had only one copy of the gene There have been calls to reclassify sickle cell trait as a disease state based on its malignant clinical presentations Significance may be greater during exercise
The period between infection and the first symptoms incubation period is typically 1 3 months in humans This period may be as short as four days or longer than six years depending on the location and severity of the wound and the amount of virus introduced Initial symptoms of rabies are often nonspecific such as fever and headache As rabies progresses and causes inflammation of the brain and meninges symptoms can include slight or partial paralysis anxiety insomnia confusion agitation abnormal behavior paranoia terror and hallucinations The person may also have fear of water The symptoms eventually progress to delirium and coma Death usually occurs 2 to 10 days after first symptoms Survival is almost unknown once symptoms have presented even with intensive care Rabies has also occasionally been referred to as hydrophobia fear of water throughout its history It refers to a set of symptoms in the later stages of an infection in which the person has difficulty swallowing shows panic when presented with liquids to drink and cannot quench their thirst Any mammal infected with the virus may demonstrate hydrophobia Saliva production is greatly increased and attempts to drink or even the intention or suggestion of drinking may cause excruciatingly painful spasms of the muscles in the throat and larynx Since the infected individual cannot swallow saliva and water the virus has a much higher chance of being transmitted because it multiplies and accumulates in the salivary glands and is transmitted through biting Hydrophobia is commonly associated with furious rabies which affects 80 of rabies infected people The remaining 20 may experience a paralytic form of rabies that is marked by muscle weakness loss of sensation and paralysis this form of rabies does not usually cause fear of water
People with anterograde amnesic syndromes may present with widely varying degrees of forgetfulness Some with severe cases have a combined form of anterograde and retrograde amnesia sometimes called global amnesia In the case of drug induced amnesia it may be short lived and patients can recover from it In the other case which has been studied extensively since the early 1970s patients often have permanent damage although some recovery is possible depending on the nature of the pathophysiology Usually some capacity for learning remains although it may be very elementary In cases of pure anterograde amnesia patients have recollections of events prior to the injury but cannot recall day to day information or new facts presented to them after the injury occurred In most cases of anterograde amnesia patients lose declarative memory or the recollection of facts but they retain nondeclarative memory often called procedural memory For instance they are able to remember and in some cases learn how to do things such as talking on the phone or riding a bicycle but they may not remember what they had eaten earlier that day for lunch One extensively studied anterograde amnesiac patient codenamed H M demonstrated that despite his amnesia preventing him from learning new declarative information procedural memory consolidation was still possible albeit severely reduced in power He along with other patients with anterograde amnesia were given the same maze to complete day after day Despite having no memory of having completed the maze the day before unconscious practice of completing the same maze over and over reduced the amount of time needed to complete it in subsequent trials From these results Corkin et al concluded despite having no declarative memory i e no conscious memory of completing the maze exists the patients still had a working procedural memory learning done unconsciously through practice This supports the notion that declarative and procedural memory are consolidated in different areas of the brain In addition patients have a diminished ability to remember the temporal context in which objects were presented Certain authors claim the deficit in temporal context memory is more significant than the deficit in semantic learning ability described below
These signs and symptoms refer to epidemic typhus as it is the most important of the typhus group of diseases Signs and symptoms begin with sudden onset of fever and other flu like symptoms about one to two weeks after being infected Five to nine days after the symptoms have started a rash typically begins on the trunk and spreads to the extremities This rash eventually spreads over most of the body sparing the face palms and soles Signs of meningoencephalitis begin with the rash and continue into the second or third weeks Other signs of meningoencephalitis include sensitivity to light photophobia altered mental status delirium or coma Untreated cases are often fatal
Depending on the organism the signs and symptoms vary Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus can enter the blood stream while Ancylostoma braziliensis cannot Signs and symptoms of Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus are given in corresponding page In Ancylostoma braziliensis as the larvae are in an abnormal host they do not mature to adults but instead migrate through the skin until killed by the hosts inflammatory response This migration causes local intense itching and a red serpiginous lesion Treatment with a single dose of oral ivermectin results in cure rates of 94 100
Symptoms start with slowly developing dysarthria difficulty speaking and cerebellar truncal ataxia unsteadiness and then the progressive dementia becomes more evident Loss of memory can be the first symptom of GSS Extrapyramidal and pyramidal symptoms and signs may occur and the disease may mimic spinocerebellar ataxias in the beginning stages Myoclonus spasmodic muscle contraction is less frequently seen than in Creutzfeldt Jakob disease Many patients also exhibit nystagmus involuntary movement of the eyes visual disturbances and even blindness or deafness The neuropathological findings of GSS include widespread deposition of amyloid plaques composed of abnormally folded prion protein Four clinical phenotypes are recognized typical GSS GSS with areflexia and paresthesia pure dementia GSS and Creutzfeldt Jakob disease like GSS
People with fear of flying experience intense persistent fear or anxiety when they consider flying as well as during flying They will avoid flying if they can and the fear anxiety and avoidance cause significant distress and impair their ability to function Take off bad weather and turbulence appear to be the most anxiety provoking aspects of flying The most extreme manifestations can include panic attacks or vomiting at the mere sight or mention of an aircraft or air travel Around 60 of people with fear of flying report having some other anxiety disorder
Hyperandrogenism affects 5 10 of women of reproductive age Hyperandrogenism can affect both men and women but is more noticeable in women since elevated levels of androgens in women may facilitate virilization Because hyperandrogenism is characterized by elevated male sex hormone levels symptoms of hyperandrogenism in men are often negligible Hyperandrogenism in women is typically diagnosed in late adolescence with a medical evaluation The medical evaluation usually consists of a pelvic exam observation of external symptoms and a blood test measuring androgen levels Symptoms may include the following
Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy usually become symptomatic four to five days after beginning treatment reaching a peak at around day 10 and then slowly improving over the course of a few weeks Mucositis associated with radiotherapy usually appears at the end of the second week of treatment and may last for six to eight weeks As a result of cell death in reaction to chemo or radio therapy the mucosal lining of the mouth becomes thin may slough off and then become red inflamed and ulcerated The ulcers may become covered by a yellowish white fibrin clot called a pseudomembrane Peripheral erythema is usually present Ulcers may range from 0 5 cm to greater than 4 cm Oral mucositis can be severely painful The degree of pain is usually related to the extent of the tissue damage Pain is often described as a burning sensation accompanied by reddening Due to pain the patient may experience trouble speaking eating or even opening the mouth Dysgeusia or an alteration in taste perception is common especially for those who are receiving concomitant radiation therapy to the neck and mouth area Taste blindness or an altered sense of taste is a temporary condition that occurs because of effects on taste buds that are mostly located in the tongue Sometimes only partial recovery of taste occurs Common complaints are of food tasting too sweet or too bitter or of a continuous metallic taste
There are three main disorders caused by Hermansky Pudlak syndrome which result in these symptoms
People with Hodgkin lymphoma may present with the following symptoms
Signs Reduced movement of the ribcage during breathing reduced breath sounds on the affected side s and a dull feeling when the chest is pressed are common signs observed during examination for fibrothorax Sharp chest pain with deep breaths or coughing may be seen in some cases Severe cases of fibrothorax can lead to respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation and cause abnormally high levels of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream
MELAS is a condition that affects many of the bodys systems particularly the brain and nervous system encephalo and muscles myopathy In most cases the signs and symptoms of this disorder appear in childhood following a period of normal development Children with MELAS often have normal early psychomotor development until the onset of symptoms between 2 and 10 years old Though less common infantile onset may occur and may present as failure to thrive growth retardation and progressive deafness Onset in older children typically presents as recurrent attacks of a migraine like headache anorexia vomiting and seizures Children with MELAS are also frequently found to have short stature Most people with MELAS have a buildup of lactic acid in their bodies a condition called lactic acidosis Increased acidity in the blood can lead to vomiting abdominal pain extreme tiredness fatigue muscle weakness loss of bowel control and difficulty breathing Less commonly people with MELAS may experience involuntary muscle spasms myoclonus impaired muscle coordination ataxia hearing loss heart and kidney problems diabetes epilepsy and hormonal imbalances
There is usually an itch with generalised dry flaky thick skin of the palm of a hand Frequently one hand is affected but it can be in both If the back of the hand is affected it may appear as reddish circles like in ringworm Sometimes there are no symptoms The feet may be affected as in two feet one hand syndrome
Symptoms typically begin in childhood and are progressive often resulting in death by early adulthood Symptoms of PKAN begin before middle childhood and most often are noticed before ten years of age Symptoms include dystonia repetitive uncontrollable muscle contractions that may cause jerking or twisting of certain muscle groups dysphagia dysarthria due to muscle groups involved in speech being involved rigidity stiffness of limbs tremor writhing movements dementia spasticity weakness seizures rare toe walking retinitis pigmentosa another degenerative disease that affects the individuals retina often causing alteration of retinal color and progressive deterioration of the retina at first causing night blindness and later resulting in a complete loss of vision 25 of individuals experience an uncharacteristic form of PKAN that develops post 10 years of age and follows a slower more gradual pace of deterioration than those pre 10 years of age These individuals face significant speech deficits as well as psychiatric and behavioral disturbances Being a progressive degenerative nerve illness PKAN leads to early immobility and often death by early adulthood Death occurs prematurely due to infections such as pneumonia and the disease in itself is technically not life limiting
Signs and symptoms are related to type and severity of the heart defect Symptoms frequently present early in life but it is possible for some CHDs to go undetected throughout life Some children have no signs while others may exhibit shortness of breath cyanosis fainting heart murmur under development of limbs and muscles poor feeding or growth or respiratory infections Congenital heart defects cause abnormal heart structure resulting in production of certain sounds called heart murmur These can sometimes be detected by auscultation however not all heart murmurs are caused by congenital heart defects
Iron overload People with thalassemia can get an overload of iron in their bodies either from the disease itself or from frequent blood transfusions Too much iron can result in damage to the heart liver and endocrine system which includes glands that produce hormones that regulate processes throughout the body The damage is characterized by excessive deposits of iron Without adequate iron chelation therapy almost all patients with beta thalassemia accumulate potentially fatal iron levels Infection People with thalassemia have an increased risk of infection This is especially true if the spleen has been removed Bone deformities Thalassemia can make the bone marrow expand which causes bones to widen This can result in abnormal bone structure especially in the face and skull Bone marrow expansion also makes bones thin and brittle increasing the risk of broken bones Enlarged spleen The spleen aids in fighting infection and filters unwanted material such as old or damaged blood cells Thalassemia is often accompanied by the destruction of a large number of red blood cells and the task of removing these cells causes the spleen to enlarge Splenomegaly can make anemia worse and it can reduce the life of transfused red blood cells Severe enlargement of the spleen may necessitate its removal Slowed growth rates anemia can cause the growth of a child to slow down Puberty may also be delayed in children with thalassemia Heart problems Diseases such as congestive heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms may be associated with severe thalassemia
Acute mast cell leukemia is a rapidly progressive disorder with leukemic mast cells in blood and in large numbers in marrow The common signs and symptoms include fever headache flushing of face and trunk The typical cutaneous mast cell infiltrates of urticaria pigmentosa are usually not present before during or after diagnosis in patients who have mast cell leukemia Symptoms include abdominal pain bone pain and peptic ulcer which are more prevalent than in other subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia These former symptoms are due to release of a substance called histamine from neoplastic mast cells Enlargement of the liver and spleen or hepatosplenomegaly is characteristic The mast cells release also many anticoagulants like heparin which can lead to serious bleeding Liver and splenic dysfunction also contributes to hemorrhage Involvement of the bone can lead to osteoporosis Abdominal ultrasound or computerized tomography CT scanning is used to look for hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy Plain radiography and bone densitometry can be used to assess bone involvement and the presence of osteoporosis Endoscopy and biopsy can be useful if gut involvement is suspected
Some patients may experience Fatigue Easy Bruising Abnormal Bleeding Anemia Thrombocytopenia DyspneaIf the blast count gets too high and clog up blood vessels some patients may experience Slurred Speech Headache Confusion Weakness on one side of the body Sleepiness
The primary symptom is cough with sputum that may be purulent The illness may also cause shortness of breath or wheezing Upper respiratory tract infections often precede acute bronchitis with overlapping symptoms including headache nasal congestion sore throat Fever and other systemic symptoms are rare in acute bronchitis their presence raises suspicion for influenza or pneumonia
The physical manifestations of TSC are due to the formation of hamartia malformed tissue such as the cortical tubers hamartomas benign growths such as facial angiofibroma and subependymal nodules and very rarely cancerous hamartoblastomas The effect of these on the brain leads to neurological symptoms such as seizures intellectual disability developmental delay and behavioral problems
Most signs and symptoms of AML are caused by the crowding out in bone marrow of space for normal blood cells to develop A lack of normal white blood cell production makes people more susceptible to infections A low red blood cell count anemia can cause fatigue paleness shortness of breath and palpitations A lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising bleeding from the nose epistaxis small blood vessels on the skin petechiae or gums or bleeding with minor trauma Other symptoms may include fever fatigue worse than what can be attributed to anaemia alone weight loss and loss of appetite Enlargement of the spleen may occur in AML but it is typically mild and asymptomatic Lymph node swelling is rare in most types of AML except for acute myelomonocytic leukemia AMML The skin can be involved in the form of leukemia cutis Sweets syndrome or non specific findings flat lesions macules raised lesion papules pyoderma gangrenosum and vasculitis Some people with AML may experience swelling of the gums because of infiltration of leukemic cells into the gum tissue Involvement of other parts of the body such as the gastrointestinal tract respiratory tract and other parts is possible but less common One area which has particular importance for treatment is whether there is involvement of the meninges around the central nervous system
Chest pain may present in different ways depending upon the underlying diagnosis Chest pain may also vary from person to person based upon age sex weight and other differences Chest pain may present as a stabbing burning aching sharp or pressure like sensation in the chest Chest pain may also radiate or move to several other areas of the body This may include the neck left or right arms cervical spine back and upper abdomen Other associated symptoms with chest pain can include nausea vomiting dizziness shortness of breath anxiety and sweating The type severity duration and associated symptoms of chest pain can help guide diagnosis and further treatment
Symptoms commonly include nausea vomiting cold sweat headache dizziness tiredness loss of appetite and increased salivation Occasionally tiredness can last for hours to days after an episode of motion sickness known as sopite syndrome Rarely severe symptoms such as the inability to walk ongoing vomiting or social isolation may occur while rare complications may include dehydration electrolyte problems or a lower esophageal tear from severe vomiting
People with CHS have light skin and silvery hair albinism and frequently complain of solar sensitivity and photophobia Other signs and symptoms vary considerably but frequent infections and neuropathy are common The infections involve mucous membranes skin and the respiratory tract Affected children are susceptible to infection by Gram positive and gram negative bacteria and fungi with Staphylococcus aureus being the most common infectious cause Infections in CHS patients tend to be very serious and even life threatening Neuropathy often begins in the teenage years and becomes the most prominent problem Few patients with this condition live to adulthood Most children with Chédiak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage known as the accelerated phase or the lymphoma like syndrome in which defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the bodys organs The accelerated phase is associated with fever episodes of abnormal bleeding overwhelming infections and organ failure These medical problems are usually life threatening in childhood
The degree of hyperglycemia can change over time depending on the metabolic cause for example impaired glucose tolerance or fasting glucose and it can depend on treatment Temporary hyperglycemia is often benign and asymptomatic Blood glucose levels can rise well above normal and cause pathological and functional changes for significant periods without producing any permanent effects or symptoms During this asymptomatic period an abnormality in carbohydrate metabolism can occur which can be tested by measuring plasma glucose Chronic hyperglycemia at above normal levels can produce a very wide variety of serious complications over a period of years including kidney damage neurological damage cardiovascular damage damage to the retina or damage to feet and legs Diabetic neuropathy may be a result of long term hyperglycemia Impairment of growth and susceptibility to certain infections can occur as a result of chronic hyperglycemia Acute hyperglycemia involving glucose levels that are extremely high is a medical emergency and can rapidly produce serious complications such as fluid loss through osmotic diuresis It is most often seen in persons who have uncontrolled insulin dependent diabetes The following symptoms may be associated with acute or chronic hyperglycemia with the first three composing the classic hyperglycemic triad Polyphagia frequent hunger especially pronounced hunger Polydipsia frequent thirst especially excessive thirst Polyuria increased volume of urination not an increased frequency although it is a common consequence Blurred vision Fatigue Restlessness Weight loss or weight gain Poor wound healing cuts scrapes etc Dry mouth Dry or itchy skin Tingling in feet or heels Erectile dysfunction Recurrent infections external ear infections swimmers ear Delayed gastric emptying Cardiac arrhythmia Stupor Coma Seizures Abnormal movements chorea choreoathetosis ballism dystonia opsoclonus myoclonus parkinsonism hemifacial spasm and Holmes tremorFrequent hunger without other symptoms can also indicate that blood sugar levels are too low This may occur when people who have diabetes take too much oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin for the amount of food they eat The resulting drop in blood sugar level to below the normal range prompts a hunger response Polydipsia and polyuria occur when blood glucose levels rise high enough to result in excretion of excess glucose via the kidneys which leads to the presence of glucose in the urine This produces an osmotic diuresis Signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis may include Ketoacidosis Kussmaul hyperventilation deep rapid breathing Confusion or a decreased level of consciousness Dehydration due to glycosuria and osmotic diuresis Increased thirst Fruity smelling breath odor Nausea and vomiting Abdominal pain Impairment of cognitive function along with increased sadness and anxiety Weight lossHyperglycemia causes a decrease in cognitive performance specifically in processing speed executive function and performance Decreased cognitive performance may cause forgetfulness and concentration loss
Many people with long QT syndrome have no signs or symptoms When symptoms occur they are generally caused by abnormal heart rhythms arrhythmias most commonly a form of ventricular tachycardia called Torsades de pointes TdP If the arrhythmia reverts to a normal rhythm spontaneously the affected person may experience lightheadedness known as presyncope or faint which may be preceded by a fluttering sensation in the chest If the arrhythmia continues the affected person may experience a cardiac arrest which if untreated may lead to sudden death Those with LQTS may also experience seizure like activity non epileptic seizure as a result of reduced blood flow to the brain during an arrhythmia Epilepsy is also associated with certain types of long QT syndrome The arrhythmias that lead to faints and sudden death are more likely to occur in specific circumstances in part determined by which genetic variant is present While arrhythmias can occur at any time in some forms of LQTS arrhythmias are more commonly seen in response to exercise or mental stress LQT1 in other forms following a sudden loud noise LQT2 and in some forms during sleep or immediately upon waking LQT3 Some rare forms of long QT syndrome affect other parts of the body leading to deafness in the Jervell and Lange Nielsen form of the condition and periodic paralysis in the Andersen Tawil LQT7 form
Symptoms include weakness confusion decreased breathing rate and decreased reflexes As well as nausea low blood pressure low blood calcium abnormal heart rhythms and asystole dizziness and sleepiness Abnormal heart rhythms and asystole are possible complications of hypermagnesemia related to the heart Magnesium acts as a physiologic calcium blocker which results in abnormalities of the electrical conduction system of the heart Consequences related to serum concentration
Thrombosis is generally defined by the type of blood vessel affected arterial or venous thrombosis and the precise location of the blood vessel or the organ supplied by it
Symptoms of a broken nose include bruising swelling tenderness pain deformity and or bleeding of the nose and nasal region of the face The patient may have difficulty breathing or excessive nosebleeds if the nasal mucosa are damaged The patient may also have bruising around one or both eyes
The majority of people with DISH are not symptomatic and the findings are an incidental imaging abnormality In some the x ray findings may correspond to symptoms of back stiffness with flexion extension or with mild back pain Back pain or stiffness may be worse in the morning Rarely large anterior cervical spine osteophytes may affect the esophagus or the larynx and cause pain difficulty swallowing or even dyspnea Similar calcification and ossification may be seen at peripheral entheseal sites including the shoulder iliac crest ischial tuberosity trochanters of the hip tibial tuberosities patellae and bones of the hands and or feet DISH can be a complicating factor when suffering from trauma involving the spine It increases the risk of unstable fractures involving the intervertebral disc and the calcified ossified ligaments which influences the need for surgical treatment
People with aphasia may experience any of the following behaviors due to an acquired brain injury although some of these symptoms may be due to related or concomitant problems such as dysarthria or apraxia and not primarily due to aphasia Aphasia symptoms can vary based on the location of damage in the brain Signs and symptoms may or may not be present in individuals with aphasia and may vary in severity and level of disruption to communication Often those with aphasia may have a difficulty with naming objects so they might use words such as thing or point at the objects When asked to name a pencil they may say it is a thing used to write
People suffering from sacroiliitis can often experience symptoms in a number of different ways however it is commonly related to the amount of pressure that is put onto the sacroiliac joint Sacroiliitis pain is typically axial meaning that the location of the condition is also where the pain is occurring Symptoms commonly include prolonged inflammatory pain in the lower back region hips or buttocks However in more severe cases pain can become more radicular and manifest itself in seemingly unrelated areas of the body including the legs groin and feet Symptoms are typically aggravated by Transitioning from sitting to standing Walking or standing for extended periods of time Running Climbing stairs Taking long strides Rolling over in bed Bearing more weight on one leg
The most common symptom associated with bloating is a sensation that the abdomen is full or distended Rarely bloating may be painful or cause shortness of breath Pains that are due to bloating will feel sharp and cause the stomach to cramp These pains may occur anywhere in the body and can change locations quickly They are so painful that they are sometimes mistaken for heart pains when they develop on the upper left side of the chest Pains on the right side are often confused with problems in the appendix or the gallbladder One symptom of gas that is not normally associated with it is the hiccup Hiccups are harmless and will diminish on their own they also help to release gas that is in the digestive tract before it moves down to the intestines and causes bloating Important but uncommon causes of abdominal bloating include ascites and tumors
Ear pain can present in one or both ears It may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as fever sensation of the world spinning ear itchiness or a sense of fullness in the ear The pain may or may not worsen with chewing The pain may also be continuous or intermittent Ear pain due to an infection is the most common in children and can occur in babies Adults may need further evaluation if they have hearing loss dizziness or ringing in the ear Additional red flags include diabetes a weakened immune system swelling seen on the outer ear or swelling along the jaw
In most cases AIT is characterized by onset of pain firmness tenderness redness or swelling in the anterior aspect of the neck Patients will also present with a sudden fever difficulty swallowing and difficulty controlling the voice Symptoms may be present from 1 to 180 days with most symptoms lasting an average of about 18 days The main issue associated with the diagnosis of AIT is differentiating it from other more commonly seen forms of thyroid conditions Pain fever and swelling are often much more severe and continue to get worse in people who have AIT compared to those with other thyroid conditions
The time between exposure to the virus and development of symptoms called the incubation period is 1 4 days most commonly 1 2 days Many infections however are asymptomatic The onset of symptoms is sudden and initial symptoms are predominately non specific including fever chills headaches muscle pain or aching a feeling of discomfort loss of appetite lack of energy fatigue and confusion These symptoms are usually accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as a dry cough sore or dry throat hoarse voice and a stuffy or runny nose Coughing is the most common symptom Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur including nausea vomiting diarrhea and gastroenteritis especially in children The standard influenza symptoms typically last for 2 8 days A 2021 study suggests influenza can cause long lasting symptoms in a similar way to long COVID Symptomatic infections are usually mild and limited to the upper respiratory tract but progression to pneumonia is relatively common Pneumonia may be caused by the primary viral infection or by a secondary bacterial infection Primary pneumonia is characterized by rapid progression of fever cough labored breathing and low oxygen levels that cause bluish skin It is especially common among those who have an underlying cardiovascular disease such as rheumatic heart disease Secondary pneumonia typically has a period of improvement in symptoms for 1 3 weeks followed by recurrent fever sputum production and fluid buildup in the lungs but can also occur just a few days after influenza symptoms appear About a third of primary pneumonia cases are followed by secondary pneumonia which is most frequently caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus
The main clinical signs that indicate meningism are nuchal rigidity Kernigs sign and Brudzinskis signs None of the signs are particularly sensitive in adults with meningitis nuchal rigidity was present in 30 and Kernigs or Brudzinskis sign only in 5
Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of unstable angina is controversial Until recently unstable angina was assumed to be angina pectoris caused by disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque with partial thrombosis and possibly embolization or vasospasm leading to myocardial ischemia However sensitive troponin assays reveal rise of cardiac troponin in the bloodstream with episodes of even mild myocardial ischemia Since unstable angina is assumed to occur in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia without troponin release the concept of unstable angina is being questioned with some calling for retiring the term altogether
Patients presenting with a headache originating at the posterior skull base should be evaluated for ON This condition typically presents as a paroxysmal lancinating or stabbing pain lasting from seconds to minutes and therefore a continuous aching pain likely indicates a different diagnosis Bilateral symptoms are present in one third of cases
